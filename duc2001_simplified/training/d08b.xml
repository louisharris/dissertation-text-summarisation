<HEADLINE><HL>Thousands Mark Total Eclipse With Prayers, Dancing and
Drum-Beating</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>GENERAL SANTOS CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of peole
prayed, cheered, danced, beat drums and observed other traditions
today as a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of
Indonesia and the southern Philippines.
   The sun was blacked out by the shadow of the moon for up to four
minutes along a 108-mile swath that moved from the Indian Ocean
across Indonesia and the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.
   A partial eclipse was visible across a wide area of Asia as far
west as India _ including Southeast Asia, China, Japan and New
Guinea as well as parts of Australia and the Pacific islands.
   Scientists said the eclipse would end at sunset in the Gulf of
Alaska.
   Clouds obscured the solar spectacular in Jakarta, Indonesia,
Hong Kong and in the eastern Mindanao city of Davao, where
thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe the
eclipse.
   But it was visible for about 3 minutes in this city about 650
miles southeast of Manila despite early scattered clouds. President
Corazon Aquino flew in to witness the event.
   Richard Fisher of the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder,
Colo., said that despite scattered clouds, scientists were
confident they had taken useful pictures of the eclipse.
   In Jakarta, Wilson Sinambela of the National Institute of
Aeronautics said a total eclipse was observed in several parts of
the country, including by about 1,000 tourists in the South Sumatra
capital Palembang.
   He said thousands of Indonesians prayed and beat drums to herald
the start of the eclipse, which began in southwestern Sumatra
before heading on to the Philippines.
   In Kuala Lumpur, where a partial eclipse blocked out about 80
percent of the sun, some Malaysian Hindus visited temples to pray
for protection against harm during the eclipse.
   In Kurukshetra, India, an estimated 1 million pilgrims dipped
into the waters of the sacred Sannihit and Brahmsarover tanks after
a public address system announced the start of the eclipse. Hymns
were chanted and conch shells blown during the ceremony about 90
miles north of New Delhi.
   Clouds blocked the first moments of the eclipse in General
Santos City. But the cloud cover broke, setting off wild cheering
among the thousands who watched the phenomenon in a scorching
tropical heat.
   Street lights switched on, and members of the Naragcas tribe, in
the city for a festival, danced in the streets to the beat of drums.
   In Baguio City, 130 miles north of Manila, pregnant women of the
local Ilocano community rinsed their hair during the eclipse with
water dripped from burned rice straws in a traditional ritual.
   According to local superstition, babies conceived during or
shortly before an eclipse will be deformed unless their mothers
practice the ritual.
   Many other Filipinos marked the eclipse by going to church. The
Philippines is Asia's only predominately Christian country.
   ``This phenomenon is a clear reminder from God for mankind to
repent its sins,'' said Theresa Teopengco, a government employee.
   Officials said about 20,000 tourists and scientists from around
the world had come to the southern Philippines to watch the
eclipse, the last one expected here for at least 50 years.
   Scientists said the area afforded the best opportunity to
witness and study the eclipse because skies are usually clear this
time of year.
   But in Davao City, 60 miles to the northeast, morning clouds
sent hundreds scurrying to the airport for flights to General
Santos.
   Church bells in Davao tolled while police and civilians set off
firecrackers and fired weapons in the air to mark the eclipse.
   In Manila, thousands turned out under clear skies to see the
partial eclipse that blocked about 75 percent of the sun's surface
at its height.
   Police said four people were injured when a passenger bus
collided with a jeep during the eclipse.
   ``The drivers were probably looking skyward when the accident
occurred,'' said policeman Ricardo Manansala. ``It's impossible to
gaze at the sky and drive a vehicle at the same time.''
   Solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the
Earth and the sun. The Chinese first recorded a total solar eclipse
in 2137 B.C., regarding them as signs of a battle to death between
the sun and the dragon.

<HEADLINE><HL>Crowds Drawn By Wonder of Partial Solar Eclipse</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Solar telescopes yielded views of
flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon
Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible
across western North America.
   ``There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,'' said
Ed Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, where 600
children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37
percent of the sun's surface at 10:50 a.m. PST.
   ``It was certainly a lively crowd,'' he said. ``There was a
festival atmosphere.''
   ``It's kind of neat,'' said map maker Jan Mayne, who was among
dozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar
telescopes at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial
eclipse, those watching through Caltech's telescopes could see
mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun. Also
visible were gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group of
sunspots that on Monday produced the most intense solar flare _ a
burst of heat and radiation _ since 1984.
   ``There was a stunning view of that large sunspot group,'' Krupp
said.
   The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a
diagonal line stretching roughly from Mazatlan, Mexico, northeast to
Dallas and Chicago.
   Views were best farther west and north. But because the eclipse
was partial most people didn't notice the slight dimming of sunlight.
   ``You can't tell the difference between a partial eclipse and a
second-stage smog alert,'' joked one observer at Caltech.
   Several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets in
downtown Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of
the sun at 9:13 a.m. AST.
   In San Francisco, the moon eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 9:52
a.m., but the event wasn't visible because of clouds that were so
thick they delayed arriving flights at the airport.
   A slight dimming was noticed in Seattle, where partly cloudy
skies allowed a glimpse of the 56 percent eclipse at 10:10 a.m. PST.
   The percentage of the sun blocked out and time of maximum eclipse
at other locations included 52 percent at 11:28 a.m. MST in
Edmonton, Alberta; 46 percent at 11:09 a.m. MST in Boise, Idaho; 36
percent at 11:10 a.m. MST in Salt Lake City; 35 percent at 9:58 a.m.
PST in Las Vegas; 25 percent at 11:17 a.m. MST in Denver; 15 percent
at 12:42 p.m. CST in Minneapolis, and a measly 3 percent at 12:44
p.m. CST in Milwaukee.
   Fearful that people would suffer eye damage during the eclipse,
scientists warned against staring at the sun directly or through
inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic film or
filters.
   Alan MacRobert, spokesman for Sky &amp; Telescope magazine, said
there were 245 known eye injuries in the United States after an
eclipse in 1970, but warnings about the danger reduced the number to
three during a 1984 partial eclipse.
   From any single spot on Earth, a partial eclipse occurs every
several years, said Ken Libbrecht, as assistant professor of
astrophysics at Caltech.
   Total solar eclipses are visible from any single location roughly
once every four centuries, though they are visible about every two
years from somewhere on Earth, he said.
   The next total eclipse will happen July 11, 1991, sweeping across
Hawaii, the Pacific Ocean, lower Baja California in Mexico, the west
coast of Central America and finally Colombia and Brazil, MacRobert
said.

<HEADLINE><HL>Oldest Known Record of Total Eclipse Is Younger Than Thought, Study
Says</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Scientists missed by 150 years in dating the
oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tablet
that also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researchers
said today.
   Scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse,
recorded on a clay tablet found in Syria, occurred on May 3, 1375
B.C.
   But in today's issue of the British journal Nature, two Dutch
scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened
about 150 years later, on March 5, 1223 B.C.
   The tablet was found in 1948 in the ruins of Ugarit, an ancient
city near Syria's Mediterranean coast. One side appears to tell of a
solar eclipse, and the reverse side reads, ``Two livers were
examined: danger.''
   ``Apparently the anxiety caused by the eclipse of the Sun and the
sudden appearance of Mars had to be resolved by an explanation
through liver divination,'' wrote the researchers from the
University of Amsterdam and Leiden University.
   They concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tablet
misidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred. The
new study indicated the eclipse really happened in late February or
early March.
   In addition, the text apparently indicates that Mars was visible
at the time of the eclipse, the Dutch researchers said.
   They compared those criteria and the likely age range for the
tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible from
Ugarit. Only the event in 1223 B.C. fills the bill, the researchers
said.
   In an accompanying editorial, Christopher B.F. Walker of the
British Museum in London cautioned that their conclusion ``can best
be regarded as a plausible hypothesis.''
   The translation of the tablet's text is not certain, and the
study assumes that citizens of Ugarit followed an Egyptian-style
calendar, for which no supporting evidence is available, he said.
   Even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed,
it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar
eclipse, Edwin Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory in Los
Angeles, said in a telephone interview.
   The next-oldest record was made in China in the Eighth Century
B.C., said Krupp, a researcher in ancient astronomy.

<HEADLINE><HL>Weather Could Cloud Eclipse Spectacle for Finns</HL></HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to
mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping
to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun.
   The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening,
when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weather
with a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday.
   In the eastern town of Joensuu, a television news broadcast late
Saturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzle
falling.
   The solar eclipse in Finland starts at 4:03 a.m. Sunday (9:03
p.m. EDT Saturday). At that time, the moon will begin gradually
moving between the Earth and the sun.
   The total eclipse begins at 4:52 a.m. in Helsinki and will last
83 seconds. After the total phase of the eclipse, the moon will
move away, uncovering more and more of the sun. The eclipse ends at
5:45 a.m. in Helsinki.
   About 10,000 people _ including 3,000 foreigners _ have
converged on Joensuu, about 50 miles from the Soviet border. There
conditions there are considered especially good for viewing the
eclipse _ weather permitting.
   In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after
sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon. At
Joensuu, 310 miles northeast of Helsinki, the sun will be 5 degrees
above the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers.
   The sun rises unusually early during summer in the extreme
northern latitudes where Finland is located. The sun comes up
unusually late during winter.
   Ten months ago, Joensuu hired an ``eclipse secretary'' to handle
arrangements for the expected influx of visitors.
   But that official, Marjut Cadia, said she had underestimated the
interest in the event.
   ``We completely sold out the 10,000 special eyeglasses we made
for this event, and our extra stock is finished too,'' she said in
a television interview Saturday.
   During the past week, newspapers, television and radio have been
full of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice for
spectators not to stare directly into the sun.
   Some eclipse viewers won't have to worry about the clouds,
because they will be above them. Finnair, the national airline, has
arranged a dozen special flights for eclipse watchers, and private
companies with small planes will provide more.
   The eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide from
the northern Baltic Sea and southeast Finland, across the Kola
Peninsula and northeast Soviet Union, to the Aleutian Islands near
Alaska.
   Scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse,
including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun.
However, scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than in
longer eclipses, such as the seven-minute eclipse seen from
northern Kenya on June 30, 1973.
   Seppo Linnaluoto of the Ursa Astronomical Association said the
best place for observations of this eclipse will be the northeast
Soviet Union.
   The last total eclipse to be seen in Finland occurred in 1945.

<HEADLINE><HL>Mexico Gets Ready Early For Total Solar Eclipse</HL></HEADLINE>



<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Mexico, where sun worship has passed from
ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers, is gearing up early for
the day next year when the sun will be blotted out.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a
Cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as
``the slar eclipse of the century'' on July 11. Posters have been
placed in Mexico City subways promoting the event, and resorts
along the eclipse's path are scrambling to accommodate the expected
rush of tourists.
   ``It's the most important eclipse in history,'' says Miguel Gil
Guzman, secretary-general of the Mexican Astronomical Society.
   This one will cut a swath across one of the most populous
regions of the globe, turning day to night for an estimated 50
million residents in 14 of Mexico's 31 states. The eclipse path
reaches from Hawaii through Mexico to Brazil.
   The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes,
the maximum length for a total solar eclipse.
   On July 11, the moon will pass between the planet and the sun,
abruptly swallowing midday's light, except for a weird glow on the
horizon.
   People from British Columbia to Buenos Aires will experience at
least a partial eclipse.
   Viewing conditions may be poor because of the Latin American
rainy season.
   But the special government commission, Eclipse 1991, is banking
on the clouds to roll in the country's financial favor.
   The commission bills the northwestern state of Baja California
Sur as the best place to watch because the state has an average of
300 cloudless days a year.
   Baja California Sur alone plans to spend $26.5 million for
public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in
millions more from tourism.
   For three years, scientists and astronomy buffs have been
staking out turf in Mexico. It will be the last chance to see a
total solar eclipse this century.
   Most hotels along the eclipse route are full for July 11.
Tourism officials are seeking private homes and campgrounds,
schools and auditoriums to house the influx.
   Baja California Sur's tourist facilities can only handle 120,000
visitors, and 90 percent of that capacity is booked, tourism
director Rodolfo Palacios says.
   The state says at least four ships will pressed into service as
floating hotels.
   Some 13,500 amateur and professional astronomers from the United
States, Japan, Soviet Union, China, Canada, England, France and
Germany have confirmed reservations. Some tourists have been booked
into one hotel even before it is completed.
   The Pacific coast region of Nayarit is bracing for about 1
million visitors, about double the population.
   Cuernavaca, 35 miles south of Mexico City, is hosting a
geophysicists' congress during the week of the eclipse.
   At least one expedition plans to view the show from the
17,887-foot Popocapetl volcano, the country's second-highest peak.
   Others plan to see it from boats at sea.
   An eclipse is an astronomical coincidence. The moon is 400 times
smaller than the sun, but because it is 400 times closer to the
earth, the smaller body appears to cover the larger one.
   Rosy rays of light will shoot out around the moon's edges,
forming what astronomers call a corona, or crown.
   Temperatures will drop at least 5{ degrees. The stars will come
out; the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter will shine.
Streetlights will be triggered on.
   The National University is developing six half-hour
documentaries on eclipses and 10 TV spots on the dangers of looking
at the sun, astronomy professor Jesus Galindo says.
   Since September, the university newspaper has been publishing
installments of a book called ``Eclipse'' that will be translated
into Indian languages.
   The government plans to supervise the production of special
lenses for viewing an eclipse.

<HEADLINE><HL>  BEST SEATS ARE SOLD OUT FOR CELESTIAL SHOW  </HL></HEADLINE>
<TEXT>  Nature stages one of its most spectacular shows on July 11 -- a total eclipse
of the sun, one that'll be among the longest this century. And the best
viewing spots are virtually in California's back yard: The Big Island of
Hawaii and the southern Baja California peninsula.;    Unfortunately, you can
probably forget about seeing it, because, unless you get lucky, you can't get
there from here anymore.  
        With some people having booked trips as long as three years in advance,
airline seats, rental cars and hotel reservations range from difficult to
impossible to get, travel agents and others report.;    "The closer you get to
the event, the less there is" available, said Paul Kloetzel, president of
O'Brien Travel Service in San Jose. "It's an event, and it rarely, rarely
happens. There is a certain element of traveler out there (and) there's an
awful lot of those people.";    The eclipse will be seen from Hawaii to
central Brazil. If clouds don't spoil the show, viewers along that path will
see the moon slip slowly in front of the sun. The sky will grow darker, as if
dusk has fallen, until the sun is completely blocked out for a few minutes as
the moon's shadow falls on the earth. Stars will shine.;    The length of this
"period of totality," as it's known, will depend on where viewers are along
the path. The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds --
at the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico's west coast. In
the Bay Area, the moon will cover about 55 percent of the sun's surface.;   
Among fans of the heavens, a solar eclipse inspires awe, fascination and
grandeur. Firm estimates aren't available, but blotted-out-sun watchers are
expected to number more than 100,000 -- perhaps 50,000 to 70,000 in Hawaii and
an equal number in Baja.;    "The effect of it -- the view of seeing the sun
disappear little by little and then actually having the (blue) sky disappear
and having the birds stop singing -- it's miraculous," said Irving Hochman, a
member of the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers. "It really is the most
spectacular natural phenomenon possible.";    Bob Bruynesteyn, head of the San
Mateo Astronomical Society, puts it succinctly: "Not too many people have
stood in the shadow of the moon.";    It's romantic images like these that are
inspiring a last-minute surge of would-be eclipse-watchers, travel agents
say.;    Pamela and Daniel Dei Rossi of Campbell were among those scramblers.
Learning of the eclipse only a month ago, they began calling travel agents.
"But they basically said they wouldn't even try -- everything was booked,"
said Pamela Dei Rossi.;    They called places where relatives had stayed in
Mexico. No luck. She called a friend in Hawaii for a place to stay, but
airline ticket and rental car problems still loomed. Then, good fortune
struck. She called a travel agent who had taken a class with West Valley
College astronomy instructor Tom Bullock. Bullock was leading a group to
Hawaii, and some late cancellations came up. The Dei Rossis were in.;    "We
are so excited," Pamela Dei Rossi said. "We had given up.";    Though travel
arrangements are now tough to come by, some opportunities remain.;    One is
to go by the back door.;    Hawaii and Baja are the prime spots, because --
statistically at least -- they offer the best chance of cloudless skies. But
after enveloping the Big Island and then slicing across southern Baja, the
moon's shadow will cross the Gulf of California and race across the southern
flank of Mexico and down the west coast of Central America. Two of Mexico's
biggest cities, Gaudalajara and Mexico City, lie in the path of totality. So
does Mazatlan.;    Puerto Vallarta, a resort city, is only a short distance
away. Airline ticket availability is reported spotty for the resorts but still
available for other destinations.;    Another possibility is to search around
for groups making the trip that have had late cancellations, as the Dei Rossis
did.;    What probably won't work is the overland route to Baja. From the
border to the northern edge of where the eclipse will be total is about a
16-hour drive, said Raul Cardenas, the Mexican consul in San Jose. Mexican
authorities will have a checkpoint from July 7-15 at Guerrero Negro, about
halfway down the peninsula. Travelers who can't produce original documents
showing they have accommodations will be turned back, Cardenas said. Those
staying in private homes must also produce a letter of some kind, he said.;   
Even firm reservations may not be all they seem. Airlines routinely overbook
seats, in expectation of no-shows. With the eclipse, there's concern the
overbooking could be particularly bad, especially on inter-island flights in
Hawaii. That's important because many eclipse-watchers haven't been able to
book a flight directly to the Big Island. They've had to get flights into
somewhere else, like Honolulu, and do a short hop to where they want to be.;  
 "These flights are so overbooked it's actually a laughingstock," said
O'Brien's Kloetzel. "I have a feeling this is going to be an ugly scene."; IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED; An eight-page brochure on the July 11 eclipse is available
for $2 from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 390 Ashton Ave., San
Francisco, CA 94112. Special Mylar viewers for safely observing the eclipse
are also available for another $2.  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE><HL>  SKY-WATCHERS CHASING A SHADOW
HAWAIIAN, MEXICAN ECLIPSE ZONES BRACE FOR
ASTRONOMICAL CROWDS  </HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>  Of all the extravagant plans inspired by this week's solar eclipse, none beats
the Earth Evacuation Project.;    Participants in Mexico believe the total
eclipse, which will send a shadow racing from Hawaii to Brazil as the moon
crosses directly in front of the sun, will cause volcanic eruptions, signaling
Earthlings to start bailing out on spaceships to the fourth dimension,
according to Intergalactic Guardian command leader "Angel," who declined to
give a last name.  
        While Angel and his followers meditate to prepare for their journey, French
New Age musician Jean-Michel Jarre is coordinating an elaborate
sound-and-light show to play at the foot of the pyramids in Teotihuacan, north
of the capital.;    Also on E-day, July 11, crowded cruise ships will linger
off Mexico's Pacific Coast, and thousands of U.S. tourists will drive south
into Baja California, which, usually boasting clear skies, is being billed as
the world's most promising site from which to view nature's own light show.;  
 Eclipse fans from Japan to New York to the Netherlands are expected in
droves, but Californians -- because of their proximity to Baja and propensity
for mystical phenomena -- should be conspicuous.;    However, the chic hot
spot for eclipse watchers won't be Mexico, but the big island of Hawaii, where
the 18,000 tourists who would be there anyway to enjoy the sunshine will be
joined by an additional 30,000 or more coming to watch the sun go out for four
minutes.;    Even more people might be there for the show, but for the lack of
seats on flights to the island. Most visitors will be funneled in through the
relatively small airport at Kailua.;    Airlines are adding scores of flights
to ferry thousands of people from neighboring islands in the hours just before
the eclipse.;    Car rental companies have shipped in 3,000 or so extra cars.;
   More than one caller from the mainland has asked the visitors' bureau
whether the island is in danger of tipping over under the tourists' weight.;  
 But Mexico will host the biggest share of travelers, partly because of its
easy access from the United States and partly since the eclipse will last
longest here: up to seven minutes, which is three more minutes than the
maximum length in Hawaii. This will also be the longest-lasting total eclipse
until 2132, according to Alan Dyer, an associate editor at Astronomy
magazine.;    The midday eclipse will consist of a 160-mile wide lunar shadow
speeding at up to 5,000 miles per hour along the Earth's surface.;    While
many Mexicans are looking forward to the event, some are quietly taking
precautions. In pre-Colombian times, eclipses were viewed as bad omens by the
sun-worshiping Aztecs.;    In the capital's Sonora market, specializing in
magic, vendors have stocked up on garlic bulbs tied with red ribbon, which
they hawk as protection from "the bad vibrations of the eclipse." A thriving
trade is also taking place in magnets, for those with low blood pressure to
carry in their pockets on July 11, and old copper coins for pregnant women to
place as charms in their belly buttons.;    As in Hawaii, Mexico could
probably use some otherworldly intervention to cope with the scores of
thousands of tourists who have already started arriving.;    In the southern
half of the Baja Peninsula, some hotels have had rooms reserved for more than
a year. All are now booked up, and authorities fear competition at campsites.;
   "We're worried that Californians will drive down on the spur of the moment,
without taking water or fuel," said Marivi Lerdo, who promotes tourism to
Mexico in New York.;    Although Hawaii's isolation will limit the size of the
crowds, locals are still predicting problems. "By God, there's just one road
on this island," a circle route that often narrows to two lanes, one shop
owner said. "It's going to be total insanity.";    "We're worrying that we
won't have enough alcohol and food on the island," said the manager of a local
restaurant and disco called The Eclipse, named by coincidence 10 years ago.;  
 While authorities fret over infrastructure capacity, many Californians are
preparing to revel in a New Age wonderland.;    "These are people who have
never, ever, missed a single episode of 'Star Trek,' " said Ken Stewart, who
is planning to lead a caravan of 50 enthusiasts from San Diego to Cabo San
Lucas, on the south tip of Baja.;    Mexico's government is heavily involved
in eclipse planning, having formed an Intersecretarial Commission for the
Eclipse, which, among other things, is supposed to oversee production of as
many as 60 million protective lenses. Newspapers here are carrying frequent
reminders not to stare directly at the sun.;    During the eclipse, the mystic
and the scientific will not be far apart.;    At six observatories atop
Hawaii's Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that is the highest peak in the Pacific,
solar researchers will turn their telescopes on the sun's outer atmosphere as
the moon covers the rest of the star.;    Twenty miles downhill, at The
Crystal Grotto in Honomu, Wendy Gilliam is selling pouches of three stones
called corona crystals and advising people to "expose them to the energy"
during the eclipse. "As the moon passes over the sun, there are certain power
vortexes here that are going to be opened up and awakened," she said.; DON'T
LOOK DIRECTLY AT IT; (box) If you want to watch the moon's progress across the
sun: Don't look at it. Staring at the sun during a partial eclipse could
quickly -- without your feeling a thing -- burn into your retina a permanent
image of the crescent sun, causing severe and permanent vision loss.;    (box)
It's safest to watch the eclipse indirectly by projecting the sun's image
through a pinhole and onto a sheet of white paper.;    (box) Other safe

<HEADLINE><HL>  LIGHTS OUT!
ECLIPSE WILL DIM DAYLIGHT HERE, LEAVE OTHERS
IN THE DARK  </HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>  It's a coincidence of cosmic proportions. The sun is 400 times wider than the
moon. But the sun also happens to be about 400 times as far away from Earth as
the moon.;    The result: From Earth both orbs look almost exactly the same
size. And when the moon's orbit happens to carry it directly across the face
of the sun, as it will Thursday, the effect is stunning -- a total solar
eclipse.  
        "It's maybe the greatest natural occurrence one can witness," said Larry
Toy, a Chabot College astronomy professor. "The phenomenon is just
awe-inspiring.";    Solar eclipses occur twice a year, when the sun, moon and
earth line up. (This line-up would occur at every new moon, except that the
moon's orbit is tilted so it only crosses the sun's path every six months.);  
 Because of variations in the moon's orbit, fewer than a third of the solar
eclipses are total eclipses. In these cases the moon's shadow, up to 200 miles
wide on the earth's surface, races west to east along the ground at 1,000 to
5,000 miles per hour for a few thousand miles.;    Most total eclipses get
little public attention. They occur over water, over the poles or in
difficult-to-reach terrain. On average, any point on Earth is eclipsed just
once every 360 years.;    But when the shadow's narrow path does cross
inhabited areas, people flock there to experience "totality" -- to watch the
light snap off and the stars snap on, and to gaze at the sun's shaggy corona
hanging in the dark sky for a few minutes before daylight abruptly returns.;  
 In the United States, the opportunity has come twice in the past couple of
decades -- along the East Coast in 1970 and across the Northwest and Northern
Plains in 1979.;    This Thursday the moon's shadow will be back for another
performance, one of the century's best.;    It's unusual for several reasons.
At its peak, observers will see one of the longest-lasting eclipses this
century -- six minutes, 53 seconds. Also, its 150-mile-wide path across
Hawaii, Baja California, Mexico City and four Central American capital cities
"puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history,"
says Alan Dyer, an editor of Astronomy magazine.;    Finally, since the center
of the shadow will pass right across the world's largest cluster of
astronomical observatories, the audience will include several dozen solar
scientists intent on getting the best view they've ever had.;    "It's going
to be great from up there on the mountain," said Harold Zirin, a California
Institute of Technology astronomer who will be at one of the observatories
atop Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that makes up a large piece of the island of
Hawaii.;    Historic events;  For science, two eclipses have proved especially
historic: In 1868, spectroscopic study of the sun's halo turned up evidence of
a new element, which was named helium, from Helios, the Greek sun god. And in
1919, astronomers spotted a star, which should have been behind the sun,
instead peeking around the edge of the sun. That was the first confirmation of
Albert Einstein's prediction that a star's gravity will bend the path of
light.;    But in recent years solar eclipses have declined in significance
for researchers.;    For one thing, chasing eclipses by trekking to remote
regions with delicate astronomical instruments to capture a few minutes of
data has lost much of its glamour, especially in times of tight budgets.;   
For another, some of the information now can be gathered any day of the year
by using instruments that simulate a solar eclipse.;    But this time, the
eclipse is coming to them, and they can't resist a look. At 13,800 feet, Mauna
Kea is the world's tallest island mountain. The air above it is still, dry and
clean, making it one of the world's choicest spots for viewing the cosmos.;   
It's so high that oxygen deprivation is a serious concern. And, unlike most
people headed for Hawaii, astronomers will be packing long underwear and down
jackets in case, as sometimes happens even in July, the temperature at the
summit drops below freezing.;    7 observatories in use;  Seven of the nine
observatories atop Mauna Kea will be used Thursday morning. (The Keck
Observatory, being built by the University of California and the California
Institute of Technology, is behind its original construction schedule and will
not be completed in time for the eclipse.);    What they want to know is more
about the temperature and composition of the sun's upper atmosphere -- layers
called the chromosphere and the corona -- which normally is difficult to
examine against the glare of the sun.;    They hope the information will
provide clues to what causes the sun's 11-year cycle of sunspots and flares
(now near its peak), what propels the solar wind and why the sun's outer
atmosphere is, paradoxically, so much hotter than its lower atmosphere.;   
Solar wind studies;  At some observatories, astronomers will take repeated
photographs of the corona during the eclipse to study it close up and to watch
for material accelerating outward to become solar wind.;    Others will use
telescopes to study the sun's emissions at microwave frequencies to learn more
details about how its temperature varies with altitude.;    But, frankly, the
astronomers also want to watch the lights go out.;    They'll be fighting the
temptation to abandon their instruments and go outside to watch.;    "The
biggest problem," Zirin said, "is whether we're going to see the eclipse."  </TEXT>

ECLIPSE WATCHERS SCRAMBLE FOR THEIR PLACE
IN THE SHADOW  </HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>  One by one the customers filtered out of the Orion Telescope Center, eclipsing
personal dignity in their zeal to view the sun through geeky,
fluorescent-green paper eyeshades.;    "It works: I see the sun," exclaimed
customer Jim Maurer as he peered at the Cupertino sky through his five-buck
Startrap Eclipse Viewers. "But I can't see anything else. . . . You know, I
don't think it's safe to drive in these."  
        Sure, he'll be able to see Thursday's solar eclipse. But, oh, if only he
and the hundreds of other customers could see themselves in the mirror,
looking like an audience for a 3-D horror flick.;    It appears from the way
people in the Golden State have been acting these days that they have been in
the sun too long. Actually, they can't wait to get into the shadow. Millions
of Californians will pause Thursday morning to join in an international
ritual: watching the longest-lasting solar eclipse until 2132.;    "What other
natural phenomenon can you be involved in and not get killed?" said Bert
Beecher, spokesman for the Minolta Planetarium at De Anza College. "It's a lot
safer than being in a volcano.";    Eyeshades a hot item;  Bay Area people
Tuesday were desperately seeking eyeshades. It took 24 hours for Orion
Telescope in Cupertino to sell its stock of 900 Eclipse Viewers, which are
made with Mylar plastic lenses and supposedly safe for eclipse viewing.
Welding supply stores were inundated with calls for welder's glasses made with
the same plastic.;    Local planetariums and observatories were deluged with
requests from people wanting to attend solar viewing sessions, even though the
Bay Area will be privy only to a partial eclipse -- 63 percent coverage of the
sun by the moon from 10:10 a.m. to 12:34 p.m.;    Some Bay Area "umbraphiles"
-- lovers of the shadow -- were leaving few details to chance.;    Flights
heavily booked;  Flights from here to Mexico and Hawaii -- where the eclipse
can be seen in total -- were heavily booked by sunstruck people spending
thousands of dollars to stand in 6 minutes, 53 seconds of darkness.;    Scott
Wiener, a computer company executive from Saratoga, is flying with two buddies
to Baja, where thousands will toast the corona with Coronas.;    "I figure
we'll get there in time to see the eclipse from a cab," said Wiener, who stood
in line at the telescope store Tuesday for the Eclipse Viewers. "We'll put on
the glasses and stick our heads out the window.;    "I figure it's worth it. I
don't know if I'll be around for the next one in 150 years."; WHERE TO WATCH;

'ECLIPSE OF MILLENNIUM' DAZZLES MILLIONS
DESPITE QUIRKS  </HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>  Shortly before 10:30 this morning California time, nature turned off the sun's
light switch and darkness over Hawaii and Mexico signaled the beginning of the
"The Eclipse of the Millennium.";    "Oh, my God," exclaimed one spectator
after another at a mountaintop observatory atop Mauna Kea as the sky went dark.  
        From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America, more than 40 million people saw
the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible. In
Hawaii, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in six years, stunning scientists
by releasing a dazzling fountain of lava at the height of the eclipse.;    And
in the Bay Area, more than half the sun was covered when the eclipse peaked at
11:20 a.m. The world will not see such a long-lasting eclipse for another 151
years.;    Few people who saw it today will forget "The Big One.";    "It
looks neat. It looks like someone took a bite out of an apple," said Matthew
Mauranoh, 8, of Mountain View, who peered through a homemade black box at the
Foothill Observatory.;    The view was diminished for many in Hawaii and
Mexico, where low cloud cover obscured the celestial display. In the
160-mile-wide swath from Hawaii to Baja to Mexico to Brazil, the morning
turned into night -- the only region where the eclipse made the Earth totally
dark.;    Clouds obscured eclipse;  As totality arrived at sea level on the
Big Island, the sun was hidden by a cloud layer. At the astronomy observatory
at the top of 13,800-foot Mauna Kea, high cirrus clouds thwarted three of the
10 scientific experiments.;    It still got dark, but the clouds disappointed
about 500 people gathered on the driving range at the Mauna Lani resort in
south Kohala. Their hopes had fallen and risen in the previous hour as the
clouds came and went.;    "I came especially for this, and hope we get to see
it," said Margaret MacLeod, a mathematics and science teacher from Manhattan
Beach shortly before the eclipse in Hawaii. "If we don't get to see it, I may
have to go to Iraq for the next one.";    Because of the clouds, most were
unable to see the stages of the eclipse until it got totally dark.;    In the
Bay Area, though, mostly sunny skies made eclipse watching a treat, except
along the coast, where it was obscured by fog.;    Parks, parking lots,
shopping centers, back yards and planetariums became Eclipsefests as the peak
approached.;    More than a hundred sun gazers showed up at the Branham Lane
Park in south San Jose with almost as many gizmos to help them spot sunspots
and watch the moon cross the sun.;    There were funny Mylar glasses, big
pinhole cameras, small pinhole cameras, welder's glass, welder's masks,
binoculars projecting images onto cardboard and telescopes.;    None was as
impressive as Ralph Reeves' interference birefrigent hydrogen alpha filter
telescope. All most of us need to know is that it takes electricity (provided
by a gas generator) to run. And that you can take pictures of the eclipse
through it. That is, if you have film.;    "I didn't bring any film with me,"
said Reeves, a retired Lockheed instrument builder. "Isn't that awful?";    At
the Children's Discovery Museum in downtown San Jose, hundreds of youngsters
and adults made cardboard telescopes, which projected the eclipse on white
cards through a needle hole opening.;    Paul Stonecipher , a discovery museum
staff guide, said, "We wanted to make little theaters for all of the kids to
see the eclipse without burning their eyes.";    Using mirrors, the eclipse
also was projected on the exterior walls of the lavendar-colored museum.;   
Eclipse theme park;  For nearly a week now, Hawaii turned into an eclipse
theme park. More than 500 astronomers and tens of thousands of amateurs
flocked to the islands to sell nearly everything under the sun.;    Sun-minded
entrepreneurs hawked eclipse T-shirts (60 different designs), hats, posters
and cookies. There was even an eclipse haircut and, of course, an eclipse
drink at the Eclipse restaurant in Kailua-Kona.;    "Everything is selling
pretty well except for the eclipse Frisbees. Nobody wants eclipse Frisbees,"
said "Wild Bill" Lawrence, who helped out at Moonshadows, one of many small
shops set up to  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE><HL>  STILL IN THE DARK ABOUT ECLIPSE? HERE'S WHAT
YOU NEED TO KNOW  </HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>  It's E-Day. But before you rush out to see whether the moon is blocking the
sun, here's a question-and-answer guide to today's eclipse.; Q What time is
the eclipse?  
     A Although television networks were pushing to have the eclipse in prime time,
nature refused to cooperate. In San Jose, the eclipse will begin at 10:10
a.m., peak at 11:20 a.m. and end at 12:34 p.m.; Q What is an eclipse?; A A
solar eclipse occurs when the Earth's moon moves into a position to impede the
sun's rays.; Q Can I look at the sun?; A No, a thousand times no. You'll burn
your retina, causing permanent damage. You shouldn't look at the sun through
film negatives, a camera viewfinder or sunglasses, either. So stand under a
tree and watch the shadows. Or punch a hole in a piece of paper and look
downward at the shadow.; Q Where can I get those goofy eclipse eyeshades?; A
Orion Telescope Center in Cupertino has sold out of the special glasses
designed for viewing the eclipse safely. A few welding supply stores offer
"Mylar" glasses. But some astronomers warn that there is no guarantee that
even these glasses will prevent eye damage.; Q Where is the best spot to
experience the eclipse?; A Contrary to popular belief, you will not get a
better sense of the eclipse on a mountaintop or from your roof. The major part
of the shadow will fall mostly through Mexico and Hawaii, where it will get
totally dark. The Bay Area gets cheated and will see the moon block only about
half the sun's diameter.; Q Can I still get to Baja or Hawaii in time?; A Most
flights to Baja are booked. And it's too late to make it to Hawaii. So you're
missing 2,000 golfers who will play a shadowy round there with balls that glow
in the dark.; Q Can overcast skies block the eclipse?; A In most parts of the
Bay Area, skies are expected to be sunny. But along the coast, the morning fog
is not likely to have cleared. The eclipse will still be visible through the
haze, astronomers say, and the shadows there may actually be more interesting
than in sunny San Jose. Again, don't stare at the sun, even through fog.; Q
Can children go outside?; A As long as they don't look at the sun.; Q Can I
sunbathe in the nude during the eclipse?; A As long as you don't open your
eyes.; Q When is the next major eclipse?; A In another 151 years. By then, you
may be able to shuttle to the moon and watch it from there.  </TEXT>
