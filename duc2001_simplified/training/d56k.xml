<HEADLINE><HL>Hormone Found in Diabetics May Play Role in Disease, Researcher
Says</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Further study of a newly isolated hormone found
in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the
most common form of the disease, a scientist says.
   ``We have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be, if not the
final cause, at least a major part of the disease process,'' said
New Zealand biochemist Garth Cooper.
   The research ``opens the door to the scientific study of the
disease at a level that wasn't possible before and potentially the
mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging,'' he said.
   Cooper, who has been working with scientists at Oxford
University, described the hormone research this week at the 13th
International Diabetes Federation Congress in Sydney, Australia.
   In his presentation, Cooper said the hormone, dubbed ``amylin,''
was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases
of diabetics.
   Amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulin
secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type
II diabetes, he said. Currently, obesity is considered a major
contributor to the disease rather than a result of it.
   Insulin normally controls the level of blood sugar. In Type II
diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body's
insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high.
   Complications can include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrene
that requires amputations.
   Type II diabetes afflicts the majority of the nation's estimated
11 million diabetics, according to the American Diabetes
Association. It often can be controlled through diet and exercise.
   Cooper said researchers hope to develop substances that block
amylin's secretion or action, opening the possibility of treatment.
He also said reseachers hope to develop a test to detect diabetes
very early in its development.
   The new work is ``a very important finding'' if amylin truly
blocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics, F.
Xavier Pi-Sunyer, an authority on Type II diabetes, said Friday.
   Scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks
insulin, but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics, said
Pi-Sunyer, director of the endocrinology, diabetes and nutrition
division at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Inside a small motor home, Joanne
Pierluissi raised her sleeve as nurse Mary Perez inserted a needle
into the vein above her forearm, drawing blood into a tube for a
diabetes test.
   As her daughters watched, Pierluissi, 24, said it was for them,
as much as for herself, that she agreed to be tested for the deadly
killer of Hispanics.
   ``I was concerned because they said an aunt of mine had it and I
just wanted to come for the checkup. All of our family is going to
go through the program to make sure that if we have it that we'll do
something about it.''
   Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes, but it is
most prevalent among minorities, especially Native Americans, blacks
and Hispanics. Hispanics are three times as likely to develop
diabetes as the general population, and 40 percent of the 700,000
victims in Texas are Mexican-American.
   More than 150,000 Americans die from diabetes each year; another
150,000 deaths are diabetes-related, according to the American
Diabetes Association.
   No one really knows what sparks it, but researchers believe
Hispanics could hold the key. San Antonio, the nation's ninth
largest city, with a population that is 50 percent Hispanic, is
becoming the base for diabetes studies.
   Researchers take a customized mobile home to neighborhoods to
randomly check Hispanics and Anglos for the disease, which deprives
the body of insulin and can lead to complications affecting the
heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves.
   San Antonio's Hispanic makeup led Dr. Ralph DeFronzo to abandon
his prestigious position as a Yale University diabetes researcher
and persuade his four-member team to relocate to the University of
Texas Health Science Center.
   An epidemiologist at the center, Dr. Michael Stern, has devoted
10 years to studying Hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study
of Type II diabetes.
   Type II, the most common form, develops mostly in obese adults
over 40 who also may have a family history of the disease. In obese
diabetics, the body has too much insulin because it is burning more
fats than sugars.
   Type I diabetes usually develops among adolescents and requires
that they have daily injections of insulin.
   Stern said family studies of diabetic patients are brining him
closer to finding the gene that triggers the disease.
   A genetic marker might identify people who are susceptible, which
could lead to a screening test, he said. ``Then you could go out and
zero in on the genetic susceptibles and you can be more intense on
your recommendations to them and you could also study that group.''
   Stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the
fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics,
fewer would get the disease.
   ``We use the term double jeopardy for Mexican-Americans,'' he
said. ``We don't know why, when they get diabetes, they have a more
severe form of the disease _ whether it's a biological difference or
is it that they are not getting as good medical care.
   ``But the interesting thing is that upper-income
Mexican-Americans do not have the same risk as low-income
Mexican-Americans. It may be that the gene is there, but for some
reason it may not be expressed in the upper-income Mexican-Americans.
   ``Also, Mexican-Americans tend to have more body fat in their
upper torso and we can see that as related to diabetes.''
   Between 1979 and 1988, Stern and his staff studied more than
5,000 people and found that 387 of 2,905 Hispanics had the disease,
or 13.3 percent, compared to only 87 of 1,780 Anglos, or 4.8 percent.
   Researchers believe that poor Hispanics' diets of cheap,
processed foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention _
either due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors _ increases
their risk of acquiring diabetes.
   The study is in its follow-up stage, to see if diagnosed diabetes
patients have changed their lifestyle and have sought medical care.
   Teresa Castro, 54, whose diabetic husband died at age 37, went
through the screening eight years ago. She was told that because of
her weight, 254 pounds, she had hypertension and was at risk of
diabetes. Doctors put her on a strict, low-fat diet and she lost 26
pounds.
   ``I went to the screening because they called and said it was
free. That's why I went to it, because being poor I couldn't afford
to go to the doctor for this type of checkup,'' she said. ``My
mother has diabetes and they tell me I might have diabetes, too, but
I don't know too much about it.
   ``I feel OK, but they tell me that one year you can be OK and the
next year, it can be totally different.''
   DeFronzo, who in 1988 was chosen the top diabetes investigator by
Canadian and Japanese diabetes associations, says his unit at the
Health Science Center will try to use many of Stern's patients for
research. That will include work for Lipha Chemicals, which makes an
anti-diabetic drug called metaforim that improves the body's ability
to respond to insulin.
   ``The problem with Type II diabetics is not that they don't make
enough insulin; they don't respond to the insulin,'' DeFronzo said.
``What we'd like to do is make them more responsive and this drug
will do that.''
   The drug is widely used in Europe, Canada and Mexico and should
be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in several years for
U.S. use, he said.
   Educating elementary-school-age children about healthy diets
would help reduce the number of diabetes cases, DeFronzo said. ``If
you have a 65-year-old mother who weighs 220 pounds and you tell her
to go out and jog five miles Monday, Wednesday and Friday, she is
going to laugh at you.
   ``So you have to design an exercise program that is compatible
with the patient's lifestyle and it is something they can do.''

<HEADLINE><HL>Researcher Developing Machinery To Braid Ceramic Fibers</HL></HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Aly El-Shiekh envisions astronauts on a
three-year trip to Mars ``knitting'' themselves a space station
using ceramic fibers that can be braided into panels, beams, boxes
and practically any other shape.
   ``We believe if they can take the ceramic fibers they need and
the machinery we're developing they would be able to literally make
the space stations they will need as they go,'' said El-Shiekh, a
mechanical engineer at working in North Carolina State University's
textiles school.
   El-Shiekh and his students are developing machinery to braid long
strands of ceramic fibers. Such fibers, bonded with epoxy, also will
form heat shields and many of the parts in the vessel that carries
people to Mars. The parts will withstand speeds of 50,000 mph and
temperatures of at least 4,000 degrees.
   While much of his work relates to the Mars Mission Research
Center here, El-Shiekh sees a big future for composite materials
like ceramic fibers.
   ``The day may very well come when you are driving around with car
engine parts of ceramic fiber,'' he said, adding that the
vibration-damping properties of the materials also would make them
good for torsion bars in cars.
   ``We also are working on the idea of putting this braided fabric
in concrete as reinforcing material instead of metal rods,'' he
said. ``It is stronger than steel, does not rust and would not wear
away _ the road would not deteriorate.''
   The fibers, including Kevlar now used to make bulletproof vests,
also could be used to make some body parts, and El-Shiekh is working
with Duke University researchers on ceramic ``stents,'' collapsible
braces for arteries.
   ``The possibilities are limitless.'' said El-Shiekh, who can
produce shapes ranging from hollow cubes to panels that have
openings for wiring and conduits already braided into them. ``The
big problem is cost and that's why we're working on this automated
machinery.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   It's 8 p.m. and a dozen people wait in the lobby of
Boston City Hospital's emergency room. Behind the swinging doors,
Dr. Peter Moyer is called to a car accident victim who has only
slight injuries but slips so deeply into unconsciousness he can
barely be roused by two physicians.
   ``Have you taken any drugs?'' doctors ask. ``Cocaine, heroin,
marijuana?''
   It's a question that has become more and more commonplace in
emergency rooms already burdened by increased patient loads.
   ``There is an emergency in the emergency room right now in not
only New York and Boston but around the country and for a variety of
reasons,'' said Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York
Hospital Association.
   Drugs, and their side effects of AIDS, violence and psychiatric
disorders, play a role in the problems plaguing big-city emergency
rooms, Raske said.
   From 1986 to 1987, according to the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, cocaine-related cases in emergency rooms increased 122
percent in the District of Columbia; 86 percent in both Boston and
Atlanta; 80 percent in Detroit; 73 percent in Chicago; 53 percent in
Minneapolis; 50 percent in Texas, and 39 percent in New York City.
   Efforts to stem the rising tide of drug abuse comes at a time
when emergency rooms already face increased patient loads, partly
because of the reduced role of the traditional family doctor and
partly because there are more people who can't afford a private
doctor.
   ``It's really providing a major backlog in the emergency
department system,'' said Diane Howard, director of the American
Hospital Association's division of ambulatory care and health
promotion.
   ``The bottom line is that emergency care is being squeezed,''
Raske said. ``The real loser here is the patient.''

SILENT KILLER: ONE IN EIGHT LATINOS HIT BY DISEASE 
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Consuelo wishes she could share her First Communion this year with Abuelita. 
She misses her grandmother very much. 
</P>
<P>
Abuelita was not very old -- just 62 -- but there was not much the doctors 
could do to save her life. She had uncontrolled diabetes: her kidneys were 
failing, her blood pressure was too high and she finally died of a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Consuelo and Abuelita aren't actual people, but their story nevertheless is 
played over and over again among the more than 3 million Latinos in the Los 
Angeles metropolitan area, health officials say. The reason is diabetes, a 
silent killer that afflicts one in eight Latino adults. This rate is higher 
than that of any ethnic group except for American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, it is estimated that there are more than 2 million Latinos who 
already have diabetes, many of them undiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the American Diabetes Assn. and other health education groups in 
the Los Angeles area and California have begun a major push to educate Latinos 
about diabetes. The effort is being aided by interested physicians and by drug 
companies, which make insulin and other drugs used for diabetes that can't be 
controlled by changes in eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
Like heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among Latinos is a 
condition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors 
say. Being 20% or more overweight is one of the major diabetes risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get into the communities and start teaching the kids and the 
adolescents and the parents to make some changes in their habits," said Dr. 
Jaime Davidson, a Dallas physician who has spearheaded the diabetes 
association's Latino education efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people think that when Latinos come here (to the United States) they gain 
weight because they continue to eat the way they ate at home. But in fact, they 
change," Davidson said. "What happens is, fast foods are readily available . . 
. and they are higher in fat and calories. And at home they didn't have a car, 
and here instead of walking we take the car to go one block. 
</P>
<P>
"That ends in having more obesity. If you have already a predisposed group of 
people, such as the Latinos, you get more obesity and you get more diabetes." 
</P>
<P>
With funding from Upjohn Co., the Los Angeles chapter of the American Diabetes 
Assn. sponsored a diabetes health fair at Olvera Street Plaza on Aug. 26. Of 
3,000 who attended the fair, 1,000 underwent tests for diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
More of this kind of effort and wider education among the public and physicians 
can be expected in the future, said Janet Matkin, of the association's 
California affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Diabetes is a defect in the body's system for using sugar in the blood. It 
results from the body's failure to make insulin or, some studies indicate, from 
its inability to use insulin that is available. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are Anglos, and 
incidence of the disease increases with age. In one survey done in San Antonio, 
a third of the Latinos between the ages of 55 and 65 had diabetes, Davidson 
said. Latinos' higher susceptibility is thought to result from a combination of 
both heredity and diet. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, American Indians have the highest diabetes incidence of any ethnic 
group in the United States. Genetically controlled defects in the body's 
insulin system are also thought to exist both for them and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Latino diets can be rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote 
obesity and increase the chance of getting diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
Diabetes that begins in childhood requires daily insulin injections. Most 
commonly in Latinos, however, diabetes takes the form called Type II, which 
first appears in adulthood and often can be controlled with proper diet and 
exercise. The disease tends to show up in the late 20s and early 30s among 
Latinos, a decade earlier than it does in Anglos, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
But, because it progresses slowly, Type II diabetes can go undiagnosed for 
years, allowing complications such as kidney failure, heart disease, blindness 
and the need for amputation of a foot or toe. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, who often have less access to regular health care than Anglos, are 
more likely to go undiagnosed, Matkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The new educational efforts to change that picture are necessary, not only 
because they help individuals stay healthy but also because the nation's health 
care funding crisis will only get worse if the problem is not reduced, Davidson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a problem that is going to grow, maybe at epidemic proportions," 
Davidson said. "In some states like California or Texas, if nothing is done 
we're going to pay so much money for health care for people of Latino origin 
that it may become prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
The number of Latino diabetics in the United States will nearly quadruple by 
the year 2000 to 8 million, according to projections by Eli Lilly Co. Caring 
for them will cost more than $10 billion a year, even if the disease has no 
complications, the company projects. 
</P>
<P>
Yet life-style changes today to cut down on obesity can prevent many of those 
cases from ever occurring, health officials say. That means adapting an 
Anglo-oriented health education network to the needs of a diverse Latino 
community that has a different social structure, health beliefs and eating 
habits from the majority culture. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the fact that Type II diabetes frequently shows up in women 
during or shortly after pregnancy gives health educators an ideal chance to 
influence an entire Latino family's eating habits, said Dr. Martin Montoro, 
co-director of the diabetes and pregnancy service at Los Angeles County-USC 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Any Latino woman whose child was born at 9 pounds or larger should consider 
herself at risk of diabetes and alter her diet, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
Recent immigrants and even some longtime U.S. residents are not likely to want 
to switch completely away from a diet reliant on beans, tortillas and other 
carbohydrates, Montoro noted, but modifications can be made easily. One of the 
most important is to cut down on fat in the diet by eliminating fried foods -- 
for instance, by not frying tortillas for tacos or enchiladas. 
</P>
<P>
Other barriers to Latinos getting care for diabetes are more subtle, doctors 
interested in the issue say. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among these is that the Latino patient is less likely to volunteer 
information or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the Anglo patient, said 
Dr. Aliza Lifshitz, a board member of the California Hispanic American Medical 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Any physician practicing in Southern California needs to be aware of that and 
to learn to ask more diabetes-related questions of their Latino patients, 
Lifshitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson said he is confident that Latinos will respond to education efforts on 
diabetes. He pointed to the recent indications that Americans' risk of heart 
disease is lowering as examples of how educational programs can work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if we give them the opportunity and the tools that Latinos are no 
different than anybody else," Davidson said. "We need to give them the 
opportunity to enter the health care system, and we need to give them the 
opportunity to learn that diabetes is the biggest health care issue that they 
are going to face into the year 2000."

<HEADLINE><HL>  CLASS COMBATS DIABETES FROM HISPANIC COOKING  </HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>  You can have your tamale and eat it too, says Rachel Torres, diabetes educator
at San Jose Hospital and coordinator of the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara
Valley's Hispanic Education Program.;    The secret to eating Mexican and
other Hispanic foods while still maintaining a healthy diet is in the
preparation of the food, she said.  
        Beginning this summer, Torres and other health professionals will be
offering nutrition and exercise classes geared toward Hispanics in an effort
to educate them on the dangers of diabetes.;    According to state Health
Department statistics, the incidence of diabetes in the Hispanic population is
three times that of the general population. Health experts believe the
Hispanic diet and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors.;    "Our
food is one of the richest in terms of taste and nutrition," said Torres. "But
it's the way we prepare the food that messes things up for us.";    In her
classes, Torres said she will instruct her students to prepare tamales,
refried beans and other traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil
rather than the more traditional recipes that call for the use of lard. And
instead of eating four tortillas at one sitting, she recommends they be eaten
throughout the day.;    Although courses for Hispanic diabetics and their
families have been offered by the Diabetic Society for almost three years,
lessons on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise to combat the disease
will be offered for the first time.;    Sue Ann Kelly, education director for
the Diabetes Society, said the classes may be the first ones ever geared
specifically toward the Hispanic lifestyle.;    "It's a powerful feeling our
educators get when they discover all the cultural issues that come in to play
when dealing with diabetes," she said.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The next course
for Hispanic diabetics and their families will be 9 a.m. to noon Saturday at
Alexian Brother's Hospital, 225 N. Jackson Ave. Registration will begin at
8:30 a.m. Classes are free. For more information, call (408) 287-3785. For
those who can't make it to class, the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara County
offers the bilingual booklet, "Comer Bien Para Vivir Mejor," a seven-day
Mexican food menu for diabetics as well as those who want to eat healthy.  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE><HL>  HOW TO MANAGE DIABETES
FREE CLINIC FOR HISPANICS WILL FOCUS ON DIET,
EXERCISE, MEDICATION  </HL></HEADLINE>
<TEXT>  Hispanics, whose incidence of diabetes is two to three times as high as the
population of the United States as a whole, can learn how to manage the
illness at a free half-day clinic Saturday at St. Louise Health Center in
Morgan Hill.;    Heredity and diet appear to be the major reasons that 14 to
21 percent of Hispanics -- and up to 40 percent in the 64 to 75 age group --
contract diabetes, said Rochelle McNamara, executive director of the Diabetes
Society of Santa Clara Valley.  
        About 7 percent of the general population has diabetes, McNamara said.;   
Hispanics who have strong American Indian ancestry may be vulnerable to
diabetes because about 50 percent of all Indians develop diabetes, McNamara
said. Also, the high-fat diet of many Hispanics leads to obesity, which seems
to trigger diabetes, McNamara said.;    Eighty percent of Hispanics over 40
who are diagnosed as diabetic are overweight, she said.;    The clinic
Saturday will focus on three ways to manage diabetes -- diet, exercise and
medication. Participants will learn that traditional dishes can be just as
tasty -- but healthier -- when made with unsaturated fats, and that exercise
will reduce weight, which in turn will lower the possibility of contracting
diabetes.;    "There is no magic pill to cure diabetes. You have to manage
your own diabetes, and we're teaching people how to take care of themselves,"
McNamara said.;    The hospital and the diabetes society are sponsoring
neighborhood diabetes programs for Hispanics, which are taught by bilingual
instructors.;    The programs, which first began in 1984, are aimed at people
who speak only Spanish or people who are more comfortable receiving
instruction in that language.;    "We found that the regular programs that we
started years ago were not reaching the monolingual Spanish-speaker," McNamara
said.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The diabetes management program for Hispanics
will be from 9 a.m. to noon at St. Louise Health Center, 18500 St. Louise
Drive, off Cochrane Road in Morgan Hill. Registration begins at 8:30 a.m.
