<HEADLINE><HL>Elizabeth Taylor, Hospitalized With Pneumonia, in Stable Condition</HL></HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Actress Elizabeth Taylor,
hospitalized with pneumonia, was listed as stable Thursday at St.
John's Hospital and Health Center, her publicist said.
   ``She's stable. She's OK. We have nothing else,'' said Lisa Del
Favaro, a Taylor spokeswoman with Chen Sam and Associates public
relations in New York City. Inquiries to the hospital were referred
to Chen Sam.
   Miss Taylor, 58, hospitalized with a sinus infection April 9 at
Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, was transferred to St. John's on
Monday because of a persistent fever and pneumonia.
   ``She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics
and will remain hospitalized,'' Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious
disease specialist treating Miss Taylor, said in a statement
Tuesday.
   Miss Taylor said in the statement: ``I have been advised by my
physician to remain hospitalized and I expect to make a full
recovery.''
   The actress had a nearly fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, the
year she won an Oscar for ``Butterfield 8.'' Doctors performed a
tracheotomy _ inserting an air tube in her windpipe at the neck _
to help her breathe.
   Miss Taylor's health problems started with a fall from a horse
when she was 13 and filming the movie ``National Velvet.'' She has
had back problems ever since.
   In 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills
and pain killers prescribed for a wide range of health problems.
Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse at the
Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage.

<TEXT>
   A seriously ill Elizabeth Taylor
battled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by a
ventilator, doctors say.
   Hospital officials described her condition late Monday as
stabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the
pneumonia. Analysis of the tissue sample was expected to take until
Thursday, said her spokeswoman, Chen Sam.
   The 58-year-old actress, who won best-actress Oscars for
``Butterfield 8'' and ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' has been
hospitalized more than two weeks. She was in the intensive care
unit at St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
   ``She is seriously ill,'' her doctors said in a statement.
``After surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by a
ventilator. Her condition is presently stabilizing and her
physicians are pleased with her progress.''
   Another spokewoman for the actress, Lisa Del Favaro, said Miss
Taylor's family was at her bedside. She did not identify the family
members.
   Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9
with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said. Her
condition worsened and she was transferred April 16 to St. John's
and moved into intensive care on Friday.
   ``It is serious, but they are really pleased with her progress.
She's not well. She's not on her deathbed or anything,'' Ms. Sam
said late Monday.
   While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator,
it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G.
Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert who
emphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition.
   Doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restore
oxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathing
difficulties have reduced those levels, Mohler said.
   ``It may be that because she is such a prominent person, they
are taking a conservative course,'' he added.
   Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,
particularly back troubles from filming of ``National Velvet' in
1945, when she fell off a horse.
   In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills
and painkillers. Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug
abuse at the Betty Ford Clinic.
   During a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, Miss Taylor
underwent a tracheotomy, an incision into her windpipe to help her
breathe. She appeared at the 1961 Academy Awards with a bandage
over her scar as she accepted the ``Butterfield 8'' Oscar.

<HEADLINE><HL>Doctors Say Liz Taylor Nearly Died Over the Weekend</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Elizabeth Taylor has rallied from a
near-fatal bout with pneumonia _ and even joked about coming out in
her ``balcony attire'' to wave to reporters _ but is ``not out of
the woods,'' doctors say.
   ``I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and I
believe that has now passed,'' Dr. Bernard Weintraub, a lung
specialist treating Miss Taylor at St. Johns Hospital and Health
Center, said Wednesday.
   The 58-year-old actress was taken off the ventilator that had
aided her breathing for several days and was smiling again and
``very happy the tube was out,'' said Dr. Patricia Murray, an
infectious disease specialist.
   ``She said she'd come out and wave to you but she's not in her
balcony attire,'' the doctor said.
   About 80 reporters and camera crew members, along with some 100
St. Johns employees, jammed the hospital courtyard to hear the
latest reports on Miss Taylor.
   Miss Taylor has had back troubles since she fell off a horse
during filming in 1945 of ``National Velvet.'' She had to undergo a
tracheotomy during a bout with pneumonia in 1961 that nearly killed
her.
   In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills
and painkillers, and her weight has been up and down over the years.
   In response to persistent rumors about AIDS and other illnesses,
Weintraub said there was ``no suggestion of either cancer or
infections commonly seen in AIDS.'' The actress had issued a
statement earlier denying she has AIDS.
   Weintraub said the actress, hospitalized since April 9, remained
in intensive care.
   ``She is in serious condition. She is not out of the woods,'' he
said.
   With her were her four children from three marriages, Maria
Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and Michael Wilding.
   The hospital released a statement on Miss Taylor's behalf
thanking fans and friends for their cards and letters.

<HEADLINE><HL>Elizabeth Taylor Suffers Complications, Six More Weeks in Hospital</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Elizabeth Taylor suffered
complications including new infections in her fifth week of
hospitalization for pneumonia, and will remain hospitalized for
about six more weeks, doctors said Friday.
   The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with viral
pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast
infection, her doctors said.
   During the next 1{ months, she will require intravenous therapy
in the hospital, they said in a statement released by St. John's
Hospital and Health Center.
   Bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than
the viral pneumonia Miss Taylor initially contracted. That's
because antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses.
   ``She is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctors
are pleased with her progress,'' Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam,
said after talking to doctors.
   Hospital spokeswoman Paulette Weir said she couldn't go beyond
the statement. Miss Taylor was still in a private room and not the
intensive care unit, she said.
   Earlier this week, Ms. Sam said the 58-year-old actress was
improving and would be released from the hospital this week to
recuperate at home.
   During a news conference last month, Miss Taylor's doctors
revealed she was near death on April 22.
   The Oscar-winning star of ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
and ``Butterfield 8'' entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on
April 9 with a sinus infection, but her condition deteriorated and
she was moved to St. John's for treatment of viral pneumonia.
   Miss Taylor was reportedly in one of the hospital's suites.
   Suites are ``like a small hotel room with a sitting room, a
living room area,'' Weir said without confirming whether the
actress was in a suite.
   Visitors throughout Miss Taylor's hospitalization included her
four children, Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher
and Michael Wilding. Entertainer Michael Jackson also paid a visit.

   Elizabeth Taylor will remain in the
hospital six more weeks due to complications in her fifth week of
treatment for pneumonia, doctors said.
   The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with viral
pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast
infection, her doctors said Friday.
   ``This secondary bacterial pneumonia often follows viral
pneumonia. Her condition is listed as stable and she is improving
significantly,'' they said in a statement released by St. John's

<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined Friday to press 
charges against several physicians, ending its investigation into allegations 
that they over-prescribed painkillers to actress Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
In a written report, the district attorney's office said the prescribing 
practices "fell below the accepted standard of medical practice," but added 
that the doctors "were also attempting to deal with her addiction through 
alternative means of therapy and treatment, and . . . their conduct was devoid 
of criminal intent." 
</P>
<P>
The report said one of the physicians repeatedly tried to persuade her to enter 
a rehabilitation clinic but "these efforts to intervene were strongly resisted 
by Ms. Taylor until October, 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 58, acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and painkillers 
and has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse at the Betty Ford Clinic in 
Rancho Mirage.

LIZ TAYLOR PUT ON VENTILATOR AFTER BIOPSY FOR PNEUMONIA 
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the assistance of a ventilator after 
undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept 
her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy Award-winning actress was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Santa 
Monica last week for treatment of the pneumonia, and was listed in serious 
condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit on Monday, her doctors said in 
a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"She is seriously ill and on Sunday underwent a lung biopsy to further 
determine the cause of her pneumonia," the physicians' statement said. "After 
surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
"Her condition is presently stabilizing, and her physicians are pleased with 
her progress." 
</P>
<P>
The statement provided no additional details of Taylor's condition, and 
hospital officials declined to comment beyond the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa del Favero, a New York City publicist for Taylor, said the actress is 
"seriously ill, but she's not on her deathbed. We're not talking about anything 
terminal." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's doctors expect to have results of the biopsy by Thursday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Del Favero said Taylor's four children -- Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey 
and Christopher and Michael Wilding -- were with her at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a biopsy on the actress is called Sutton's law in medicine, after 
legendary holdup man Willie (the Actor) Sutton who said he robbed banks 
"because that's where the money is," said Dr. John G. Mohler, a pulmonary 
disease specialist at the USC School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't know what the trouble is, you grab a biopsy and study it, because 
that's where the problem is," Mohler explained. "The problem is not easily 
found another way. 
</P>
<P>
"You study the biopsy because that will dictate your therapy. If they (took a 
biopsy), I'm sure she was not responding to antibiotics." 
</P>
<P>
Mohler said Taylor's doctors are taking a prudent course by placing her on a 
ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered a near-fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, and Mohler said "it would 
seem that there is something basically wrong with her lung structure or 
function. When she gets pneumonia, apparently it's more severe." 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that he has no personal familiarity with the actress's case, Mohler 
said he does not "blame her doctors for being conservative. Placing her on a 
ventilator would be a prudent and conservative thing to do, even if she didn't 
have any difficulty. It may just be a precautionary step in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 58, entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey on April 
10 suffering what her publicist then described as a "severe sinus infection." 
She was transferred to St. John's April 16 when her condition worsened. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist, said in a statement last 
week that Taylor had pneumonia and was "being treated intravenously with 
antibiotics and will remain hospitalized (indefinitely)." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years, particularly recurring 
back troubles that began with a fall from a horse during filming of the 1945 
movie "National Velvet." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and painkillers 
prescribed for a wide range of health problems. Taylor has been treated for 
alcohol and drug abuse problems at the Betty Ford Clinic.

<HEADLINE><HL>
LIZ BIZ; 
THROUGH SICK AND THIN, THE WORLD WATCHES TAYLOR 
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Her movies now are few and far between, but when she is ill, the world still 
stands at attention. Liz Taylor's latest bout with pneumonia has drawn the kind 
of intense scrutiny normally accorded presidential polyps. It has inspired a 
raft of rumors and handed up a field day for the giddy tabloids. And today, yet 
again, everyone is talking about La Liz. 
</P>
<P>
But then Liz Taylor, 58, has always lived a life of extremes. If she has 
enjoyed the most brilliant career and the glare of fame, she has also survived 
seven rocky marriages to six men, the frailest health and the most frightening 
bouts with addiction to booze, drugs and food. And through it all, there have 
been armies of press recording each divorce, each hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
It was partly to still the gossips that Taylor's doctors called a press 
conference Wednesday at St. John's Hospital and Medical Center in Santa Monica. 
No AIDS, they said. No cancer. For the tabloid press had been humming with 
rumors that Liz Taylor had AIDS virtually since she was checked into Daniel 
Freeman Hospital in Marina del Rey April 9 with a high fever and sinus 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
And when Taylor's publicists first issued flat denials, the press went on to 
speculate about the speculation. Did the AIDS rumors start because of Taylor's 
ballyhooed friendship with publishing titan Malcolm Forbes, whose recent death 
touched off reports about his alleged homosexuality? Or was it because of her 
reputation as a major fund-raiser for the disease? Or because one of her 
doctors, Michael Roth, was a renowned AIDS specialist -- even though Roth was 
supervising her treatment for drug and alcohol addiction as early as 1983? 
</P>
<P>
"Liz is a national treasure and when she entered the hospital, I thought it was 
as important as the President of the U.S. going in and we treated it as such. 
Liz is as close to American royalty as you can have, and our readers . . . in 
the heartland . . . they're living and dying with her," said Barry Levine, 
Hollywood bureau chief of the Star, which featured a cover photograph of Liz, 
hooked up to an intravenous tube and oxygen mask, being transferred from the 
Marina del Rey hospital to St. John's. Levine declined comment on a rumor 
circulating among reporters that the tabloid had paid $50,000 for the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Some press coverage has bent over backwards to tug at the bounds of 
credibility; the National Enquirer has Liz communing with the ghosts of Forbes 
and one-time husband Richard Burton. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Liz's current illness has drawn the most attention yet, according to 
her publicist, Chen Sam. More than 100 reporters, photographers and cameramen 
converged on St. John's, many of whom had flown in from around the country for 
the 15-minute press conference. Behind a chorus line of video cameras -- 
representing the major networks, the local stations, CNN and the tabloid shows 
-- reporters peppered the doctors with pointed and sometimes testy questions 
about Taylor's treatment and drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard some guys talking behind me, saying, 'I can't believe they're hounding 
her like this.' I felt like saying, 'Are you offended reading about her?' " 
sniffed Val Richardson, a reporter from the Washington Times who'd flown in 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the news was good. Taylor was off a respirator and breathing with 
the help of an oxygen mask. She had apparently rebounded from a bad weekend, 
when doctors feared she might die. Although Taylor's physicians are still 
trying to identify the virus, they are treating her for pneumonia with 
antibiotics. And she remains in the intensive-care unit, but she continues to 
improve and is expected to move to a regular room this weekend, Sam said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her own security guards keep watch over her private room in 
intensive care. She has received her four children -- Christopher and Michael 
Wilding, Maria Burton-Carson and Liza Todd-Tivey -- friends Roddy McDowall and 
Carole Bayer Sager and Liz's younger, ex-trucker boyfriend, Larry Lee 
Fortensky, 38. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw her yesterday and I was really pleased," Sager said Wednesday. "I 
thought her color was good. She couldn't speak because she had the respirator. 
Her eyes were clear and she definitely understood what I said and motioned, 
made me know she understood." 
</P>
<P>
If Liz's public is fascinated by her frailties, perhaps reassured somehow by 
the knowledge that even the gods are vulnerable, their interest is also piqued 
by the public face she puts on her relentless brushes with illness and 
addiction. The Taylor wit shone through even Wednesday's press conference, when 
doctors passed on the actress' desire to "come out and wave at you, but she 
wasn't in her balcony attire." "I think she's extraordinarily brave," Sager 
said. "She just has an enormous reservoir of inner strength that she calls on 
when she has to. All of us were encouraged and optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
She has needed it. Taylor's respiratory ailments alone have been a recurring 
problem. Bronchitis and laryngitis brought down the curtain on numerous 
performances of "The Little Foxes," which Taylor starred in on Broadway in 
1981, and Noel Coward's "Private Lives," which toured the country in 1983. The 
cancellations prompted the play's co-producer, Zev Bufman, to declare, 
"Bronchitis has plagued Elizabeth all her life." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Taylor has been plagued by health woes ever since her 1945 film debut 
in "National Velvet"; her fall from a horse triggered a lifetime of back 
trouble. And when Taylor retired from films to marry the Republican senator 
from Virginia, John Warner, her well-being continued to make headlines; she 
choked on a chicken bone and wrenched her back after slipping on a carpet at a 
reception honoring former President Gerald R. Ford. Over the years she has 
endured about 20 major operations on her back, appendix, eyes and teeth; when 
the Asian flu threatened Taylor's life, doctors made a hole in her throat so 
she could breathe. 
</P>
<P>
But it has been her wrestling matches with weight and addiction that have 
consistently lured the world's curiosity and, at times, admiration. Taylor's 
unhappy stint as a politician's wife prompted her weight to balloon to 180 
pounds. When she emerged a born-again beauty in 1985 after shedding 60 pounds, 
and wrote a beauty book to boot, she was applauded by many -- including 
comedian Joan Rivers, who had made fat-Liz jokes the mainstay of her act. 
</P>
<P>
"For somebody like me who is obsessive, it's amazing I was never a gambler," 
she said at the time. "I could have become anorexic. I got to a size 4 and 
said, 'Why not a size 2?' Then I slapped myself and went from 118 to 122, which 
is the right weight for me." 
</P>
<P>
But her battles against addiction have played havoc with her fight against the 
bulge. And her persistent back problems have nurtured her dependence on pills. 
Her addictions have even been linked to a criminal investigation by the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office; last week, prosecutors announced 
that no charges would be filed against Taylor's doctors, who had been accused 
of over-prescribing dependence-forming drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, the first celebrity known to enter the Betty Ford clinic in Rancho 
Mirage, made a public example of her willingness to take on her addictions in 
two heavily publicized stays there. 
</P>
<P>
When Taylor first checked in, in 1983, she admitted to 35 years of addiction to 
pain killers and sleeping pills. She kept a diary that poignantly described 
that stay as "probably the first time since I was 9 that nobody's wanted to 
exploit me. Now the bad news. I feel like hell. I'm going through withdrawal. 
My heart feels big and pounding. I can feel the blood rush through my body. I 
can almost see it, running like red water over the boulders in my pain-filled 
neck and shoulders, then through my ears and into my pounding head. My eyelids 
flutter. Oh God, I am so, so tired." 
</P>
<P>
But the Betty Ford clinic encouraged Taylor only to fight the good fights that 
had brought her there, rather than take on all addictions -- to drugs and food 
-- at once. And the late '80s had found Liz, hobbled by back pain, returning to 
those two sources of comfort. Taylor regained much of the weight, even though 
she took her drug problems in hand once again in a second stay at the Betty 
Ford clinic in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But through her ordeals, she has remained the same charmingly vain Liz who once 
declared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels. She never budged from her room 
at Betty Ford without her trademark darkened eyebrows. And even when she was 
ambushed recently by a Star photographer, Liz couldn't help being, well, Liz. 
</P>
<P>
Says the Star's Levine: "No matter how sick she was, when someone down on the 
ground told her she was being photographed, she put on sunglasses, even though 
she had an IV in her arm, as if to cover herself up. Typical Liz Taylor. It was 
sad and sweet, at the same time."

<P>
Pneumonia-stricken actress Elizabeth Taylor has suffered complications in her 
fifth week of hospitalization, including new infections, and doctors now say 
she will be hospitalized six more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with a viral pneumonia, 
has been complicated by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection, her doctors 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Taylor has a resolving, newly acquired bacterial pneumonia secondary to 
her hospital stay at St. John's Hospital and Health Center," the doctors said 
in Santa Monica through Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam. 
</P>
<P>
"It is improving significantly," the physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
"She has also developed a fungemia of Candida albicans (infection in the 
blood), more commonly referred to as yeast and will be hospitalized for 
approximately six more weeks for intravenous therapy," the doctors added 
without elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
Bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than the viral 
pneumonia Taylor initially contracted because antibiotics are effective against 
bacteria but not viruses.

   Settle Actress's Lawsuit

<TEXT>
   NEW YORK -- Actress Elizabeth Taylor and the National
Enquirer said they reached a settlement of Miss Taylor's
lawsuit against the newspaper tabloid.
   Terms weren't disclosed. The paper said it made "an
appropriate monetary payment" to Miss Taylor and apologized
to her.

   
   The lawsuit, which has been pending for nine months, arose
out of two articles published by the Enquirer in June 1990
reporting on Miss Taylor's condition and activities at St.
John's Hospital, Santa Monica, Calif., where she was treated
last spring for pneumonia.
   The Enquirer said that after gaining access to all of Miss
Taylor's medical records, it is satisfied that the articles
reporting on the actress's medical condition and the report
that she was drinking were in error. The paper said it
published the articles in good faith reliance on information
provided to it, but the information was inaccurate. Iain
Calder, Enquirer editor, said in a statement, "we regret the
inaccuracies in the articles but are pleased that this
dispute has come to an amicable end."
   Miss Taylor said she feels "completely vindicated," and
that after the newspaper's management determined the articles
were in error, the Enquirer "acted promptly and in good
faith."
   Miss Taylor initially sought damages of $20 million in Los
Angeles Superior Court, according to Neil Papiano, her
attorney. Although Mr. Papiano wouldn't specify the size of
the settlement, he said "we were persuaded that it was
certainly large enough that we shouldn't go to trial."
   As previously reported, G.P. Group Inc., the Lantana,
Fla., publisher of the Enquirer and Star tabloids, plans to
raise $350 million by offering 43% of the firm in an initial
