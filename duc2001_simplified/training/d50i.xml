<HEADLINE><HL>When It Comes to Drought, USDA Says It's in Action</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says it has been on
top of the drought since March 1, monitoring the situation, setting
up hotlines to handle worried callers and issuing enough statements
to paper a thousand bird cages, easy.
   One of the latest informational gimmicks is a ``USDA
Backgrounder'' listing the department's ``drought-related actions''
since the blotter-like furnaces began roaring across most of the
nation.
   ``It was my idea, my memory isn't what it used to be,'' quipped
Sally Michael, the department's deputy director of information.
``This helps me keep track of what we've done.''
   Michael agreed during questioning by a reporter that the action
list is lean on actual dollars going into the drought aid. Only two
items had dollar amounts. One involved meat purchases for school
cafeterias and the other a credit deal for the sale of meat to
Mexico.
   The backgrounders will be updated every two weeks. The first
lists 22 separate drought ``actions'' by USDA or its people,
beginning more than four months ago.
   First item:
   ``March 1. Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng establishes
USDA Drought Task Force under the chairmanship of Deputy Secretary
Peter C. Myers. Members _ agency administrators and key USDA
personnel _ will constantly monitor the potential drought
situation.''
   The blurb also gave the number of the USDA press release that
formally announced the task force creation, but not its date. In
reality, though the drought panel was set up by Lyng on March 1,
the press release announcing the action was not issued until April
22.
   Department officials questioned at the time said they attached
no significance to keeping the task force secret for seven weeks
before announcing it.
   Excerpts from other USDA actions cited by the report:
   _May 31. Counties found to be suffering from drought will be
allowed emergency haying and grazing of Acreage Conservation
Reserve (ACR) and Conservation Use Acreage (CUA). At this time,
haying and grazing do not apply to Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP) acreage.
   _June 9. Standing hay on farms held in inventory (taken over) by
the Farmers Home Administration can be sold at a reasonable cost to
help feed livestock in drought counties where state offices of the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service have authorized
release of set-aside acres for haying and grazing.
   _June 14. Lyng briefs Senate and House Agriculture Committees on
the drought and offers to cooperate with the Congressional Relief
Task Force announced by Sen. Patrich Leahy, D-Vt., and Rep. Kika de
la Garza, D-Texas.
   _June 15. The White House announces a new Interagency Drought
Policy Committee made up of USDA, Interior, the Office of the Vice
President and several other agencies. Departments of State and
Transportation, and the Council of Economic Advisers were
subsequently added.
   _June 16. Lyng announces that farmers in designated drought
counties will be authorized to harvest hay from land in the
Conservation Reserve Program. Haying will be allowed for 30 days if
farmers give up part of their CRP payments. Livestock grazing of
CRP land was not authorized.
   _June 20. The Interagency Drought Policy Committee meets for the
first time.
   _June 20. USDA begins making daily audio tapes of weather
updates available to news media.
   _June 21. Lyng announces haying will be allowed on CRP land if a
county has been approved for emergency haying and grazing of ACR
and CUA land due to drought.
   _June 22. Lyng meets with the Congressional Drought Relief Task
Force, which issues a ``statement of general agreements'' calling
on the secretary to implement various forms of disaster assistance.
   _June 23. Lyng and other USDA officials meet in Chicago with the
National Governors' Association Committee on Agriculture and Rural
Development.
   _June 23. While in Chicago, Lyng announces a toll-free hotline
to answer questions about federal services available in drought
areas.
   _June 23. Returning to Washington, Lyng briefs the president and
vice president on the drought and says that there is agreement
among congressmen, senators, farm groups and governors that it is
too early for emergency relief measures.
   _June 23. After the White House meeting, the Interagency Drought
Policy Committee meets for the second time at USDA.
   _June 24. In its first day of operation, USDA's hotline logs
more than 600 calls in 10 hours. Lyng orders another eight lines
installed, raising total to 18 lines. Greatest number of calls the
first day are from Iowa, Wisconsin and North Dakota.
   _June 27. USDA announces that special crop surveys in several
states and other steps will be taken to update the department's
July 12 crop report and supply-and-demand projections for fall
harvets, including corn and soybeans.
   _June 27. An additional $50 million has been set aside to buy
bulk ground beef for donation to schools lunch and other feeding
programs, to help cattle producers hurt by drought.
   _June 27. Lyng authorizes additional emergency provisions in
drought counties, including permission for selling hay to anyone,
and the harvest of ACR, CUA and CRP land as green chop for
immediate feeding to livestock or silage.
   _June 27. Intragency Drought Policy Committee meets for the
third time.
   _June 28. Federal and state officials set up a national hay
information network, or HayNet, to assist in locating forage
supplies.
   _June 29. Department will hold news conference July 12 following
release of crop report and supply-demand projections.
   _June 29. Mexico can buy $40 million worth of meat under an
amended credit arrangement. The purchases are intended to help
bolster livestock markets depressed by drought liquidation of herds.

<HEADLINE><HL>Drought Shifts East, Little Relief in Sight</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   The focus of the drought plaguing much of the
nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most
areas, the National Weather Service reported Thursday.
   The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot,
dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the Ohio
Valley to the Mid-Atlantic states.
   Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts
along the U.S.-Canadian border, possibly triggering scattered
showers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley. The heavy rain which has hit portions of Texas is expected
to diminish.
   Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the Great
Lakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency's
Climate Analysis Center reported.
   In addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the
northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.
   A 30-day weather forecast issued Wednesday held little hope for
improvement. And a separate climate assessment added that many
areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent
chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.
   At the beginning of July, 29 percent of the nation was
undergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said.
   On Tuesday, the Agriculture Department announced sharp
reductions in the anticipated harvest of many crops because of the
water shortage _ and those projections were based on the assumption
of normal weather from here on, according to department officials.
   The new National Weather Service forecasts cast a dark cloud
over that assumption.
   The drought region now extends well into West Virginia and
includes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky and
Tennessee, the weather service drought advisory said. On the other
hand, western portions of the Mississippi Valley have received some
relief due to recent rains.
   The drought has been accompanied by higher than normal
temperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western
Great Lakes region.
   The national picture shows the current drought to be about
equivalent to that of 1911, and still somewhat less severe than in
several years in the 1930s or 1956. However, in the Midwest, the
weather service reported that large areas have experienced the
driest April-June period on record since 1895.
   Recent rains have resulted in local flooding in Texas, but
nationally streamflows are below normal, and even in Texas are
expected to fall back to below average levels. Flows in many major
rivers remain low and continue to restrict navigation.
   Reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation,
however, the weather service noted.
   In addition to Thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-range
outlook through July 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain
hotter than normal, particularly the Tennessee Valley, lower
Midwest, central and northern Great Plains, northern Rockies and
Great Basin. The only areas escaping heat in the forecast are the
nation's northwestern and northeastern corners and the
Louisiana-Texas-New Mexico area.
   Most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal,
although some significant rain could penetrate northwestward from
Texas into New Mexico, Colorado and eastern Wyoming.

<HEADLINE><HL>Crop Production To Be Down Sharply From 1987; Food Prices Suffer</HL></HEADLINE>



<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   An annual Agriculture Department survey
confirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall
corn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher retail food
prices for months and years to come.
   However, government officials said bountiful crops in recent
years has built stockpiles so high the United States need not fear
actual shortages on grocery shelves and can even continue exporting
food.
   The report came hours after President Reagan signed a $3.9
billion relief bill that he acknowledged won't bring rain to crops
already sweltering, but hopefully will help farmers survive to
plant again next spring.
   The new surveys led USDA experts to predict the 1988 corn crop
will total 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from last year's
harvest and the smallest output since 1983.
   Sharp reductions also were reported for soybeans, wheat and a
number of other crops. Cotton, which thrived last month in the hot,
humid weather, is expected to increase from last year.
   Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board put
total U.S. crop production at 88 percent of the 1977 average, a
scale used to compare output from year to year. That matched the
low 1983 reading, when sharp cutbacks in government acreage
programs, along with drought, reduced crop production sharply.
   The corn crop is expected to average 78.5 bushels per harvested
acre, down from 119.4 bushel per acre last year, a record
year-to-year decline of 34 percent.
   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American
farmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production
of meat, poultry and dairy products.
   Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the department's chief
economist, said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of food
this year, 2 percent next year.
   ``Today's reports confirm that the drought has had a major
impact on this year's crops,'' Wilson told reporters. ``But because
of large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most cases
to assure and adequate food supply at home, satisfy foreign
customers and meet our food-aid commitments.''
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said in a statement, ``Today's crop report confirms our
fears about the impacts of this summer's tragic drought.
Fortunately, it appears we will have enough stocks to make it
through this marketing year.''
   The USDA's grim news came hours after President Reagan on
Thursday signed a $3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at
helping drought-stricken farmers recover.
   ``This bill isn't as good as rain,'' Reagan said to the nation's
farmers. ``But it will tide you over until normal weather and your
own skills permit you to return to your accustomed role.''
   The new USDA crop estimates were based on field surveys as of
Aug. 1. In May and June, before drought had made its biggest
impact, USDA projected the corn harvest _ based on trends and an
assumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion bushels.
   But those projections were revised downward a month ago to 5.2
billion bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder
of the season.
   The soybean harvest was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down
23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced last year. Prospects
last spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and the July
projection was 1.65 billion bushels.
   Production of all wheat was indicated at 1.82 billion bushels,
down 13 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987. In May and June,
the USDA forecast this year's output would be up slightly. The July
projection was 1.84 billion bushels
   The wheat total included winter wheat planted last fall, which
barely stayed ahead of the drought. Later plantings of durum and
other spring wheat varieties were brutalized by heat and dryness.
   Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.55 billion bushels,
down 1 percent from last year. But durum and the other spring
varieties, which are produced in the hard-hit northern plains,
showed sharp declines.
   Durum was estimated at 54.6 million bushels, down 41 percent
from last year's harvest, and other spring wheat was shown at 212
million bushels, down 53 percent from 1987.
   Cotton production was estimated at 14.9 million bales, up 1
percent from last year. The crop was projected at 13.7 billion
bales in July.
   Department officials said U.S. grain production this year is
expected to total 192 million metric tons, 31 percent smaller than
the 1987 output. The total grain supply for 1988-89 _ which
includes inventories on hand at the beginning of the season _ is
down 24 percent from last season.
   In addition to the reductions in corn and soybean yields, Wilson
said production of some other spring-planted crops has suffered,
including: oats, 206 million bushels, down 45 percent; barley, 288
million bushels, also down 45 percent; and sorghum, 561 million
bushels, down 24 percent.
   Wilson said USDA experts ``continue to believe that the drought
will add only one percentage point'' to consumer food prices this
year.
   The department has forecast a food price increase this year of 3
percent to 5 percent. Before the heat and dry weather, USDA had
expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
   Wilson said the drought could add 2 percent to the consumer
price index for food next year.
   ``That's on top of an additional estimated increase in food
prices somewhere in the region of 4 percent,'' Wilson said. ``So
this would bring it up to a total of 6 percent.''
   He also said the United States is ``looking at an export
situation that is not as good as it was a year ago.'' He said
production abroad would have to take up the slack in world food
supply caused by the drought.
   ``Our figures here today would indicate that food production in
other countries has not been cut that much,'' he said. There
remained a possibility that the United States would import some
soybeans this year, Wilson said.
   He scoffed at any suggestion, however, that the United States
may have lost its capacity to produce sizeable crop surpluses. He
noted that 50 million farm acres are being kept out of production
this year in addition to millions of additional acres in the
long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
   Meanwhile, USDA weatherman Norton Strommen said rain in the
midcontinent in recent days has not meant an end to the drought.
   ``The drought, as you can see, is still basically with us
throughout the entire United States,'' Strommen said.

<HEADLINE><HL>Unusual Ocean Temperatures May Have Played Part in 1988 Drought</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Some of this year's drought in the Midwest may
have been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equator
in the Pacific Ocean, according to a new computer study reported
Thursday.
   Such droughts could be anticipated if the temperature
abnormalities turn out to be predictable, one of the authors said in
the report appearing in Friday's issue of Science magazine.
   The authors are Kevin E. Trenberth and Grant W. Branstator of the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and
Phillip A. Arkin of the Climate Analysis Center of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Camp Springs, Md.
   They noted that when asked what caused the drought that hit much
of North America in 1988, meteorologists often reply ``the jet
stream was displaced northward of its usual position so that storms,
which tend to track along the path of the jet stream, were similarly
displaced northward.''
   ``Such an answer is, however, just a brief description of the
weather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at the
cause. A more satisfying response would address why the jet stream
was displaced northward,'' the team wrote.
   Their proposed answer focuses on the development in April, May
and June of drought in the Midwest, where several states recorded
less rain than at any time since 1895. By July the weather pattern
they studied was breaking up, and continuing dryness in the study
area and elsewhere probably had other causes, Arkin said.
   But during the April-June period there were alternating high and
low pressure centers across much of the northern half of the Western
Hemisphere: A high-pressure center north of Hawaii, a low in the
Gulf of Alaska, a high in central Canada extending down into the
northern Great Plains states and a low on the East Coast.
   In this period, Pacific Ocean temperatures ranged up to 5.4
degrees Fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about
4,000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of South
America, with the coolest spot midway along the band.
   At the same time, a bit to the north of this band, surface
temperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal.
   When this temperature pattern was fed into the computer, the
pattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems was
reproduced. The below-normal equatorial temperature by itself did
not give such a result.
   ``We haven't proved anything; all we've done is shown that it's a
possibility,'' Arkin said.
   The global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of
a more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these
abnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought, he
said.
   If the model holds up, the work will be the first demonstration
of tropical sea surface temperatures affecting weather outside the
tropics in the summer, Arkin said.
   The authors took note of computer models predicting increased
frequency of drought with the buildup of the ``greenhouse effect''
global warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.
   ``The greenhouse effect may tilt the balance such that conditions
for droughts and heat waves are more likely, but it cannot be blamed
for an individual drought,'' they said.

   America's 1988 drought captured attention
everywhere, but especially in Washington where politicians pushed
through the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history. The
Associated Press went back to track where the $3.9 billion went and
found the money spread far beyond the drought.
</TEXT>



<TEXT>
   The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed
as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell,
became much more _ an unexpected, election-year windfall for
thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's
normal quirks.
   An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found the
drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from
hail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in
Massachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out
bird seed in Colorado.
   Payments went far beyond the initial intent to save Midwestern
grain growers from bankruptcy, an effort _ supported by almost
everyone _ that simply grew and grew and grew.
   At each step, the program was broadened. Congress began with a
bill to aid drought victims. The lawmakers added hail to the relief
package. Then floods.
   Next came ``heat,'' an addition from the Agriculture Department.
   By the time checks were being written at the county level, the
AP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal
agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils
as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even ``ineffective
herbicide.''
   None of those conditions should have been ruled eligible,
administrators in Washington say. Nothing in federal procedures,
however, requires paperwork to be forwarded to higher officials for
routine approval or checking.
   By the end of this October, about one-quarter of all U.S.
farmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and
just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states. The taxpayers'
tab ran to $3.9 billion.
   ``We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,''
said Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who's had
hail damage 23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the
first time in 1988.
   Loose regulations and lax enforcement of them were the major
reasons for the government generosity, the AP found by examining
federal records in 14 states through the Freedom of Information Act.
   The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought
received _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of
shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles
in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief
measure.
   ``Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to
farmers,'' said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University.
``(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of
agriculture.''
   In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands
of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed
good crops at higher prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster
areas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas,
Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey.
   Although some producers appeared to have violated eligibility
requirements _ exceeding the allowed gross annual income, for
example _ their requests for aid were approved anyway by local
officials. Most farmers simply took advantage of a generous
program. As tough as farming is, they'd be fools not to take what
was offered, they said.
   ``It was there, so I took it,'' said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and
corn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because
hail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated
farm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year.
   Government officials say they did the best they could with a
rushed program. Loopholes were tightened in 1989's smaller $1
billion drought relief program.
   ``Some farmers just got grandfathered in, that's true,'' said
Dan Shaw, deputy administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service, which administers payment programs for
the Agriculture Department. ``What percentage, we don't know. But
that is part of the beast I guess that was created. Whenever you do
this for the whole nation, there are some people that luck out.''
   The AP found some farmers who did better than just luck out.
Those growers profited by ``triple-dipping'': reaping crop
insurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops, then replanting
the same ground for a successful harvest _ all perfectly legal
under the 1988 program.
   Disaster payments in several states also went to banks,
corporations, investment firms, churches and even local governments
such as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations
designed to match benefits to small farmers.
   In several cases, corporations ineligible for drought relief
because of the bill's $2 million cutoff on gross annual income
collected anyway because they owned a stake in a farm.
   Santa Fe Pacific Co., the railroad giant with annual revenue of
$3 billion, received a check through its energy division. The
American Cancer Society got a check, as did a unit of Texas A&amp;M
University and the mid-Atlantic headquarters in Baltimore of the
Jesuit order.
   Pryslak Farms of Great Meadows, N.J., a $9 million-a-year
produce, garden and truck farming operation, collected $100,000 for
losses on endive, escarole and leaf lettuce because the local
Agriculture Department official said he thought the $2 million
ceiling applied to just the vegetable operation.
   Wrong, say Washington officials _ the ceiling applies to revenue
from all operations.
   Despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did
provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought.
   In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an
estimated $1.1 billion to the drought, but direct federal aid cut
that by 36 percent, to $706 million. In Iowa the aid, calculated by
the federal government at $335 million, went a long way, state
agriculture secretary Dale Cochran said.
   Without that money, ``it would have meant substantially more
losses to Main Street,'' Cochran said. ``Drought legislation saved
businesses from having to close their doors.''
   To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts
in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought
payments were matched county by county in a computer database. From
those results, the AP selected 120 counties for further study.
   Farm Entitlement reports, the ASCS summaries of individual
farms' participation in the program, were requested for about
12,000 farms in those counties under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Because much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties,
reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to
examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific
farmers, also available under the FOIA.
   One such farmer was Don Gresham, who raises cotton on 4,000
acres near Levelland. Gresham readily offers that he and his son
operate their farms under five different names precisely because of
federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000
per farmer.
   Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected
$248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop
insurance. And he gambled and replanted the lost cotton acres with
milo _ and made a good crop.
   According to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly
$100,000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully.
   ``I'll be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for
me,'' Gresham said. ``You can't farm without the government. You
play their game.''

   The drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper
Midwest _ perhaps nowhere harder than in North Dakota. More
disaster relief aid went there than to any other state. The third
story in a four-part series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,''
examines how the $3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmers
most in need.

<DATELINE>DAVENPORT, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Carl Grindberg survived the drought with
a $45,000 dose of federal aid. But for this farmer and others, it
was a give-and-take bailout: Take the money with one hand, give it
away with the other.
   ``The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' Grindberg
said. ``The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and
chemicals and tires, they got paid. What I'm saying is, the farmer
got the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.''
   The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 million
into North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent
state. The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many
say it also kept the state afloat.
   ``It's what carried us through in 1988,'' said Cass County
extension agent Duane Hauck. ``If it hadn't been for drought aid,
the economic situation all through North Dakota would have been
disastrous. It was the major source of income for most farmers.''
   ``I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought
Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area,'' Grindberg added.
   A study of the $3.9 billion disaster relief program, conducted
by The Associated Press over seven months, found that outside the
Midwest drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousands
of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious
than the normal trials of nature.
   But money did reach areas Congress most intended to aid,
including North Dakota, where it kept some farmers on their land
and may have prevented some business closures.
   ``You might say it kept the state alive,'' said Fred Selberg,
another farmer in this Red River Valley county. ``Everyone in North
Dakota in some way or another was helped.''
   North Dakota, where the drought evoked memories of Dust Bowl
days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received the
most disaster dollars. More than 49,000 producers shared $410.2
million _ about 10.5 percent of the total package. Almost all was
for crop loss.
   The state, the No. 1 producer of hard-red spring wheat, lost
two-thirds of its 1988 crop; millions of normally golden acres
withered to pathetic rows of shriveled brown stumps. But drought
aid cut farmers' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a North
Dakota State University study found.
   Disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banks
and households from $3.4 billion to $2.1 billion, the study said.
Each farm dollar triples as it travels down Main Street into the
economy.
   Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without
drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been
just $6,300. Drought payments added $15,000.
   Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other
drought-ravaged states, including Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and
Wisconsin. The five states together received nearly half the
assistance allocated nationwide.
   Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into
Iowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said.
   ``There was no question it was needed to stave off a major new
wave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Belt
producers,'' said Mark Edelman, a university economist.
   ``Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short
of bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but it
provided a safety net,'' he said.
   It was the same in North Dakota, which has struggled with an
exodus of young, educated people, declining revenues, fading small
towns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade.
   ``From '81 through '86, the bottom pretty much fell out of
everything,'' said Greg Schulz, who farms about five miles from
Grindberg. Good crops the next two years started to reverse the
trend, but drought stalled the recovery.
   ``It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' said
Dwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist. ``Financial aid helps
to alleviate that. The last thing North Dakota needed is more
negatives to push us down.''
   Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the
state still needs ``a good year to get back on our feet,'' Hauck
said. ``We didn't get that in '89,'' he added, referring to
continuing drought in North Dakota's west and south-central
sections.
   In fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12
months ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988's estimated $530
million, Aakre said. Two reasons why: more acres of wheat were
planted this year, and farmers don't have grain reserves to sell at
high prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden.
   Cass County also had a better 1989 crop but expects higher
losses in crop dollars. And while virtually all farmers here
received government aid in 1988, far fewer will be eligible a
second time.
   About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms
in Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres. Wheat, corn,
barley, soybeans, sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grown
here. Last year, production was 60 percent to 70 percent below
normal.
   For Larry Richard, a 36-year-old father of three who farms 1,000
acres near the town of Horace, $39,000 in aid, even coupled with
$55,000 in crop insurance, amounted to ``just enough to break even.
We were able to cover all our bills. That's all I had really hoped
for.''
   If that seems like a lot, Richard, who grows wheat, soybeans and
barley, notes it costs him $150,000 for rent, interest, seed,
fertilizer, equipment and other necessities.
   ``You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is
going to be,'' he said. ``Our investment in farming is tremendous
compared to the average businessman. At least they have a commodity
to sell. We might not.''
   Schulz, who farms 6,000 acres, said that without his $100,000
maximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or lay
off help.
   Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, he
said, ``I was able to mark time in '88. ... Last year we had a
break-even type of year. This year it was break-even. Next year,
we're going to have to start coming around to a profit.''
   Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley,
was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance. His
1989 crop was better but still below normal; he expects to get only
$3,000 in relief payments.
   Grindberg, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mail
part-time, thinks the government last year ``pushed he panic button
on this disaster thing and went too far. In '89, they went too far
the other way I think.''
   ``Disaster aid is political,'' he said. ``Depending on when you
have the disaster depends on whether they sweeten the pot or not.
If it's an election year ... they all get on the bandwagon.''
   But Grindberg will persist.
   ``As long as the banker says go on,'' he said, ``next year's
always the best year.''

<HEADLINE><HL>1988 Drought Effects Not as Bad as Feared</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Two years ago, it looked as if a vast part of
the nation's farm empire was burning up as drought and heat parched
crops and livestock.
   But the 1988 drought wasn't as bad as it might have been,
according to an Agriculture Department analysis. Crop yields
plummeted, but commodity prices rose. For those who eked out some
production, or had grain stored from previous years, it wasn't too
bad.
   The latest postmortem of the 1988 drought's effects was written
by Gerald W. Whittaker of the department's Economic Research
Service. It concentrated on the most severe drought region,
centered in nine states of the Midwest and upper Great Plains.
   All of the information used in the study was from USDA's annual
Farm Costs and Returns Survey, which includes detailed income and
expense information derived from personal interviews of farm
operators.
   Basic findings:
   _Net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to an
average of $28,899 per farm from $38,122 in 1987. Income in
non-drought areas rose to $62,822 in 1988 from $50,967 in 1987.
   As used by the agency, net farm income includes gross income
from farming during the calendar year, including federal payments,
minus costs of production. It also includes allowances for changes
in the value of inventories and adjustments for depreciation and
other factors.
   _Despite drought, farms in all areas of the country continued to
improve their solvency position in 1988.
   _The number of farms considered financially vulnerable continued
to decrease in 1988 in both the drought and non-drought regions.
   _Farms in the drought region received lower direct government
payments in 1988, despite an infusion of federal disaster relief.
   _The average farm in the drought region survived financially by
selling off inventories and taking advantage of higher commodity
market prices to redeem price support loans made by USDA's
Commodity Credit Corp.
   No state-by-state breakdowns were included in the report. The
nine states studied as the ``drought region'' were Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South
Dakota and Wisconsin.
   In the category of net farm income, the report said the share of
farms in a ``favorable financial position'' in 1988 held fairly
steady at 68 percent in the non-drought region, compared with 69.1
percent in 1987.
   In the drought states, 62.2 percent of the farms were said to be
in favorable financial position, compared with 62.8 percent in 1987.
   ``Even with lower incomes, farmers in the drought region
continued to improve their debt position (in relation to assets),''
the report said. ``A major factor in their improvement was the
continued upward trend in land values.''
   The report noted that higher market prices helped reduce the
direct payments to farmers in 1988 under USDA's commodity programs.
Nationally, those payments dropped to $9.8 billion from $11.5
billion in 1987.
   But Congress also provided nearly $3.9 billion in emergency
drought aid to farmers in 1988. The nine states in the study
collected about $2.57 billion, or two-thirds of the total.

   Hunters and others returning to the United
States from Mexico with animal trophies might run into some
obstacles at the border.
   The Agriculture Department says inspectors are on guard against
items that can carry Boophilus ticks into the United States.
   ``This tick, which carries bovine babesiosis _ a serious cattle
disease often called Texas cattle fever _ was eradicated from the
United States in 1943,'' said James W. Glosser, administrator of
the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   Strict measures are being taken to prevent the reintroduction of
the tick, he said.
   For example, animal carcasses with hides attached are not
eligible for importation into the United States. Hides that have
been tanned or soaked in a saltwater solution with mineral acid,
and dry antlers can be imported from Mexico without restriction,
provided they are certified to be of Mexican origin.
   Glosser said raw and untreated hides and antlers may qualify if
they are certified by the Mexican government to have been treated
for ticks. Alternately, they may be dipped at one of several
Mexican cattle export facilities along the border.

   The Agriculture Department is using tiny wheat
fields of one square foot each to monitor the spread of leaf and
stem rust in the Southeast. Results have been mixed.
   John Roberts, a scientist in the department's Agricultural
Research Service, said the tiny plots are planted in July about 20
miles apart along an interstate highway route through Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, then looping back into
Georgia.
   The pilot study was begun in 1986. That was a drought year in
the region, and so was 1987. Then in 1988, some of the wheat plots
on low ground near the Gulf Coast drowned out.
   Highway maintenance crews sometimes mow down the wheat, along
with the weeds, Roberts said. And deer and rabbits sometimes munch
on the plants.
   But Roberts, who works at the agency's research facility at
Griffin, Ga., said the small test plots show real promise as a
survey method.

   The Reagan administration moved to deal with the worsening drought, and a top trade official said that farm export subsidies may have to be curbed. 
   Meanwhile, fears mounted that the fragile recovery of agriculture-related industries will be derailed by continuing lack of rain. 
   Concern that the drought could fuel inflation drove stocks and bonds sharply lower yesterday. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 37.16 points to close at 2094.24, while U.S. government bonds fell more than 1 1/2 points. 
Grain and soybean futures continued their drought-driven rally. 
   President Reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program. 
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the president is "very concerned" about the drought, and "wants to make certain that everything that the federal government can do to assist will be done." 
   While he wouldn't predict what kind of disaster relief might be authorized, Mr. Fitzwater said the drought "certainly is going to drive up food prices. 
We've already seen some increases in some products." 
But he said the administration doesn't believe the drought will have "overall implications for the economy." 
   At a news briefing, Special Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter warned that the administration may have to curb its so-called export enhancement program if the drought becomes even worse. 
This program is designed to boost farm exports by reimbursing U.S. exporters for the difference between the prices they receive for grain and other commodities in world markets and higher U.S. prices. 
   "Clearly, we will have to appraise very carefully the desirability of using export enhancement funds at a time when (U.S.) supplies are unpredictable," Mr. Yeutter said. 
   Shrinking soybean stockpiles and soaring prices have stirred speculation that the government may impose an embargo on exports of soybeans and soybean products. 
Growers still complain about the 1973 embargo, which they say hurt the nation's reputation as a reliable supplier. 
   But Mr. Yeutter said he would "vigorously" oppose any embargo on U.S. soybean exports. 
Earlier this week, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng took an equally adamant stand against such an embargo. 
   Before the drought began damaging crops this month, the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers. 
Hefty government subsidies on last year's strong harvests put a record amount of cash into farmers pockets. 
   But bankers that lend to farmers suddenly are worrying anew about their borrower's financial health. 
Farm equipment makers say they are concerned that sales could suffer. 
Realtors in rural areas say that land prices, which had just begun to turn around, may be affected. 
   For many, the drought couldn't come at a worse time. 
"This is probably putting a damper on one of the most optimistic years in the last eight years," says Richard Hahn, president and chief executive of an Omaha, Neb.-based farm management concern. 
   In April, the price of good-quality Iowa farm land was one-third higher than it was a year earlier. 
Tractor sales by farm equipment dealers were up 12.8% during the first five months of the year. 
   Now, with farmers in many Midwest states expecting smaller harvests this year, these businesses are seeing their new-found trade evaporating. 
   "Everybody is watching the dollars they have," says Allen Olson, a vice president of the National Bank of Harvey, N.D., where the drought has already halved the potential yield of the local wheat crop. 
"People are borrowing minimal amounts." 
   Few in farming expect the drought to trigger an agricultural recession, although more farmers could go bankrupt because of it. 
But all bets are off on how farmers will fare at the end of this year's harvests. 
While crop prices are soaring on weather-worries, yields may be so low in many areas that farmers won't do nearly as well as expected. 
   If farmers are strapped for cash this year, the effects would ripple throughout the farm economy. 
Bob Pfiefer, owner of a Massey-Ferguson farm equipment dealership in Sioux Falls, S.D., says he has already canceled some orders for fear that sales will soon begin dropping off. 
If the drought continues, he says, "it could bring us to our knees again." 
   In Franklin, Tenn., implement dealer Larry Holt is slashing his fall orders by one-third, even though sales so far this year are up roughly 25%. 
He expects sales for the rest of this year to drop 10% to 20% from the second-half of 1987. 
   J.I. Case, the farm implement-making unit of Tenneco Inc., is considering cutting production schedules if the drought continues through July. 
"It's already getting harder to sell farmers tractors because of the drought," says James K. Ashford, Case president and chief executive officer. 
He said that if the drought continues, industrywide tractor sales could turn flat next year instead of climbing the 5% to 6% that was originally forecast for 1989. 
   Among rural banks, loan problems are expected to rise and profits to fall. 
"Before the drought we expected a very solid year" for farm lenders, says Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank. 
"There are a lot of question marks right now." 
   Many rural lenders this spring were banking on farmers losing some of their post-farm crisis inhibitions about going into hock. 
One of the biggest problems for farm banks has been that their number of loans, a major source of bank income, has shriveled as farmers paid off their debts with last year's profits. 
   In Anadarko, Okla., bankers worry now that ranchers are going to make less money this year because crop damage is escalating the cost of feeding cattle. 
"The drought is going to hurt us because it hurts the cattle market," says Lance Shenold, a vice president of Anadarko Bank &amp; Trust Co. 
   The land boom is wilting. 
Because of the drought, Iowa realtors expect land prices to rise somewhat less than the 5% to 10% they had been expecting. 
"Everybody has just kind of pulled in their horns," says Jim Frevert, vice president of Hertz Farm Management Inc., Nevada, Iowa. 
   A big drop in harvests this year could squeeze investors who had planned on good yields to help pay their real estate loans. 
Most of the farmers who have bought land recently did so for cash, but many of the urban investors got in on credit, real estate agents say. 
   Among all the uncertainty, however, some are looking for a silver lining. 
"I will be hurt a bit," says Mark Dadd, an economist who is buying a 420-acre farm in Missouri. 
"But I regard this as a distinctly positive thing." 
He is hoping that drought damage and rising crop prices will fan inflationary fears so high that land again will be a hot commodity. 
"I'm here for the capital gain over the long haul," he says. 
   The drought is also fanning wildly different predictions of how the farm economy will turn next year. 
Some economists think high crop prices will spark more planting, which would benefit agribusiness, while others think farmers will start the next growing season more conservative. 
   Paul Prentice of Farm Sector Economics Associates, a forecasting concern, thinks the drought could so deplete U.S. stockpiles that the Agriculture Department would drop much of its farm crisis-era planting restrictions. 
He is projecting that the number of acres planted with corn could rise by about one-fifth and soybean acreage could increase by one-sixth. 
   Others, however, see little chance that recession-weary farmers would be willing to take the risk of planting fence-row to fence-row like they did a decade ago. 
"I don't see us getting on a late '70s bandwagon," says Mr. Drabenstott of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank. 
"Both borrowers and lenders have developed pretty good memories." 
   The decision by Mr. Lyng, the secretary of agriculture, to allow hay-mowing for 30 days on Conservation Reserve Program land came as farmers and ranchers in North Dakota, Minnesota and other states continued to sell off livestock in response to shortages of hay and other forage crops. 
Nationwide, pasture conditions on June 1 were the worst they have been since 1934, according to the Agriculture Department. 
   Mr. Lyng's order covers counties where livestock-grazing and hay-mowing on so-called set-aside acres already has been authorized, and the drought's effects have been rated as "severe." 
Every county in North Dakota meets these criteria. 
   The department said it won't allow livestock-grazing on land in the soil-conservation program, under which farmers are paid to take erodible acreage out of crop production.
