<HEADLINE><HL>Study Recommends TB Treatment for AIDS-Infected Addicts</HL></HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Drug abusers who are infected with the AIDS virus
and tuberculosis bacteria should be treated with medicine to prevent
full-blown TB, says a study published today.
   Doctors have noticed a growing prevalence of tuberculosis in
recent years among people at high risk of AIDS, especially drug
addicts.
   In the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
the TB usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis
infections, not new exposures to the bacteria, in people who also
are infected with the AIDS virus.
   The doctors warned that besides being at risk of getting
tuberculosis themselves, AIDS-infected addicts who carry the TB
bacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with, to health
care workers and other people.
   ``The aggressive identification and treatment of HIV-infected
intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is
therefore of both clinical and public health importance,'' wrote Dr.
Peter A. Selwyn of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.
   People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria
for many years without getting sick. While most people with the AIDS
virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only
about a 10 percent life-long risk of getting TB.
   HIV _ the AIDS viurus _ weakens the body's defenses against
disease. The study suggests that it lowers resistance to the
tuberculosis bacteria, putting people at much higher risk of TB.
   The study was conducted on 520 drug users who were in a methadone
program. When the study began, 42 percent already were infected with
HIV. Twenty-three percent of those with HIV also carried TB bacteria
as did 20 percent of those who were free of the AIDS virus.
   During almost two years of followup, active tuberculosis
developed in eight of the AIDS-infected people, but in none of those
who did not have HIV. Seven of the eight TB cases occurred in people
who were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before the
study began.
   The doctors noted that 13 people who carried HIV and TB bacteria
were treated with the drug isoniazid, and none of them went on to
get active tuberculosis. However, seven of 36 people with both
infections who did not take the medicine got TB.
   The doctors said that the drug is now administered along with
daily methadone doses at the clinic where the study was conducted.

<HEADLINE><HL>Feds Urge Steps to Curb Rising TB Rate Behind Bars</HL></HEADLINE>
<HEADLINE><HL>For release 6 p.m. EDT.</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   The tuberculosis rate in U.S. prisons may be more
than three times higher than on the outside, federal health
officials said Thursday, urging testing, isolation and other
measures to curb TB behind bars.
   Researchers with the Centers for Disease Control cited a survey
in 29 states, where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per
100,000 inmates in 1984-85, compared with eight cases per 100,000
reported among non-incarcerated adults in those states during the
same period.
   ``In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB has
increased dramatically,'' the CDC said, noting that in New York
state there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seven
times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78.
   In New Jersey, inmates had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987,
11 times higher than the general New Jersey population. In
California, the rate was nearly six times higher _ 80 per 100,000.
   Tuberculosis, a contagious, bacterial lung disease, occurs in
about 22,000 new cases each year in the United States; most can be
cured with drug treatment. As many as 7 percent of Americans have
latent TB infections, and about 10 percent of them will someday
develop a case of tuberculosis itself.
   ``Persons at highest risk ... are close contacts,'' the CDC
said, noting that TB can pose particular problems in prisons, where
there is often overcrowding and ``where the environment is often
conducive to airborne transmission of infection among inmates,
staff and visitors.''
   The CDC's Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis
is recommending TB testing for most new prison inmates and staff
members _ with the possible exception of inmates just transferring
through for less than a week.
   The CDC committee also recommends new tests at least once a
year, rapid chest X-rays for TB-infected people showing symptoms,
and isolation _ off the prison property, if necessary _ for those
with suspected or confirmed symptomatic TB cases.
   The spread of AIDS-virus infections may play a part in the
spread of TB in prisons, the CDC said. AIDS weakens the immune
system, making patients susceptible to infections other people
might ward off, including tuberculosis.
   AIDS tests should be offered to all inmates with known TB
infections, the CDC report said.

<HEADLINE><HL>Study: Blacks More Susceptible than Whites to Tuberculosis</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis
than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic
susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today.
   The research found that when living conditions are identical,
black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the
TB bacteria.
   The relatively high rate of TB among blacks has traditionally
been blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty.
While social factors undoubtedly play a central role, the study
suggests that innate susceptibility also contributes.
   ``We found that there is a systemic difference between whites
and blacks,'' said Dr. William W. Stead. ``Whites seem to be more
able to fend off the organism without it's ever being able to
establish an infection.''
   Stead, a tuberculosis specialist at the Arkansas Department of
Health, discovered the racial difference while analyzing health
statistics from nursing homes and prisons.
   ``It's a very intriguing finding,'' commented Dr. George
Comstock of Johns Hopkins University. ``I never quite believe
anything until somebody replicates it. But I don't know of any real
holes in this one.''
   At the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
Dr. George Curlin called the findings ``plausible and provocative.''
   However, he added: ``I'm scared to death that people are going
to say this explains it all and forget everything else. Of the
total six times difference, what proportion is attributable to
biology and what to social factors? I would say that biology is
relatively minor.''
   Stead's study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
was based largely on a review of 25,398 elderly people who were
free of TB infection when they were admitted to Arkansas nursing
homes. When they were retested at least two months later, 14
percent of blacks and 7 percent of whites showed evidence of new
infections.
   Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that black
inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the
bacteria while incarcerated.
   Another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a
racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB
bacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone
to tuberculosis.
   About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the
United States, resulting in 1,700 deaths. In the population at
large, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as
whites.
   An estimated 10 million Americans are believed to be infected
with the bacteria but not sick. The disease, which attacks the
lungs, has long been associated with poor, crowded living
conditions.
   Stead's study found that blacks got infected more readily than
whites, regardless of the race of the person who initially brought
the infection into the nursing home. In homes where the initial
source of the disease was white, 17 percent of blacks and 12
percent of whites caught the infection. When the primary source was
black, 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted the
bacteria.
   This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected
whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.
   Stead speculated that whites have evolved better defenses
against TB, because the bacteria has long been common in Europe and
parts of Africa north of the Sahara, but is traditionally rare in
sub-Saharan Africa.
   By contrast, blacks are genetically more resistant than whites
to malaria, which is common in Africa.
   In the other study, Dr. Alfred Crowle of Webb-Waring Lung
Institute at the University of Colorado found differences in the
resistance of germ-eating blood cells called macrophages. In
blacks, these cells are more likely to harbor TB infections.
   ``This helps explain why black people are more susceptible to
tuberculosis than are white people,'' said Crowle.
   At the turn of the century, TB was the nation's leading cause of
death. The number of cases fell steadily in recent decades until
1984.
   Experts believe the decline has leveled off in part because of
the emergence of the AIDS virus, which weaken the body's resistance
to TB bacteria. Others possible factors include homelessness and
immigration of people from areas where the disease is still common.

<HEADLINE><HL>Researchers Declare Success in Putting AIDS in Remission</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Drugs are now available that can put AIDS
patients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a
vaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel of
AIDS experts said Saturday.
   At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followed
by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists
said.
   ``We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing
remission,'' said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston.
   ``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of people
who would have died are now alive,'' Haseltine said at the annual
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   He cautioned against a premature conclusion that the AIDS
epidemic may be coming to an end. A number of treatments for AIDS
and AIDS-related infections are available, he said, but many of
them are not available to the poor or to developing countries.
   ``It looks like most of these will be expensive, hard to deliver
and require monitoring,'' Haseltine said.
   ``Unless we develop a vaccine, the future of this epidemic
worldwide will be extremely grim,'' he said.
   A year ago, the prospects for an AIDS vaccine looked doubtful,
said James Mullins of Stanford University. But that has changed.
``There has been a transition in the effort to find a vaccine,''
Mullins said.
   Vaccines to protect animals against AIDS-related viruses have
shown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believe
that similar vaccines can be found for humans.
   ``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,''
said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
   Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that an
epidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the inner
cities.
   In New York City, for example, tuberculosis declined between
1960 and 1977, but is now increasing and has reached the 1960 level
again.
   ``We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades of
progress in our tuberculosis control efforts,'' said Vermund. And
unlike the AIDS virus, which cannot be transmitted through casual
contact, tuberculosis is easily transmitted through the air.
   ``I think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to the
general population,'' Vermund said.
   Many of the cases of tuberculosis are occurring when individuals
who were exposed to tuberculosis early in life contract AIDS. They
lose the ability to continue suppressing the tuberculosis bacteria,
which normally would have remained dormant, and tuberculosis
appears.
   ``It's likely to be yet another health problem imposed on the
inner cities, where the health problems are already legion,''
Vermund said. There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is
spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS,
but that is likely, Vermund said.
   He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic,
probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the
1970s. Homeless people are at elevated risk of tuberculosis,
Vermund said.

<HEADLINE><HL>Nation's Tuberculosis Rate Still Falling _ But Very Slowly, Due to
AIDS</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but
stopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected,
federal health researchers say.
   In 1988, the last year for which complete statistics are
available, 22,436 U.S. tuberculosis cases were reported, down 0.4
percent from 1987, the national Centers for Disease Control
reported Thursday. That slight drop compares with an average annual
decrease of 6.7 percent from 1981 to 1984.
   One reason for the slowing of progress in wiping out TB is ``the
increasing occurrence of TB in persons infected with ... HIV,'' the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the CDC said.
   AIDS leaves the body susceptible to a number of serious
illnesses, including TB, and studies have found that about 4
percent of AIDS patients also are listed as TB patients.
   If the 6.7 percent average annual decline had kept up through
the late 1980s, an estimated 14,768 fewer TB cases would have been
expected during 1985-1988, the CDC said in its weekly report.
   Tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988, as
compared with 1985, but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6
percent among Hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higher
rates of AIDS cases.
   In 1988, 7,720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites,
compared with 8,280 in blacks and 3,637 in Hispanics. The TB rate
among blacks was 28.3 per 100,000, compared with 18.3 for Hispanics
and 4.1 for whites. Another 2,371 TB cases were reported among
Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States, for a rate of
36.3 per 100,000.
   The CDC estimates that 10 million Americans are infected with
the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, an infection of the lungs.
The vast majority will never become ill.
   But the number of new cases is only part of the toll from
tuberculosis, the CDC said. In 1987, more than 115,000 Americans
were under TB treatment: 20,000 new patients plus 95,000 people
labeled high-risk and on preventive therapy.
   Tuberculosis, which is curable in most cases with drug
treatment, killed 1,755 Americans in 1987.

<HEADLINE><HL>Increase Of Tuberculosis Due to AIDS Virus Poses New Health Threat</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   Tuberculosis is alarming health officials again
because it's posing new health threats with its connection to the
AIDS virus.
   A 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in Newark, N.J.,
has caught the attention of health officials, who had been
previously recording with satisfaction a slow, steady decrease in
TB cases over the last few decades.
   They attribute the 5 percent national increase in TB cases in
1989 to the ravages of the AIDS virus, which destroys the body's
immune system and leaves victims open to TB infection, Dr. Philip
C. Hopewell of San Francisco General Hospital said Sunday.
   Hopewell and other health officials discussed the link between
AIDS and TB during the a four-day World Conference on Lung Health
in Boston, which ends Wednesday.
   About 4 percent of Americans identified as having the AIDS virus
also have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis, said
Dr. Dixie E. Snider Jr., director of the division of tuberculosis
control at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The American
Lung Association estimates that 20,000 Americans a year develop TB.
   In parts of Africa, where AIDS is already a health risk,
tuberculosis has become epidemic, said Dr. Annik Rouillon,
executive director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis
and Lung Disease in Paris.
   ``The combination of the two is really catastrophic,'' she said.
   Snider stressed that tuberculosis, unlike AIDS, is a curable
disease and called for TB screenings at drug rehabilitation
programs, prisons or other places where AIDS tests are being
administered.
   Snider also said doctors should administer TB tests to all
persons testing positive for the HIV virus since TB may not be
readily diagnosed in AIDS patients.
   ``It's important we get control of the situation,'' he said.
   In Wyoming, the Centers for Disease Control recorded no new
cases of TB in 1989, demonstrating that it is a condition that can
be controlled and cured, according to Dr. Lee B. Reichman, director
of the pulmonary division of the University of Medicine and
Dentistry in New Jersey.
   ``I have never heard of a rise of the magnitude seen in New
Jersey or, on the other hand, the hope generated by no cases in one
state,'' Reichman said.
   Moreover, unlike AIDS, TB is a highly contagious disease that
can be spread by airborne particles coughed up by a person with
untreated, clinically active pulmonary TB. Untreated, tuberculosis
kills about 50 percent of its victims within two years, according
to the Centers for Disease Control.
   Snider said sustained contact is necessary for TB transmission,
and would not pose new problems for AIDS victims already fighting
discrimination in jobs and housing. However, he noted that there
had been an increase in positive TB tests among AIDS health workers.
   Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium that commonly affects the
lungs but can attack almost any organ. For the last three decades,
it has been preventable and curable through multiple drug therapy,
Snider said.
   Snider said 10 million to 15 million Americans have been
infected with the tuberculosis germ, but only a small percentage of
them develop the disease because their immune system was strong
enough to prevent the disease from developing.
   If, however, a person's immune system is impaired by poor
nutrition or weakened by the HIV virus, people can develop active
TB.
   ``TB is long known as an opportunistic organism,'' Hopewell said.
   The doctors said U.S. minority groups have become increasing
susceptible to TB. Snider said there has been a 150 percent
increased in cases of TB among young blacks in New York City.
   Tuberculosis can be effectively treated, even in AIDS patients,
underscoring efforts to screen persons for the disease, the doctor
said.
   Reichman noted that most American have forgotten about the
problems of TB; from 1981 to 1984, TB cases declined an average of
6 percent per year according to the Centers for disease control.
   But, he said, ``TB is back with a vengeance.''
   While associated with poverty and crowded living conditions, TB
through history has ravaged both the poor and the famous. TB
victims include Henry David Thoreau, Washington Irving, Franz
Kafka, Ring Lardner, Somerset Maugham and Vivien Leigh.
   An estimated 3 million persons a year die worldwide from TB,
according to the American Lung Association.

CSO 
 [Article by Anda Mikelsone: "Number of Tuberculosis Cases in 
Latvia Increases"] 
  [Text] Riga, Feb.4. There has been an increase in 
tuberculosis morbidity and mortality during the past year. In 
comparison with 1992, tuberculosis morbidity has increased by 
14.8%, and mortality -- by 44%. The total number of 
tuberculosis cases in 1993 was 868, while in the 1992 -- it was 
771. 
  Inta Pavlovska, director of the data processing and registry 
division of the State Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Center 
informed DIENA that the increase in tuberculosis morbidity could 
be related to the poor socioeconomic conditions in the nation, 
as well as shortcomings in the legislative process. At the 
present time, there are no laws in Latvia that would require 
infectious cases of tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment. 
  In November of the past year, the Department of Health of 
the 
Ministry of Welfare submitted a medical legislative proposal to 
the Cabinet of Ministers, which would require infectious cases 
of tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment, explained I. 
Pavlovska. To this day, the proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers 
has still not been reviewed. 
  At present, Latvia has 11 state tuberculosis hospitals, 
providing treatment for tuberculosis cases free of charge. The 
newest of these -- Ceplisi (in Ogre rayon), only started 
operations in January of this year. Most of the patients 
there, however, are chronic alcoholics who suffer from 
tuberculosis.

TUBERCULOSIS NOW THE DEADLIEST DISEASE AS TOLL CLIMBS 
</HL></HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll 
could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, 
the World Health Organization said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency, in its first comprehensive look at global tuberculosis in a 
decade, said the disease kills nearly 3 million people a year, most of them 
between the ages of 15 and 59, "the segment of the population that is 
economically most productive." 
</P>
<P>
WHO attributed the sharp rise in part to the growing AIDS epidemic. It 
estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming a parallel epidemic, and it is this trend that has public 
health officials worried," Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, director general of WHO, said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The agency estimated that between 15 million and 20 million adults will be 
infected with HIV by the year 2000, and it predicted that the number of cases 
and deaths from tuberculosis will rise sharply as a result, especially in 
sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people 
had thought that tuberculosis had gone away," said Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor 
of microbiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and a 
consultant to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease of the lungs and other organs 
caused by a bacterium transmitted through the air when infected people cough or 
sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the 
U.N. agency. About half of these are infectious. Also, an estimated 1.7 billion 
individuals worldwide carry the organism but are not infectious to others. In 
these individuals, the organism can remain dormant without causing active 
disease for many years unless the immune system is somehow impaired. AIDS, or 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
An individual does not have to have a damaged immune system to contract an 
active case of tuberculosis. But when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as 
it can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect 
numerous others. This is what is happening in developing nations, where the 
AIDS epidemic is raging. 
</P>
<P>
"In many places, more than half the beds in medical wards are patients with 
tuberculosis," Bloom said. "Many of these people do, in fact, die of AIDS. But 
if they're not treated for tuberculosis, those people will be spreading the 
disease (tuberculosis) in their communities. You don't have to have a depressed 
immune system to get tuberculosis." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, public health officials began to recognize about five 
years ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was 
making a surprising comeback as a result of the AIDS epidemic. At that time, 
they noticed a startling and unexpected drop in the rate of decline of 
tuberculosis cases. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United 
States is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases. 
</P>
<P>
The overall incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is 9.5 cases per 
100,000 population, he said. In New York City, which has the highest number of 
AIDS cases in the nation, the incidence is 36 per 100,000, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
Effective drugs to combat tuberculosis cost about $30 to $50 per person, given 
over six months. 
</P>
<P>
However, the drugs are not always available in developing countries, and 
compliance is a major problem. The drugs must be taken for the entire six 
months to eliminate the infection.

<HEADLINE><HL>  MODERN OFFICE BUILDINGS ARE SLEEK, AIR-TIGHT AND
PERFECT FOR SPREADING DISEASE
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING AROUND  </HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>  A CEO sneezes in his corporate suite. At the other end of the building, half
an hour later, a janitor pauses in his work and yawns.;   The next day, the
janitor is sick with the same flu the CEO had.  
        What's the link? A poor ventilation system that does little more than
recycle old, stale air from one end of the building to another.;   Millions of
American office workers are getting more than they bargained for when they
inhale in a building that has no fresh air. Along with oxygen, they may be
getting flu and other infectious bugs from their co-workers.;   That's
because, in today's modern office buildings, recirculated air can mean
recycled flu and other airborne infections. The evidence comes from various
studies of tuberculosis, measles and flu that spread in a manner that can only
be explained by poor air ventilation.;   "Modern office buildings are tight,"
says Jon Rosenberg, public health officer in California's occupational health
program. "In order to conserve energy, they're often sealed.";   Experts say
the problem is not the same as "sick building syndrome" -- a situation in
which workers are exposed chronically to toxic chemicals and gases emitted
from carpets, furniture and other building materials. Nor is it to blame for
last month's outbreak in Richmond of Legionnaire's disease -- an illness
caused by a bug linked to wet, damp spaces rather than poor ventilation.;  
But as in "sick building syndrome," it's the airtight environment that sets
the stage for problems. Lack of windows is not necessarily the culprit. "If it
has a good ventilation system . . . you don't necessarily have to have a sick
building," Rosenberg says.;   But, alas, many modern ventilation systems
recirculate indoor air with little or no fresh air. So the infectious bugs
that a worker exhales at one end of the building can end up, via the
ventilation system, being inhaled at the other end.;   "The building is not
the source. People are the source," says Dr. Edward Nardell, who studies
airborne infections for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. "Very
bad ventilation makes the system worse.";   In a study published in the August
issue of the American Review of Respiratory Diseases, Nardell and colleagues
at Harvard Medical School found that an outbreak of tuberculosis documented in
one unidentified government building could have been cut in half had the
ventilation been better.;   The study found that 40 percent of the building's
workers -- or 27 of 47 -- were infected with tuberculosis from one 30-year-old
sick employee. The infection rate was as high in some distant parts of the
building as it was next to the sick employee.;   "By recirculating the air,
you spread it throughout the building," says Nardell. "People who had no
direct contact with this case, might have been exposed in far reaches of the
building.";   If tuberculosis can spread in poorly ventilated buildings, so
can other infectious bugs. Respiratory infection experts say that flu viruses
and measles are easier to spread than TB.;   "This particular study deals only
with TB," says Dr. Jonathan Samet, a respiratory-disease expert at the
University of New Mexico, "but the observations may apply to other organisms,
such as the respiratory viruses that cause flu.";   Building workers had
complained for years about poor air quality.;   The building's ventilation
system permitted circulation of some outdoor air -- 15 cubic feet per minute
-- a low level commonly found in buildings since the 1930s. Even lower levels
of outdoor air ventilation, below 10 cfm, have become common since 1973, the
post-oil embargo era.;   In the study, Nardell estimated that if outdoor air
ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic
feet per minute, a level that Massachusetts recommends for buildings where
smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected
with tuberculosis.;   Other studies have documented:;   (check) Flu spreads
quickly on airplanes where ventilation systems consist entirely of
recirculated air.;   (check) Measles are transmitted by infectious air in a
pediatrician's waiting room.;   (check) Tuberculosis can spread in homeless
shelters, prisons and hospitals where ventilation is poor.;   Flu spreads much
more easily than TB. "It may survive several hours in dry air," says Vernon
Knight, a respiratory virus disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston. "In those tight buildings, they continue to recirculate it, and they
probably build up.";   Nardell and others recognize that the solution to this
problem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air
-- can be expensive. Flu and colds will probably never be eliminated from the
workplace entirely, and it may not make sense to install a new ventilation
system unless the air quality is very low.;   In his tuberculosis study, he
found that the biggest benefit comes from improving the worst ventilation
systems that allow very little fresh air. If the ventilation is moderately
effective but not ideal, further improvements yield only a slight decrease in
infectious illness.;   "There's only so much you can do," Nardell says.
"There's going to be a price of living together in a communal society.";  
YOU'RE INTERESTEDEmployees who think that poor air quality at their workplace
is contributing to health problems can call Cal-OSHA, a state agency that
monitors worker safety and health. In San Jose, Cal-OSHA can be reached at

   NEW YORK -- The incidence of active tuberculosis cases in
the city rose 38% in 1990, to 3,520 cases, according to the
health commissioner.
   The commissioner, Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., said that
although the increase causes concern, the city Department of
Health is "acting aggressively to halt the epidemic." The
health department has a high cure rate in its tuberculosis
clinics, with more than 70% successfully completing therapy.
Dr. Myers said that besides special prevention and
intervention strategies for high-risk populations, the city
is providing $1.3 million for additional efforts.

   
   The health department said it is providing tuberculosis
testing and treatment for the Human Resources
Administration's program for the homeless, and will train
staff members on tuberculosis prevention and control. The
department also has an established residence for homeless
tuberculosis patients, and is working with substance-abuse
treatment services to extend tuberculosis prevention in its
programs. The Board of Health approved a resolution last year
requiring all children entering city schools to be tested.
   The Health Department estimates that one million New
Yorkers may be infected by the TB germ. But only a fraction
of a percent of those who have active tuberculosis disease
can spread the infection to susceptible individuals. The germ
is inactive in more than 99% of those infected.
   Those at high risk for contracting TB are people whose
capacity for resisting infection is weakened, either through
diseases such as HIV infection, by drug or alcohol abuse,
serious illness such as cancer, or by poor nutrition. The
greatest concentration of tuberculosis was in the 25-to-44
age group, accounting for 57% of the total. Men outnumber
women two to one in the caseload.
