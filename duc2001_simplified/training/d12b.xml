<HEADLINE><HL>Reagan Promises to Veto Welfare Reform Without Work Requirement</HL></HEADLINE>


<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan warned Saturday
that he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him that
does not contain a work requirement.
   ``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president said
in a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20
miles north of here.
   Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., in the Democrats' response, said
that quiring welfare recipients work may be necessary, but he said
such requirements should be controlled by state and local welfare
officials, not the federal government.
   Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his
administration's economic record, saying Friday's unemployment
figures showed that the jobless rate ``hovered just above the
lowest it's been in 14 years.''
   The figures from the Labor Department showed unemployment of 5.6
percent, up from 5.4 percent in July and from the May figure of 5.3
per cent, which was a 14-year low.
   ``But there are still some Americans whom our expansion has
passed by _ those caught in the welfare trap,'' he said.
   To deal with this, he said, his administration launched a
program encouraging states to come up with their own plans to get
people off the welfare rolls.
   ``Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed
widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old
common sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work,'' the
president said.
   ``Now, Congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare
reform and I have a message for them,'' he said. ``I will not
accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people
independent of welfare.''
   A House-Senate conference committee currently has before it a
Senate-passed bill that contains a work requirement and a
House-approved measure that does not.
   ``Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform,''
the president said. ``If Congress presents me with a bill that
replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of
self-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans on
welfare, I will use my veto pen.''
   Downey said that while more people than ever before are working,
``the fact is that the typical worker in America is no better off
today than he or she was 10 years ago; in fact things have gotten
worse.''
   The poorest 40 percent of American families, with incomes
adjusted for inflation, are worse off today than they were 10 years
ago; the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decade
ago; and 32.5 million Americans remain mired in poverty, he said.
   The House bill, with training and education programs as well as
health and child-care benefits, would make welfare parents who work
better off than those who do not, said Downey, acting chairman of
the Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance and
unemployment compensation.
   ``Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary,
but those requirements should be controlled by state and local
officials who administer our welfare programs, not federal
bureaucrats,'' Downey said.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within the
next 10 days to reform the US social safety net of welfare programmes.
He told the National Governors' Association that he was committed to 'ending
welfare as we know it' with measures to finance expanded job training for
the unemployed, matched by a requirement that people must do some kind of
work for their welfare cheque.
The president said he would focus on better implementation of the Family
Support Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-force
which he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.
'The bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and the
right support systems,' Mr Clinton said.
Advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the new
administration's intentions, fearing that the centrist Democratic emphasis
on requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fall
prey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding of
existing programmes.
These suspicions were enhanced when Ms Donna Shalala, new secretary of
health and human services, last month devoted only one sentence to welfare
reform in a five-page statement of goals.
With the onset of the recession, state revenues have been constrained while
the number of welfare recipients has grown by 30 per cent. As a result, few
states have been able to implement in full the act's requirement that
welfare recipients take part in some form of education or training.
Mr Clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principle
that 'welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life'. There must be
'a certain time beyond which people don't draw a cheque for doing nothing,'
he said. But at the same time people must be helped out of the welfare trap
by providing them with continued health coverage, child care, and expanded
earned income tax credits when they took jobs.
Many states have already embarked on far-reaching welfare reform programmes,
such as Michigan's 21-point plan to strengthen families or New Jersey's
family development programme. Mr Clinton said he would let states experiment
with such programmes, even when he disagreed with them.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Read Clinton's lips: No more welfare: America
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it' was one of
the most popular lines in last year's election campaign. His idea of a
strict two-year time limit on welfare cheques appealed to voters (especially
'Reagan democrats') not just as a way of cutting government spending and
thus reducing taxes, but as a solution to the nation's most pressing social
problems.
In the American mind, welfare has become synonymous with such evils as urban
decay, fatherless children, drug abuse and violent crime. By promising
radical welfare reform, Mr Clinton was sending a powerful subliminal
message: he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban
society.
Since becoming president, Mr Clinton has barely mentioned the word welfare,
raising fears that his grandiose promise will prove as cynical as former
President George Bush's 'read my lips: no new taxes' pledge.
The White House insists that welfare reform is not forgotten but has just
had to take its turn behind two even more urgent priorities: the deficit
reduction plan finally approved this month and the healthcare reform
scheduled for September. It claims both measures will help shift people off
welfare by 'making work pay.'
The budget advanced this cause by expanding the earned income tax credit (a
kind of negative income tax). This gives poor working families a cash bonus
of up to Dollars 2,500 a year, increasing the incentive to take low paid
jobs. If healthcare reform guarantees health insurance for all workers,
welfare recipients will no longer be able to reject jobs on the grounds that
they stand to lose their health care benefits.
In addition, the administration promises to bolster the economic position of
welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to
support their children financially.
Such measures should help. But they are hardly going to solve America's
welfare problem, which differs substantially from that in Europe.
In keeping with Franklin Roosevelt's dictum that a permanent dole is 'a
narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit', the US has never provided
permanent welfare support for single, able-bodied adults. When pundits talk
of a 'culture of welfare' they are referring mainly to the Dollars 20bn
spent on Aid for Families with Dependent Children, a benefit received by 5m
single-parent families. The objection is not that some families in
straitened circumstances need AFDC as a short-term prop, but that half of
those on welfare behave as though they have a meal ticket for life.
So what should Mr Clinton do?
Many conservatives favour the concept of a strict time limit. Once people
accept that benefits are not going to be paid indefinitely, they argue,
behaviour will change. Teenagers will stop having babies and start
recognising the economic advantages of marriage. Those whose welfare
benefits expire will face a stark choice: accept low-paid employment or hand
over children for adoption. At first the adjustment will be horribly painful
but in the longer term society will gain enormously because destructive
lifestyles will no longer be underwritten. With its economic life support
system (welfare) ripped away, the underclass will shrivel.
But no modern president would contemplate so brutal a social experiment. If
welfare stops, something has to take its place. One suggestion is that Mr
Clinton should follow the example of Roosevelt's Works Progress
Administration, an agency that at its peak created over 3m public sector
jobs. After two years, welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer
of a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage.
Mothers with young children would also be offered state child care
facilities. According to one advocate, this would amount to replacing the
welfare state by the 'work ethic state'.
This solution is more appealing than a mere cessation of benefits. But it
would involve a huge expansion of public sector employment and cost perhaps
Dollars 50-60bn a year, far more than the Clinton administration is willing
to spend on welfare reform.
Fortunately there is a fall back position for Mr Clinton: the bipartisan
Family Support Act of 1988, which he helped steer through Congress. This
recognised the impossibility of ending welfare overnight and instead set
targets for the gradual introduction of 'workfare'. Next year states will
receive federal assistance only if they ensure that at least 15 per cent of
the 'employable' welfare case load is working or in training programmes; by
1995 the required ratio rises to 20 per cent. These seemingly undemanding
targets require a much larger fraction of the welfare population to take
jobs at some point during the year.
Mr Clinton could tighten the definition of 'employable', so as to include
mothers with children under the age of three, and set more demanding
workfare participation targets, for example that 50 per cent of welfare
recipients should be working or in training by the year 2000. Such a
gradualist approach would be both humane and cost effective. The only
trouble is that it falls far short of the presidential promise to 'end
welfare as we know it'. Like Mr Bush, Mr Clinton may have raised
expecta-tions that simply cannot be met.

<TEXT>
THE US administration has given the go-ahead for pilot plans to reform
welfare benefits in Wisconsin and Georgia that could serve as experiments
for the broader overhaul of the welfare system promised by President Bill
Clinton.
The Wisconsin plan would cut off cash payments under the principal welfare
programme, known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, after two
years, although it would continue to provide food stamps and health
coverage. The pilot scheme will be started in two counties in 1995.
Republican Governor Tommy Thompson has made Wisconsin a pioneer in welfare
reform, with experiments such as Schoolfare, which cuts welfare payments to
teenage mothers who do not go to school.
In Georgia, the state does not plan a time limit on benefits, but wants to
reduce welfare payments to able-bodied adults who refuse offers of work and
deny increases in payments to families on long-term welfare who have more
children.
The federal government, which has to grant waivers to states wishing to
depart from normal US welfare rules, is also considering proposals from
Florida and Vermont for time limits on welfare benefits, and White House
officials have said that a two-year limit will be a central feature of Mr
Clinton's own welfare reform plans.
The promise to 'end welfare as we know it' was an important theme in Mr
Clinton's election campaign. Although he named a welfare reform task force
in June, the reform has been held up by delays in passing the budget and is
now expected to be delayed until the ambitious reform of the healthcare
system has passed Congress.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Welfare versus wealth of nations: Governments are anxious to
cut the cost of pensions, healthcare and benefit payments
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The welfare state, the glue that binds the social fabric of the world's
advanced capitalist economies, is coming unstuck. The immediate cause is its
increasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member
states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average
increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the
OECD between 1989 and 1992.
In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could
become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.
While short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more
fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine
the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since
the second world war.
Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on
the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in
government spending. Total government spending in the OECD countries has
risen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990. The
biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare,
unemployment benefits and family support. Social security payments more than
doubled during this period, from 7 per cent of GDP to 15.4 per cent. Health
expenditure also doubled, from 3.9 per cent to 7.8 per cent.
The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of
publicly provided pensions. Expenditure has risen rapidly in recent decades,
more than doubling its average share of GDP in OECD countries since 1960.
Pensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public
expenditure over this period.
The growth is largely attributable to three factors:
The increase in coverage as pension schemes introduced after the second
world war mature.
The rise in the number of elderly people.
Improvements in pension benefits, such as automatic increases to match
rising earnings.
The maturing of the welfare state is also a significant factor in the
doubling of health expenditure since 1960. Countries such as Spain, Ireland
and the Netherlands have been extending their public healthcare systems to
provide universal coverage.
As with pensions, health systems have become more generous in the wake of
economic growth - for example, including grafts and transplants that were
previously regarded as experimental. The ageing of the population has also
contributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions.
Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both
unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.
But it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity
benefits, which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older
workers.
Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main
areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to
tackle the underlying causes. For example, governments have become much less
willing to offer improvements in pensions. Moves are afoot in countries such
as Germany and Italy to raise the pension age. Automatic indexation of
pensions to earnings has been weakened in Germany and ended altogether in
the UK for the basic flat-rate pension.
Healthcare systems have been reformed to make them more efficient and to
bear down on the cost of pharmaceuticals. Although there are considerable
differences between national health systems, healthcare reforms in countries
such as the UK and the Netherlands are increasingly converging on models
that use competition and price incentives to control costs.
Many countries have also begun to tighten up on unemployment benefits, with
reductions in benefit levels and more rigorous conditions to qualify. Active
labour market policies have been introduced to promote a return to
employment.
Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures
such as these. But what most concerns those responsible for public finances
is the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push
costs upwards in the future.
The most important of these is demography. Increases in life expectancy have
already increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions. The
number of over-65s in the 24 OECD member states rose from 61m in 1960 to
more than 100m in 1990.
The growth is accelerating, with the number projected to rise to more than
115m in 2000, 131m in 2010 and 156m by 2020. Only halfway through the 21st
century will the number of over-65s peak, at about 190m.
The strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by
relating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age. The
standard measure for this is the age dependency ratio, the population over
65 as a percentage of the population aged 15-64. For the OECD as a whole,
the age dependency ratio is predicted to rise from about 19 per cent in 1990
to 28 per cent by 2020 and 37 per cent by 2040.
Some countries face much greater pressures from the ageing of their
populations than others. Germany and Japan, for example, will both have age
dependency ratios of 34 per cent by 2020 - one person over the age of 65 for
every three people between 15 and 64. By 2040, almost half of Germany's
population could be over 65, though the proportion will fall thereafter.
Age dependency ratios will climb more slowly in the UK and US, to about 25
per cent in 2020 - four people of working age to support every elderly
person. In both countries, ratios will peak at about 33 per cent in 2040.
The most immediate impact of these demographic changes will be on pensions,
where costs will in any case rise as pension schemes continue to mature.
Overall, the OECD estimates that the pension burden could double over the
next 50 years. Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would
be needed to pay for pensions alone - and that on the assumption that the
pensions do not increase in real terms.
In practice, increasing pensions in line with prices might be difficult to
sustain if earnings rose faster. The growing gap between pensioners and
those still at work that would result could be politically unacceptable.
However, raising pensions by more than prices would either require much
higher growth rates or higher taxes for those in work to pay the bill.
The impact of an ageing population on healthcare costs is less clear-cut.
Experts differ on whether increased longevity inevitably means more medical
care: while more might be required for the very elderly, less might be
needed for younger people as chronic diseases become less common.
Additional costs of new drugs and advances in medical technology could be at
least as important as demography in pushing up healthcare bills.
However, there will be an increase in demand for geriatric care and social
services for the elderly. This will be encouraged by social changes, such as
the decline of the extended family in which older people were cared for by
younger relatives.
Other changes in social structure are also pushing up the demands on the
welfare state. Throughout the OECD, for example, the number of lone-parent
families has been rising since the 1960s. In some countries, the increase
has been relatively moderate - 20 per cent or less in countries such as
France, Japan and Switzerland. At the other extreme, the increase has
exceeded 50 per cent in the UK and Australia. In the US the number has more
than doubled. Lone-parent families now typically constitute 10-15 per cent
of of all families with children in OECD countries. In the US it is one in
four families.
The reasons for the growth include the greater ease of separation and
divorce. But inevitably lone-parent families rely on welfare provision to a
far greater extent than two-parent families.
Added to concerns over demography and social change are fears over the
increase in unemployment levels across the OECD. Over the past two decades,
jobless levels have risen during recessions but not fallen back to the same
extent in the following recovery period.
This ratchet effect has worried the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries sufficiently for an employment summit to be hosted by President
Clinton in the coming months. Continuing rises in the base level of
unemployment would further undermine countries' ability to pay for their
welfare states.
Responses to these cost pressures vary from country to country. Germany, the
UK, France, Italy and the US are among countries that have already raised
tax and social security contribution levels.
However, the scope for such increases is limited by voters' reluctance to
pay higher taxes. Where the cost of welfare is jointly funded by employers -
as in Germany - higher contributions are also increasingly resisted by
business, which fears the consequences for international competitiveness of
higher costs. In a global economy, no country can long afford to burden
business with higher welfare costs than its neighbours.
An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in
borrowing to fund the welfare state. But that would also have deleterious
effects, according to the OECD. Average government debt in OECD countries
has risen from 23 per cent of GDP in 1979 to 44 per cent in 1992.
Without either tax rises or cuts in welfare budgets, current welfare
spending plans could increase debt ratios on average by 90 percentage points
over the next 40 years, according to one OECD study. It says this is 'a
situation which most would think unsustainable'.
This is why the OECD's half-yearly Economic Outlook repeatedly stresses the
importance of controlling welfare spending in improving economic
performance. The OECD's immediate priorities for reform include charges for
the use of some welfare services and greater competition to increase the
efficiency of those services.
But the OECD has also drawn attention to the need for action to anticipate
the funding implications of the rise in the number of elderly people.
Tackling these longer-term pressures will require more than tinkering with
charges and efficiency drives in welfare services.
Significant cuts in benefit levels, for example, may be needed - including
greater targeting of benefits on the most needy. User charges could become
increasingly widespread, especially for the better-off. They could rise to
cover a much larger part of the costs of welfare services. And the demands
put on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private
provision of pensions and healthcare.
Measures such as these would fundamentally change the nature of the welfare
state, however. From providing support 'from the cradle to the grave', it
would become a safety net for those who could not afford to provide for
themselves.
As countries become wealthier, moving the boundary between the state's
responsibilities and those of the individual in this way may be a natural
step. But it would be politically controversial.
Yet it is increasingly clear that there is no alternative to fundamental
reforms if advanced economies are to protect their most vulnerable citizens
without imposing unacceptable burdens on economic performance. The welfare
state may have effectively bound societies together through the ups and
downs of the economic cycle for the past 40 years. But a new glue will be
needed over the next 50 years if advanced economies are to pass beyond the
welfare state.
This is the first in a series of articles analysing the pressures on the
welfare state across the world, and examining policy options for relieving
the strain

<TEXT>
   In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years. 
He instructed his charges to draw up plans for "immediate action" that would enable poor families to achieve "real and lasting emancipation" from welfare dependency. 
"The success of welfare," he said, "should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare." 
   The president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families. 
Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty. 
The president correctly sensed that the public wants reform. 
   If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is. 
To build on the momentum he created a year ago, the president must make plain his commitment in the State of the Union message next Tuesday. 
To pull away now would be to undercut the welfare-reform movement just as it has hit its stride. 
   The president ought to challenge Congress to respond to his initiatives. 
His Domestic Policy Council has drafted a blueprint. 
It would give the states wider latitude to experiment with welfare programs. 
Many of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform. 
The president and the governors should be natural allies on this issue, and the chances of success would be enhanced if they could jointly commit themselves to a plan of action. 
   The president will need all the help he can get if he is to convince Democrats in Congress to go along. 
Most have paid lip service to the idea of welfare reform but nary a bill has been put on the docket. 
This suggests that the Democrats aren't as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the American public are. 
   There is a reason for this. 
The Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy. 
This past December, a coalition of some 80 organizations, most with headquarters in Washington, issued a "statement of principles" calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs. 
It also insisted that the federal government has "primary responsibility" for operating welfare. 
   Congressional Democrats seem to be in agreement with the welfare lobby. 
However, the public wants the system changed. 
It will be difficult for Congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the American people are already spending more than $100 billion a year on these programs. 
   The president should take up his case for reform directly with the American people. 
With the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press Congress to move off the deadening status quo. 
With the ball in its court, Congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors, or it can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor.

<TEXT>
   While there is agreement in virtually every quarter that something needs to be done about welfare, disagreement remains over exactly what to do. 
The White House has a formula for welfare reform, as do Sens. 
Moynihan and Kennedy. 
Now the nation's governors are asking Washington to adopt their plan. 
   Meeting this week in Washington, the governors said they want to transform the current welfare system -- largely an income-maintenance system -- into more of a job-support system. 
They would require all able-bodied welfare recipients (except mothers with children under 3 years of age) to work in exchange for their benefits. 
Those who do would be eligible for help with education and training, day care and transportation. 
   Many states already have launched work-for-welfare experiments. 
The results in Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Utah have been promising. 
Substantial numbers of welfare recipients have moved into jobs and off the public rolls. 
These successes have encouraged the governors of New York, New Jersey, Washington and Missouri to undertake their own reform programs. 
   The leaders of the National Governors Association came away from a White House meeting this past Tuesday pleasantly surprised that they were able to reach an accord with the president on many points. 
The conference's chairman, Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, even backed off earlier criticism of the administration's welfare plan, saying after the White House meeting, "I feel better about the prospects of welfare reform than I did yesterday." 
   That is not to say the president agreed with the governors on every count. 
One item on the governors' agenda that Mr. Reagan didn't go for was a national minimum level for an individual recipients's welfare benefits. 
By endorsing a federal welfare standard, the administration would undercut its own proposal to give the states wider latitude to set their own welfare criteria and standards, tailored to their populations. 
   The most unattractive feature of the governors' welfare plan is its price tag -- up to $2 billion a year on top of the $100 billion-plus already devoted to assorted anti-poverty programs. 
However committed the administration and Congress may be to reform, they're unlikely to endorse a plan that increases the deficit. 
   The governors argue that by spending the extra $2 billion a year, the federal government would be making an investment. 
By setting aside more money for job training, day care and other support, they say, taxpayers would ultimately realize savings as welfare recipients are weaned from the public rolls. 
   But taxpayers can be forgiven if they view this part of the governors' argument with skepticism. 
After all, Americans have spent more than $1 trillion over the past two decades to alleviate poverty and curb dependency without seeing evidence of an appreciable return on their substantial investment. 
An extra $2 billion a year added to the present anti-poverty programs (which, as we have mentioned before, if simply handed out in cash would be enough to lift every poor household in America above poverty) is unlikely to accomplish all that the governors promise. 
Oversold political programs and promises are largely what got us into this mess. 
   Nonetheless there is merit in the governors' plan, as there is in the administration's reform proposals, and in the reform bills under consideration in the Senate. 
Most important, the governors would require that welfare recipients do something productive in exchange for their benefits, be it completing school, receiving vocational training or holding a job. 
Only by requiring individual initiative and productivity can welfare recipients ever achieve self-sufficiency. 
   The degree of consensus forming around welfare reform is unusual. 
All the important players -- the president, the governors and congressional leaders -- agree that the goal of such reform is to transform the welfare system into one that enables poor families to achieve, in the president's words, "real and lasting emancipation" from welfare dependency. 
On this point, at least, there doesn't seem to be much conflict. 
Since all of the principals agree on the ultimate goal of welfare reform, it seems reasonable to expect that they can achieve a plan of action.

   How much more of an "investment" should American taxpayers make in the welfare system? 
This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987. 
The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients. 
   It appears that what we have here is something of a Trojan horse -- a piece of legislation that is represented as "reform" when all it does is expand existing welfare programs. 
The bill's questionable premise is that larger expenditures on welfare will reduce welfare dependency. 
This thinking was nicely summarized by Rep. Anthony Beilenson, who said plainly, "The truth is, for welfare reform to be successful, it's got to be expensive." 
   The proposed new spending on welfare should be viewed as an investment, say its proponents, led by Rep. Thomas Downey. 
They point out that part of the money will go for special education, training and work programs for welfare mothers, to induce them off the rolls and into jobs. 
At the same time they say, certain existing benefits -- mainly Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) -- must be increased to offset real declines since the base year of 1970. 
   House members on both sides of the aisle agree that welfare-to-work programs are worthwhile. 
That conclusion was presumably the basis for the bipartisan consensus that was going to produce a serious welfare-reform bill this year. 
But less than a quarter of the $5.2 billion outlay would go for that purpose. 
The bulk of the new money would go to higher AFDC pay-outs, extension of mandatory benefits to two-parent families and maintenance of certain benefits for welfare recipients earning some income. 
In short, the Family Welfare Reform Act amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo. 
   Of course, House Democrats could hardly promote this bill as more of the same. 
That might produce reprisals from voters who've watched their tax dollars build and maintain the welfare system, with little evident return on their investment. 
Instead, after nearly 20 years, the system's defenders and funders repeatedly tell the public that the problem, if anything, has gotten worse. 
So the House's liberal majority hoped to achieve an increase in welfare outlays by making a bow to "reform." 
   In fact, while the level of AFDC benefits has decreased in real terms since 1970, the total level of all welfare benefits has not. 
Nearly all AFDC families also receive Medicaid coverage, for instance; more than three-quarters receive food stamps, and one-third have children who receive free school meals. 
One-quarter receive housing assistance. 
   Together, spending for the seven major welfare programs (those just mentioned plus the Women, Infants and Children program and the Low Income Energy Assistance program) has actually increased since 1970 by 232% in constant dollars, to an annual total $65.7 billion. 
The House Democrats' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious. 
   Measured in the terms that really count -- namely the number of welfare dependents liberated from the rolls -- the situation has become worse. 
During the unprecedented expansion of the welfare state, the most notable and highly publicized phenomenon has been the development of an entrenched class of long-term welfare dependents. 
It is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the Family Welfare Reform Act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency. 
   At the least, welfare reform should have these goals: to shrink rather than enlarge the welfare system, to ultimately eliminate perverse incentives to remain on welfare, and to make work the focus of the system. 
   The House bill doesn't do that. 
By adding several welfare programs to what already exists (without eliminating any), the House bill adds another layer to an already complex welfare system. 
By further increasing rather than gradually reducing the level of benefits available to recipients, it makes welfare more, not less, enticing. 
By diluting proposed work-for-welfare requirements, it diminishes the importance of work. 
   Earlier this year, there were hopeful signs that we would see sweeping, serious welfare-reform legislation emerge from Congress. 
Democrats and Republicans alike agreed on the need for change. 
This rare opportunity is being squandered.
