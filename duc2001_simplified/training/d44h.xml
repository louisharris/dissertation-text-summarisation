FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: US political sands shift under Nafta -
Prospects for the free trade deal are no longer so certain
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JUST weeks ago, the prospects for the North American free trade agreement
seemed assured.
The proposed pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had the support of the
Republican establishment, of Governor Bill Clinton, the prospective
Democratic nominee, of the powerful Texas Democrats on Capitol Hill and most
of the Democratic leadership in Congress.
But the outpouring of public disaffection for 'politics as usual' has pushed
to the forefront of many polls in the US election campaign Mr Ross Perot,
the Texas billionaire. His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs,
and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.
The White House has taken its own polls and remains convinced that President
Bush's support for Nafta is a winning issue. Although many working class
Hispanic Americans believe Nafta would cost jobs, the Latino business
organisations cautiously support the pact.
Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congress
to vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Nafta
approved by Congress this year. Between retirements and election defeats,
one-quarter to a one-third of the House could change, and no one can foresee
the prevailing sentiment on trade issues.
The president is expected to stage a high profile initialing of the
agreement at the most politically opportune time.
Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executive
director of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as a
weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to
Mexico.
A centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to the
Congress in May 1991, in which he committed himself to action on
environmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance.
'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if they
don't send a complete package in these three areas, the Congressional
Democrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn't
matter,' said Mr Freeman.
Governor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of Nafta'.
The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared its
ground well in the House. It now has 200 signatories to a resolution,
introduced by Congressman Henry Waxman and majority leader Richard Gephardt,
which warns that they will not support a Nafta that does not have strong
environment or food safety provisions. Fifty-seven of the 200 signatories
voted for the president's fast-track authority and now may be moving over on
the issue.
'There are millions more people who 'get' the Nafta now,' said Ms Lori
Wallach of Ralph Nader's Public Citizen. 'They have been contacted by their
local churches, labour unions, farm groups, environmental or consumer
organisations. There is a new awareness of its costs and that has come back
to their representatives in Washington.'
In the Senate, Nafta is threatened by a resolution introduced by Senator Don
Riegle, which would permit Congress to amend the agreement in five areas.
'If the Riegle resolution gets through,' said one business lobbyist, 'we
might as well kiss Nafta goodbye.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US Hispanic groups link Nafta support to
side deals
</HL></HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<TEXT>
KEY Hispanic groups in the US are making stringent side agreements, aimed at
protecting worker rights and the environment, a condition of their support
for the North American Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico.
Several Hispanic leaders said last week that the Clinton administration also
had to present a 'blueprint' of a plan to retrain displaced workers before
they would give their support.
The announcement will deal a blow to supporters of Nafta, who counted on
Hispanic backing to get the agreement through Congress. But the US Hispanic
community is deeply divided over whether to endorse the agreement.
Mr Richard Lopez, an aide to the congressional Hispanic caucus, said last
week that differing opinion had prevented the group taking an official
position on Nafta.
Leaders of important Hispanic coalitions such as La Raza, a civil rights
group, and the Southwest Voter Registration Project said they feared
Hispanics in the US would bear the brunt of the negative impact of Nafta.
'The most competitive sectors on both sides of the border would win,' said
Prof Raul Hinojosa, of the University of California in Los Angeles and a
leader of the Southwest Voter Registration Project. 'Trade would produce job
growth on both sides of the border, but the question is how those jobs are
distributed.
'Those sectors of the US economy most vulnerable to import penetration are
those sectors most dependent on recent immigration for their labour force.'
Fifteen Hispanic organisations, including La Raza, propose to set up a
trilateral North American Development Bank to direct resources to regions of
the US, Mexico and Canada most affected negatively by Nafta.
However, business organisations like the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and
the Hispanic Trade Council are enthusiastic backers of the deal.
Mr Abel Guerra of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said he feared side
agreements dealing with issues on the environment and labour rights could
jeopardise Nafta. 'It's a giant opportunity we can't let go to waste,' he
said.
At the other end of the spectrum lies Mr Segundo Mercado-Llorens of the
United Food and Commercial Workers International Union who is vehemently
opposed to the current incarnation of Nafta. 'A vast majority of us
(Hispanics) will be losers unless there are fundamental changes in the
current Nafta,' he said.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Nafta foes campaign on a shoestring
</HL></HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<TEXT>
IN California, labour leaders, environmentalists and the 'Perotistas'
supporting Mr Ross Perot have signed a Declaration of War against the North
American Free Trade Agreement. The site of the signing ceremony in
Sacramento sent a warning to the city's congressman, Mr Bob Matsui, one of
the leading proponents of Nafta in the US House of Representatives.
In Washington state, Nafta opponents wrote alternative menus for a dinner
given for Mr Rufus Yerxa, the Deputy US Trade Representative. These featured
the potential chemical content of the dishes if the free trade pact becomes
a reality and allegedly toxic-laden Mexican produce floods into the US.
Anti-Nafta crusaders drove caravans through Tennessee, California and Texas
to mobilise opposition. Equipped as information centres, the vans cruised
from town to town showing films and slides of the environmental degradation
in Mexico.
With just a shoestring budget - no more than Dollars 200,000 (Pounds
134,230) a year in cash - foes of Nafta have worked for three years to mount
a massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the American public.
Nafta's US proponents - mostly the business community - are spending
millions, bypassing the voters, to convince Congress to pass Nafta.
An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released last week showed 31 per cent of all
Americans in favour of the pact, a slight increase from previous surveys,
while 29 per cent are opposed. However, 63 per cent believe Nafta will cost
US jobs.
Although the Clinton administration weeks ago said it would appoint a 'Nafta
czar' to shepherd the pact through Congress, it has yet to announce it has
found anyone to take on the task. By contrast, the opposition has an
'anti-Nafta czar' in place and making speeches around the country.
He is Mr Jim Jontz, a former Indiana congressman. Nafta foes have pooled
their meagre resources to provide him with a campaign office, and field
legislative directors. Forty-one states have been organised, and every two
weeks the organisers hold long conference calls to plot strategies.
Nafta foes around the country say their protests have persuaded congressman
to back away from support of the deal. One California gubernatorial hopeful,
Ms Kathleen Brown - sister of former Governor Jerry Brown - has been stalked
by demonstrators, who even follow her to fundraising events.
According to Mr Craig Merrilees, director of California's Fair Trade
Campaign, Ms Brown has expressed doubt about the pact, along with the rest
of the state's Democratic establishment.
With the expected conclusion this week of the talks over side agreements on
labour and environment, both sides are preparing to crank up their lobbying
efforts.
The opposition is not awaiting an announcement of the details, said Ms Lori
Wallach, one of the opposition's leaders. The side pacts will be 'silly,'
she said, 'It's the same old Bush Nafta with the supplementals used to
create a fig-leaf.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Battle for hearts and minds over Nafta -
Guerrilla tactics versus White House pomp and press machine
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GUERRILLA tactics by Greenpeace were swamped by the White House pomp in
which Mr Clinton and three past US presidents this week endorsed the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
But the environmental activists, who momentarily disrupted a House hearing
to unfurl a 15 foot anti-Nafta banner, saw their stunt repeated again and
again on evening news shows.
With dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassroots
organisations have succeed in fanning anti-Nafta sentiment into widespread
public hostility against the pact with Canada and Mexico. A new Wall Street
Journal poll, found opposition, at 36 per cent, had reached its highest
level yet with only 25 per cent of those polled in favour of Nafta.
The continued economic sluggishness and the drumbeat of corporate layoff
announcements have hurt the pact's chances and presented the administration
with a formidable challenge. Fifty per cent of the Americans polled
disagreed with the administration's argument that more jobs will be created
than lost and 54 per cent said that wages would be forced downward so that
US companies and workers could compete with Mexico.
Pro-Nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting the
opposition's success in framing the debate against Nafta as a pact which
would cost jobs.
But they took heart from Tuesday's presidential show: President Clinton's
passionate insistence that the realities of the global marketplace be faced;
President Carter's attack on Mr Ross Perot, the populist billionaire, as a
demagogue with 'unlimited financial resources,'; President Bush's praise of
Mexican President Carlos Salinas; President Ford's warning that the country
would be overrun by impoverished immigrants from the South if they are given
no work at home.
'It was a revival,' said Texas Congressman JJ Pickle. 'I think Nafta was
born again.'
To keep the pro-Nafta case before the public, President Clinton Wednesday
took off for New Orleans and top officials in his administration fanned out
on speaking tours across the country. Government agencies have been
mobilised for the battle, given pro-Nafta literature and instructed to boost
the pact in seminars and public forums.
Congressional committees have begun to examine the details in preparation
for writing its implementing legislation, now expected on the Hill in
November. It is believed this process may satisfy some of the Congressional
doubters, who are demanding a 'level playing field' and a speedup of Mexican
tariff reductions.
Pro and anti-Nafta forces are keeping the fax lines burning. A Greenpeace
release warned that two decades of work on environmental protection would be
undermined if the pact is approved.
In response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental,
citizen and labour groups, Vice president Al Gore, Senator Max Baucus and
other lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the
largest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental
side pact, held a briefing to praise Nafta's environmental safeguards.
Seemingly unfazed by Nafta's new show of life, the Citizens Trade Campaign,
one of the umbrella opposition groups, called a press conference to 'debunk'
the Clinton Administration claim Nafta would create 200,000 jobs in the next
five years.
Unmindful of a television camera, its leaders plotted new strategies:
anti-Nafta resolution in 25 state legislatures; a letter writing campaign
and more.
Notable by his absence from the fray has been Mr Richard Gephardt, the House
Majority Leader, who is said to be close to moving from tentative to
committed opposition. He will join forces with Congressman David Bonior, the
majority whip, and three of Mr Bonior's lieutenants, leaving the House
Speaker, Tom Foley, nearly alone on the defence, among the leadership.
'I do not think we have articulated well - the supporters of Nafta - the
very positive and energetic reasons that can be offered for supporting
this,' Mr Foley acknowledged.
Without Nafta, the US relationship with Mexico could 'deteriorate,' and
'much of what people are worried about will happen, perhaps more speedily
without Nafta than with it. Those things have to be presented more
forcefully.'

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Chicago back-room operator to sell Nafta -
Laurie Morse on a Daley drafted in to lead ratification drive
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MAN President Bill Clinton has chosen to head the task force to help get
his free trade pact with Canada and Mexico ratified may lack experience in
international trade arenas. But he comes to Washington well prepared for the
kind of back-room political arm-twisting that will be required to persuade a
divided Congress to pass it.
William Daley is younger brother and chief adviser to Chicago's mayor
Richard M Daley and offspring of the legendary Democratic machine 'Boss',
the late Richard J Daley. Unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother,
45-year-old Bill Daley is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator with
important connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organised
labour. He has never run for political office.
Mr Daley accepted the Nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet
position and turning down an offer to be Mr Clinton's chief negotiator at
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva.
He chaired Mr Clinton's election campaign in Illinois, where he delivered 48
per cent of the vote to Clinton, above the national average, and continues
as a tangible supporter. Most recently, he arranged a posh Chicago dinner
for the president that raised Dollars 1m (Pounds 670,000).
However, Mr Daley's appointment to chair the White House's task force on the
North America Free Trade Agreement is not a cosy political payoff. Recent
polls show that as many as two-thirds of the American people do not support
Nafta, and grassroots opposition fuelled by labour groups is growing.
Mr Clinton himself reserved his support for the deal, negotiated under
George Bush's administration, until side agreements dealing with
environmental and labour issues were reached last month. Many Democrats in
Congress, including some in the powerful Illinois delegation, are
uncommitted. With the agreement fated to unravel if it is not ratified by
January 1, the battle for congressional support will be fierce, fast, and
visible.
Mr Daley was chosen for the job, Chicago observers say, because he has
proven he can sway votes and is willing to take the risk of losing a
controversial battle. 'Bill Daley is no Washington neophyte. Clinton needs
someone with political sense to move this thing through Congress, and Daley
has the connections,' says a fellow Washington lobbyist.
Opposition to Nafta comes from core Democratic constituencies, making it a
potential political pothole for Mr Clinton. Mr Daley's talents have been
summoned, insiders say, to convince moderate Democrats to back the
agreement.
The president needs 218 votes in the House to ratify Nafta. The
administration counts 125 Republicans in favour of the agreement. Clinton
ally and fellow Chicago Democrat, Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House
ways and means committee, is expected to deliver the 20 Democrats on his
committee. However, Mr Rostenkowski is under investigation for improper use
of his post office perks and faces an uneasy future.
By rough count, Mr Daley will have to marshall 73 votes from Democratic
representatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement:
those along the border with Mexico and those with big agricultural, consumer
product, or manufacturing export interests.
His Chicago-style back-room muscle will be an invisible counterweight to the
public tactics of Nafta's most prominent opponent, Mr Ross Perot. Mr Perot's
populist anti-Nafta campaign touts the 'giant sucking sound' that will be
heard as Nafta-loosened jobs flow south of the Texas border.
'It is a very interesting juxtaposition of styles,' says Chicago political
commentator Mr Bruce DuMont. 'Bill Daley is like a Stealth bomber. You may
not see him, but you'll see the results.'
Mr Daley has taken four months out from his Chicago law firm to lead the
Nafta push. He recently rejoined the firm after a three-year stint as
president of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, which was founded by the
Amalgamated Textile Workers union in 1922. Although it passed into private
ownership in 1966, its board is still dominated by high-profile union
officials.
Mr Clinton may be banking on Mr Daley's union ties to help the Nafta effort.
However, Mr Daley, by pushing Nafta, runs the risk of alienating his union
supporters. Mr Jim Jontz, former congressman from Indiana and director of
the anti-Nafta Citizen's Trade Campaign, said: 'I don't know why Bill Daley
would want to be in a position like that. It's just wrong.'

FT  03 NOV 93 / Party loyalties do not apply: The stakes are high in the
battle to guide Nafta through the US Congress
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'They'd sell off bits of the White House lawn for a vote if they could'
 - Jim Jontz, head of the Fair Trade Campaign against Nafta 'It's one
president, all the living former presidents, 41 governors, 14 Nobel
Laureates and 284 economists versus Perot, Buchanan and Brown; it's your
choice'
 - Mickey Kantor, US trade representative
Barring the unforeseen, the latest addition to the matriarchy of all
political battles will be finally decided on November 17 when 258 Democrats,
175 Republicans, and one independent in the 435-member House of
Representatives (there is one vacant seat) vote on whether to approve the
North American Free Trade Agreement linking the US, Mexico and Canada on
January 1. A simple majority of 218 is all that is needed. If it passes, the
Senate will almost certainly follow suit; if it fails, the upper chamber
does not have to act.
The stakes are enormous - for the political credibility of President Bill
Clinton early in his term and for the legacy of President Carlos Salinas as
he nears the end of his, for the evolution of the Mexican and US economies,
and for a global trading structure in which a Uruguay Round agreement
scheduled to be reached by December 15 may be unattainable if Nafta goes
down.
Conventional party lines are irrelevant in the intense retail political war
now going on in pursuit of the 218-vote nirvana. More Republicans, perhaps
as many as 120 according to congressman Jim Kolbe of Arizona, far fewer
according to Mr Jim Jontz, a former congressman from Indiana, will vote for
than against, not least because the original Nafta was negotiated by the
Bush administration. This leaves Mr Clinton needing at most 40 per cent of
his own party to triumph - and therein lies the problem.
For the Democratic coalition that just - by one vote - sustained the
president in the great budget battle against unanimous Republican
opposition, is in tatters. In July it was the 'new' Democrats, especially
moderates from the south, who deserted Mr Clinton while the old liners -
labour, liberals, blacks - held their noses and held fast. On Nafta, the
positions are in good measure reversed.
According to Ms Lori Wallach, a leading co-ordinator of the 'anti-'
campaign, the 'no' camp already numbers 208-210 'including some leaners'.
Bill Daley, drafted from his Chicago domain to direct the 'yes' campaign,
disputes this estimate, counts about 195 in favour and says that some 55
Democrats are still undecided. Mr Jontz disagrees, reckoning there are now
more Republicans than Democrats on the fence. He thinks the freshman class -
66 Democrats and 48 Republicans - is particularly resistant to Nafta.
Both sides hail and blast each new convert. Democrat John Dingell of
Michigan came out for the 'noes' this week, but Mr Daley counters that he
could never understand why anybody thought he would do anything different.
Ms Wallach is equally dismissive of the impact of the 'yes' declarations of
Democrats Joe Kennedy from Massachusetts and Esteban Torres from California.
The latter, she insists, probably could not carry the 18-member Hispanic
caucus.
The politics of Nafta have produced uneasy dalliances among political
heavyweights. In one bed lie the president, the Republican leadership,
including Newt Gingrich, a fervent conservative, the Senate majority leader,
the Speaker of the House, most leaders of big business, and some prominent
environmental groups: in the other can be found the House majority leader
(Richard Gephardt) and most of the Democratic House whips, including David
Bonior of Michigan, the chief anti-Nafta strategist, plus Ralph Nader, the
consumer advocate, most of the labour unions, Pat Buchanan, the right-wing
ideologue, and Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential candidate.
Ms Wallach, who portrays the Nafta divide as one between 'populists and the
elites', says there is little top-level contact with Mr Perot, who first
spoke of the 'giant sucking sound' of US jobs going south to Mexico, but
that his troops offer access to conservatives and small businesses. Mr Daley
says that 'Perot's credibility is diminishing because he has become a
politician', an assessment borne out by several recent opinion polls.
Both sides agree that the role played by President Clinton himself is
crucial. 'He is my number one worry - never underestimate the power of the
presidency,' says Ms Wallach. He got off to a slow start. In the summer he
was consumed by the budget, and more recently distracted by healthcare,
Haiti and Somalia. Meanwhile the opposition was off and running early.
The administration pinned a lot of its midsummer hopes on Nafta's 'side
agreements', covering Mexican environmental and labour laws and guarding
against import 'surges', meeting most objections. But these were only
completed in mid-August, later than planned, and were only partly
successful. Six prominent US environmental groups came out in favour, but
union opposition became entrenched. Most important, Congressman Gephardt,
whose backing could probably have ensured passage, declared he was not
satisfied.
Mr Daley insists it does not matter that the president started late because
'in politics, decisions are only taken in the last few days'. Whatever the
merits of this argument, there is no questioning that the pro-Nafta campaign
is now in full swing, with plans that Mr Clinton himself do little other
than argue for the agreement in the next two weeks.
Every day brings a new media show. Last week saw Products Day on the White
House lawn, a display of 175 goods that would benefit from Nafta. Last
weekend the president went to Boston to maintain that JFK would have been
pro-Nafta. On Monday he appeared at an electronic 'town meeting' with
members of the American Chamber of Commerce. Later this week he is in
Louisville, Kentucky. On Sunday an hour-long TV interview is scheduled.
About twice a week he has 15-20 congressmen in his office for a Nafta
exhortation. He works the phones constantly, and all members of his cabinet
are fully engaged, sometimes inventively. Mr Kantor's latest pitch is that
Japan is against Nafta and would, along with Europe, seek to profit from its
defeat. The Nafta 'war room', operating out of the Old Executive Office
building next to the White House, co-ordinates it all and makes sure that
businessmen keep up the pressure on individual members.
Certain actions, both substantive and personal, get taken with Nafta in
view. Last week's creation of the North American Development Bank, with its
funds available for border clean-up, obviously helped Congressman Torres
come off the fence. At the other extreme, Congressman E Clay Shaw, a Florida
Republican, is demanding that the administration put pressure on Mexico for
the extradition of an accused rapist. Mr Daley says: 'We have made our views
known to the Mexican government on this, though they knew about it already.'
All this activity is matched with fervour and skill by the other side. Ms
Wallach claims to have kept a lid on vote switching. She points out that
Congressman Kweisi Mfume from Maryland, leader of the 38-strong black
Democratic caucus previously so loyal to Mr Clinton, is helping Mr Bonior
garner votes against Nafta, and that only one black congressman has come out
in favour. On broader policy issues, both camps were bombarding the media
with their respective spins after last week's Canadian election result.
'They've thrown everything at us, but it hasn't made a difference so far,'
she insists.
With two weeks to go, neither side will publicly admit the possibility of
defeat. Mr Daley says he will not sell the White House lawn, but seen
crossing it yesterday was a gaggle of living Nobel Laureates, including
Henry Kissinger, last seen being nice to Mr Clinton on Martha's Vineyard in
August. The grass seemed in place.

FT  22 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US ready to back Nafta bank - White House
steps up campaign on pact with aid for affected communities
</HL></HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North American
Development Bank, which would fund projects in communities hit by job losses
resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The so-called NADBank has been strongly supported by Congressman Esteban
Torres, who has insisted on some sort of lending institution to support
adjustment throughout the continent. Agreement by the administration is
expected to bring Mr Torres and at least 7 other Hispanic congressmen into
the pro-Nafta fold.
The administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-Nafta votes, out of
the 218 needed. It is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants a
reason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it is
pushing feverishly to turn anti-Nafta public opinion around.
The White House 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110
Republicans in favour, 65-75 Democrats in favour; and 20-30 leaning towards
it. Under this hopeful scenario, the White House will use the last few days
before the November 17 House vote to cajole, bargain and twist arms to get
the remaining 8 votes.
However the anti-Nafta forces expect a different outcome. They count 190-200
Democrats against, 10-15 Democrats leaning against, and 5-10 Republicans
opposed.
The pro-Nafta campaign this week began moving into high gear. State by
state, undecided congressmen are being lured to the White House for intimate
briefings, as are business leaders and journalists.
Members of the cabinet are being sent to congressional districts, where they
visit and publicise factories that are expected to gain jobs if Nafta
passes.
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday gave his second impassioned speech on
Nafta at an exhibit on the White House lawn of products likely to benefit
from Nafta. He envisioned continent-wide free trade 'when we'll have over
700m people in this trading bloc, united in believing that we can help one
another grow and flourish,' he said.
The Nafta opposition has been just as busy. Across town, the AFL-CIO trade
union grouping on Wednesday had its own products exhibit, but those were
likely to be hurt by Nafta. The speakers were workers who had lost their
jobs when their employers moved to Mexico.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Virginian congressmen feel the Nafta heat: Nancy Dunne sees
protesters trying to influence the vote on Wednesday
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN VIRGINIA the North American Free Trade Agreement evokes a passionate
opposition, but football, apparently, still is the reigning obsession.
A 'not this Nafta' rally on Saturday provided little competition for the
college 'game of the century' - Florida State University against Notre Dame.
Only 115 demonstrators turned out amid the autumn foliage in the grounds of
Virginia's capitol in Richmond.
They came promptly at two in the afternoon and by three most were gone. The
organisers said they were sending a message to Virginia's three wavering
congressmen that a 'yes' vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be
'remembered in November'. That is, next November's mid-term elections, when
those assembled - mostly followers of Texas billionaires of Mr Ross Perot
and union members - would unite to throw the rascals out of office.
'We are absolutely for free trade,' says Mr Bill Diggitt, the state director
of Mr Perot's United We Stand. 'But Nafta undermines our constitution. It
puts decision-making in the hands of international panels, which undermines
our judicial system.' He says he is concerned about the loss of Virginia's
tax base as companies move production to Mexico and place continuous
downward pressure on wages.
'The administration is selling everything it can to every congressman it
can. That's wrong,' he says.
Mr Josh Greenwood, owner of a small hydroelectric company, says: 'I might
run against my congressman myself.'
Mexican workers are treated like slaves, he claims. 'In Virginia there was
slavery, but the slaves were expensive and the people who owned them valued
them. They had better housing and better sanitary conditions than the
workers in Mexico today. The babies of the slaves weren't born with brain
damage from concentrated pollution.'
Virginia has 11 congressmen. Three have joined the anti-Nafta forces; five
have declared themselves in favour of the pact. The three undecided have
found themselves in the eye of a lobbying whirlwind.
Mr Greenwood's congressman, Norman Sisisky, spent Friday meeting groups from
both sides. 'He is trying to sort through the misleading information,' says
his press secretary. As a member of the House armed services committee he
expects the foreign policy implications of the Nafta vote to weigh heavily
in his decision.
This argument carried little weight at Saturday's rally. Mr Ralph Dombrower,
a Perot devotee, brought the results of an interactive computer poll showing
a growing isolationism among American voters.
'The public is becoming less inclined to see the US as arbiter of worldwide
human behaviour and wishes to get out of our foreign policy involvements,'
he says.
The Virginia business community began a pro-Nafta lobbying effort last
March. 'The unions had gotten to everyone. We were going against a tide of
misinformation,' says Ms Kathy Otts, co-captain of Virginians For Nafta.
The coalition - 100 of the state's largest businesses and 500 small and
medium-sized companies - counter-attacked with an 'education' campaign.
Company employees were exhorted to write or call their congressman.
The anti-Nafta forces on Saturday published long lists of business
contributors to the pro-Nafta congressmen. 'Constituents only have votes to
give, and it seems these congressmen are having a hard time hearing their
message,' the cover page said.
On Friday, after the fifth pro-Nafta congressman announced his position, a
dispirited Lorrie Beckwith, an opposition organiser, said her campaign had
been hindered early on by a lack of unity. President Bill Clinton seemed to
be buying off the undecided congressmen. One was reported to have been
promised that a manufacturing research centre would be located in his
district. Another was said to have received assurances of funding for a new
aircraft carrier to be built in his district. A visit to Congressman Sisisky
had not been encouraging, says Mr Beckwith.
'He says he had a bad feeling about the agreement in his gut. He was
concerned it may hurt family farms. But if he is offered a decent project,
he says he might find it tough to say no.'
In Portsmouth, Virginia, one of the last undecided congressmen, Owen
Pickett, is in his district office, as he is every weekend. His door bears a
sign, 'This office belongs to the people of the second district of
Virginia'.
The unionised port workers are urging opposition. The military, which
comprises most of the district's voters, are worried about jobs in the face
of Pentagon cutbacks. 'He will listen to everyone's side,' a Pickett aide
says.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: Traders nonplussed by trade vote - Wall Street
</HL></HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE POLITICS of international trade can be devilishly complicated
</DATELINE>

<TEXT>
just try explaining what GATT, the Uruguay Round or Blair House are all
about - but US investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the
North American Free Trade Agreement: if Congress passes the treaty next
week, it will be good for the economy, good for US companies, good for the
stock markets, and good for President Clinton.
Their reasoning is quite simple. Investors believe that Nafta will lift
corporate profits because in a more open trading environment between the
three signatory countries the US, with its superior industrial productivity
rates and better-quality products, will enjoy the greatest economic
benefits. The expectation is that growth in US exports to Mexico and Canada
will outpace growth in imports from its neighbours to the north and south.
Investors are not alone in their optimistic view of Nafta. Most Wall Street
economists are pro-Nafta, as are the majority of business leaders, if recent
polls are to be believed.
There is, however, the dark side of Nafta to consider. What if Congress
votes no? Investors fear that a rejection of Nafta would have dangerous
knock- on effects around the world, depressing share prices in the US, Latin
America and eventually Europe, and endangering vital trade negotiations over
the Uruguay Round. By coincidence, the day after next week's Nafta vote,
Clinton will be in Seattle for a trade conference with leaders of Asian
Pacific Nations. If he arrives there fresh from defeat on Nafta, the
President's authority on trade issues will be compromised.
Investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on Nafta would throw such a
spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of
international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic
growth.
In this scenario, inflation would be the biggest concern of markets. Many
economists argue that the competitive forces unleashed by the accelerating
collapse of international trade barriers have helped restrain global
inflation. Low worldwide inflation has kept bond yields at historic lows,
which in turn have boosted share prices to record highs in many markets.
Thus, any reversal in that trend - a return of trade barriers, higher
inflation, higher bond yields, - could undermine equity markets that are
already vulnerable to a sharp downward correction because of expensive stock
valuations.
Then there is the political cost of Nafta's failure to consider. Although
the President inherited the trade pact from his Republican predecessor, he
has invested a lot of his own political capital in getting Nafta through
Congress. On paper, this should not be a particularly difficult task,
because Congress is controlled by Democrats.
Yet, opposition to Nafta among Democratic legislators beholden to labour
interests is considerable. Anti-Nafta forces have warned that opening up
trade with Mexico will lead to a migration of American jobs south of the
border, where wages are much lower. Because the domestic labour market
remains weak, this line has struck a strong chord with ordinary Americans.
The result is that the President faces a tough fight ensuring that the House
of Representatives votes to approve the treaty on Wednesday.
As of yesterday, the outcome of the vote was deemed too close to call. Stock
markets in Mexico and the US, however, believe the chances of success for
Nafta improved this week. Share prices in Mexico rose on Wednesday and
Thursday, and US stocks made solid gains, following the televised debate on
Tuesday between Vice-President Al Gore and Ross Perot, who is Nafta's most
celebrated opponent.
Gore clearly bested Perot in a heated war of words, and polls taken over the
next few days revealed that more Americans had been won over to Nafta.
Whether this helped swing the votes of some anti-Nafta legislators the
Clinton administration's way remains to be seem.
Nafta is playing on investors' minds because doubts over its passage through
Congress have arisen at a vulnerable time for stock and bond prices. A week
ago bond yields jumped amid worries that resurgent economic growth might
rekindle inflation. Although data released this week on producer and
consumer prices showed that fears of rising inflation are, at least for now,
unjustified, equity investors remain nervous about rising bond yields.
Amid all the doubts over the Nafta, one thing is certain, trading on markets
next week is likely to be hamstrung by uncertainty over Wednesday night's
vote, which, like the battle over President Clinton's first budget, will be
extremely close.

THE FIGHT over the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday shifted
outside Washington to the Congressional districts of members, sampling
public opinion at home during this Veterans' Day holiday weekend.
The pro-Nafta forces, exulting over the debate victory of Vice President Al
Gore over Texan billionaire Ross Perot, hoped they had finally captured the
elusive momentum necessary to carry them to victory in the House vote next
Wednesday. A USA Today/CNN poll of debate watchers found support for the
trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had shot up from 34 per cent
before the debate to 57 per cent after it.
Arthur Andersen &amp; Company yesterday released a survey, by its tax and
business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives
of medium-sized companies in Canada, Mexico and the US strongly support
Nafta.
Meanwhile in Mexico the country's Congress launched a fierce attack on Mr
Perot and other critics of its political system yesterday, in a furious
response to Mr Perot's comments in the debate.
Mr Perot claimed Mexicans were treated worse than animals and livestock in
the US, were oppressed by the government, and enjoyed few if any labour and
democratic rights. He said just 34 families owned half the country, and some
85m others lived in poverty.
The Mexican Congress issued a statement, supported by most political
parties, which said: 'We cannot ignore however, that certain judgments
expressed, apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country, attack
and offend Mexicans. We condemn them as inadmissible and without
foundation.'
US opponents of Nafta believe that fear of job and investment losses to
Mexico will outweigh any new-found enthusiasm for the pact.
'The only thing that matters is the economy,' said Mr Christopher Whalen, a
Washington trade consultant.
'The political equation still is going to be that congressmen who vote for
Nafta will have to look for other employment next year.'
Trying to blunt any momentum for the administration, Congressman David
Bonior, an anti-Nafta whip, on Wednesday announced that he had 219 of 434
members pledged to vote against the pact. However, he needs at least 10-12
votes more than the majority to prevent last-minute switches, as the
Administration increases its pressure.
The Administration this week has picked up 10 public endorsement votes, and
claims to have a total of 192. It is publishing a free 800 telephone number
with the offer to voters to send, free of charge, pro-Nafta telegrams to
their congressman.
Around the country, the opposition troops are planning rallies, marches,
town hall meetings and 'accountability meetings' with congressmen. Ms Lori
Wallach, an anti-Nafta leader, said Nafta would be won or lost in the
congressmen's home districts.
Washington will not be bereft of activity over the long weekend. The
anti-Nafta Citizens' Trade Campaign is bringing 'Nafta Claus' to the Capitol
to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell Nafta to a
reluctant Congress.

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Neighbours line up at the door of Nafta -
Caribbean basin nations hope for help to ease the pain
</HL></HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Central American and Caribbean governments are awaiting with more than
passing interest an imminent US statement on measures to cushion the
economic dislocation which the region expects from the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
However, Washington's proposals, promised by Mr Alexander Watson, assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, are likely to disappoint
Caribbean basin governments which have been seeking a comprehensive package
to allow free access to the US and Canadian markets. The US proposals could
also be 'at a cost' to the region, say some Caribbean officials.
Claiming that a more competitive Mexico, with free access to the US and
Canada, will capture markets which Caribbean basin countries have developed
under current trade agreements, the region has asked for 'parity' with
Mexico in exporting to Nafta signatories.
Some regional government officials and US legislators supportive of the
Caribbean's concerns - which include the possible diversion of investments
to Mexico - have now concluded that what would amount to a de facto
extension of Nafta is unlikely. They believe that the US administration
would not again willingly confront the coalition of opposition which fought
the implementing legislation last November.
The measures to be announced by the US are a result of discussions last year
between President Bill Clinton and leaders from the Caribbean and Central
America. Mr Clinton and his Mexican counterpart, Mr Carlos Salinas, assured
the Caribbean basin countries that they would not be adversely affected by
the implementation of Nafta, and that efforts would be made to protect their
markets in the US and Canada.
What the Caribbean basin countries want is quick action by legislators in
Washington, and then in Ottawa and Mexico City, to ratify proposals by some
US congressmen to put all the region's exports to the US and Canada on a par
with Mexico's.
The parity proposals are aimed at giving Caribbean basin countries an open
door to the Nafta market for three years. During this time they would have
the opportunity of negotiating their future trade relationship with the
Nafta signatories, with the option of seeking membership either as
individual states or as a group.
'President Clinton has said his administration will ensure that the benefits
of Nafta are felt by the Caribbean countries,' said Mr Manuel Esquivel,
prime minister of Belize. 'We are heartened by President Salinas' assurances
that it is not Mexico's intention to take investments away from the
Caribbean. But we remain apprehensive.'
There is yet no indication of what the US administration will propose for
the Caribbean basin. Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary-general of the Caribbean
Community (Caricom), said he expected parity to be given to 'only a few' of
the region's exports, including textiles.
'The parity issue, which is the first step we are seeking, is becoming a
case of limited benefits for a very great price,' he said. While willing to
give parity to a few products, the US wanted the Caribbean basin countries
to meet new conditions, including bilateral investment treaties,
intellectual property rights agreements, workers' rights and environmental
legislation, democracy, good governance and accountability, Mr Carrington
said.
'The costs of parity are much higher than we anticipated and any thoughts of
full membership of Nafta are as far down the road as they ever were.'
In presenting their case for parity, Caribbean leaders have argued that the
US and Canada will also be the losers if there is extensive economic
dislocation in the region caused by a loss of markets to Mexico. Mr P J
Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister, claimed that many jobs in the US
depended on trade flows between that country and the Caribbean region.
'Each Dollars 1bn of US exports to the region creates 20,000 new jobs in the
US,' he said. 'In the past 10 years US exports to the Caribbean basin have
doubled, making the region the tenth largest market for US exporters. As
Caribbean economies grow our ability to absorb US exports will also
increase.
'Currently 60 cents of every dollar earned by the Caribbean returns to the
US through the purchase of US goods, compared with only 10 cents for each
dollar spent by Asia. This is why we must pursue efforts to ensure that the
question of the granting of parity be given early and positive
consideration.'
Without improved access to the US and Canadian markets to counter Mexico's
benefits under Nafta, the Caribbean basin countries will have to continue
depending on their current trade preference agreements with the US and
Canada.
The benefits from these were diminishing, said Mr Carrington, as the
region's exports became less competitive and Mexican products enjoyed the
benefits of the market.
'The Nafta playing field will never be level for the region,' he said.
'Nobody is going to give us an even playing field, but we have to work to
make it less uneven.'
