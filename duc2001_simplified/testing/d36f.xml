President Bush today said he could suppport an
increased minimum wage but only if Congress also established a
sub-minimum training wage he said would prevent a loss of jobs.
``I've always said that my position on minimum wage is that I
would want it linked to a training wage, to a differential of sorts,
so that you don't throw people out of work by raising the minimum
wage,'' Bush said at a White House news conference.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had a ``certain flexibility'' on the question and
would await the recommendations of Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
At no point did he say outright that he supported raising the
minumum wage, which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The president's comments came a day after Mrs. Dole told the
Senate Labor Committee that Bush's support of legislation to raise
the minimum wage would hinge on whether lawmakers included a
training wage in the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Bush's stand puts him in opposition to the head of the Labor
Committee, Edward M. Kennedy, who said Thursday he remained opposed
to a training wage and was confident his bill to raise the minimum
hourly wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 would pass this year.
</P>
<P>
Bush during the presidential campaign said in one interview that
he supported some increase in the minimum wage, provided it was
coupled with the training wage, although at other times his campaign
said Bush was against an increase.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dole, sworn in to her Cabinet post four hours before the
hearing, was not specific as to how high Bush favors raising the
minimum wage or what kind of time limit to set on the training wage.
</P>
<P>
Employers would be limited as to the length of time they could pay
the training wage to a new worker.
``We have really not at this point had an opportunity to work
through the legislative agenda so I do want an opportunity to go
through this before I get into any great detail of what he is
willing to support,'' Mrs. Dole said.
``We're going to get it raised this year for sure,'' Kennedy,
D-Mass., said at the hearing, which he called to assess the impact
of projected labor shortages and the prospect of averting them by
training welfare recipients and lower-income workers for high-skills
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dole said she could help erase the so-called ``skills gap''
in the American labor force by working to better coordinate the
numerous job-training programs of government agencies and placing an
emphasis on training the poor and unemployed.
``Minorities, the disadvantaged, persons with disabilities and
other groups traditionally left behind will be in demand by
employers as never before, but only if they are qualified,'' Mrs.
</P>
<P>
Dole said.
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview after the hearing, Kennedy, who introduced
his minimum wage bill Wednesday, said ``my views haven't changed''
and that he would try to get the bill through the Senate without a
provision for a training wage.
</P>
<P>
Organized labor supports the increased minimum wage but opposes
the training wage, in part because it believes some employers would
use the lower wage to cut their costs by hiring people at the
training wage and laying off higher-paid workers. Mrs. Dole said she
would support adding language to the legislation to prevent that.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's bill would raise the minimum wage from $3.35 an hour,
its level since 1981, to $4.55 in three annual increases of 40 cents
an hour. The wage then would be indexed to 50 percent of the hourly
average income for U.S. workers. A similar bill has been introduced
in the House.

<P>
Backers of House legislation to raise the
minimum wage lowered their target to $4.55 an hour on the eve of
debate as President Bush declared he had the votes to sustain a veto
should Congress go above $4.25.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic sponsors of the bill, scheduled for floor debate
beginning today, also agreed Tuesday to include a sub-minimum
training wage in their measure, a 60-day proposal that falls far
short of the six-month period demanded by Bush.
</P>
<P>
And the president, at a White House meeting with reporters,
insisted he had made his best and last offer to raise the wage,
which has been frozen for eight years.
</P>
<P>
Bush appeared with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who was there
to deliver a letter from 35 Republican senators who promised to side
with Bush should he veto minimum-wage legislation that fails to meet
White House guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The administration guidelines include raising the minimum wage,
now at $3.35 an hour, to $4.25 an hour by 1992, provided employers
can pay new hires a ``training wage'' of $3.35 an hour for six
months. The administration says the sub-minimum wage is needed for
employers to create and fill entry-level jobs.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dole, appearing today on ``CBS This Morning,'' said, ``Many
more jobs and job opportunities are saved if you have a six-month
training wage.''
The minimum wage ``is not the tool for lifting people out of
poverty. Most people on minimum wage are very young, they are
part-time workers ... they're living at home and they're not in
poverty,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``If we are trying to lift people out of
poverty, let's go to other means such as training and education and
literacy.''
``There's enough votes in our grasp here to see that we don't
bust the budget and increase the pressures on inflation by going
beyond that which the secretary and I have agreed on,'' Bush said
Tuesday. ``We've thought out a level of increase on the minimum wage
that would help people and yet would not add gasoline to any
inflation fires that are burning.''
The 35 senators, if their support for Bush held, would leave
Democrats short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
``For eight years this same coalition of Republican senators has
blocked any increase in the minimum wage,'' said Sen. Edward M.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor of a Senate bill to raise the minimum wage
to $4.65 by 1992. ``Every American who works for a living deserves a
living wage, not a sub-poverty wage.''
Senate floor action is still pending on Kennedy's bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill due for House debate today calls for raising the minimum
wage to $4.65 by 1992 and has no provision for a sub-minimum
training wage, an idea long opposed by the sponsors and organized
labor, which has been lobbying heavily against such proposals.
</P>
<P>
But the sponsors, facing mounting pressure from the White House
and moderate Democrats, agreed to scale back the final level to
$4.55 and add a training wage in an amendment worked out Tuesday
that has the support of the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, they said they would move up the
effective date of the initial increase, to $3.85 an hour, to Oct. 1,
three months earlier than had been planned. The amendment, to be
offered Thursday, calls for then boosting the minimum wage to $4.25
on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year later.
</P>
<P>
The 60-day training wage would apply only to new entrants in the
job market, exclude agricultural workers, and expire on Sept. 30,
1992, according to aides. The training wage would initially be $3.35
an hour but would increase to 85 percent of the subsequent increases
in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
Workers hired to fill jobs that had been vacated by recent
layoffs could not be paid the training wage, a provision designed to
prevent abuse of the system in order to pay lower wages.

Minimum Wage Battle Shifts To Senate
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House passage of a plan to raise the minimum
wage shifts the partisan battle to the Senate, where the leading
proponent of an increase is urging President Bush to refrain from
further veto threats while Congress settles on a final bill.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 248-171 Thursday in favor of legislation that
would raise the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.55
by October 1991, with the first increase taking effect later this
year.
</P>
<P>
The House then joined the Senate on an Easter recess that ends
April 3.
</P>
<P>
High on the Senate agenda when it returns is a bill sponsored by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that would raise the minimum wage
to $4.65 by 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy has said he is open to amending his bill, and in a
statement issued after the House vote he asked Bush, who has
threatened to veto any attempt to raise the hourly minimum above
$4.25, to keep an open mind until the House and Senate agree on a
bill.
``This is an excellent opportunity for Congress and the
administration to demonstrate that they can work together and in
doing so achieve a fair increase in the minimum wage and an honest
training wage,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
Bush has insisted that a six-month sub-minimum training wage
covering all newly hired employees be created in any legislation to
raise the minimum wage, a provision he said will help offset
potential job losses caused by raising the minimum.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the House bill, while disputing GOP projections of
massive job losses, added a provision allowing a sub-minimum wage to
be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job.
</P>
<P>
That falls far short of the White House demand and, with Kennedy
also opposed to Bush's training-wage proposal, that issue likely
will be a major sticking point in any attempts to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Several Republicans insisted that Democrats were going to have to
give in to Bush _ who appears to have the votes to sustain a veto _
or let a ninth year pass without any change in the minimum wage.
``The question is do you want a bill or do you want a political
issue?'' Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., said during an unsuccessful
GOP effort to substitute Bush's proposal for the House leadership's
measure. ``If you truly want to raise the minimum wage this is the
only game in town.''
But Democrats argued they had given enough by cutting the final
increase from $4.65 an hour to $4.55 and by adding the new-hire wage.
</P>
<P>
As amended, the House bill would boost the minimum wage to $3.85
an hour on Oct. 1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year
later. The provision for the new-hire wage, to be pegged at 85
percent of the minimum wage, would expire Sept. 30, 1992.
</P>
<P>
It also would expand exemptions allowing small businesses to pay
wages lower than the minimum wage and would allow employers of
workers who earn tips to pay them 50 percent of the minimum wage,
down from the current 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less
than $362,000 from the minimum-wage law; the House bill increased
that level to $500,000. The provision is rarely used, however,
because of confusing regulations lawmakers say will be simplified in
conference committee if the Senate passes a minimum-wage bill.

Minimum Wage Plan Would Force Showdown With Bush

<P>
President Bush today renewed his threat to
veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond $4.25 an hour as
Senate Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage
floor to $4.55.
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who met with Bush and
relayed his comments to reporters, said the president ``made it
abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility, not one
penny, not one deviation'' from his position on the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
Bush met with Republican congressional leaders hours before the
Senate opened debate on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
would raise the hourly minimum from $3.35 to $4.65 by January 1992
and contains no provision allowing a lower wage for new workers.
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his
measure identical to the House bill passed two weeks ago, which has
a final wage of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants
in the job market a ``sub-minimum'' for two months.
</P>
<P>
Bush has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new
employees a sub-minimum ``training wage'' for six months. The GOP
leaders who met with Bush said he also reiterated his opposition to
shortening that time frame.
</P>
<P>
Another of the Republicans with whom Bush met, Sen. Thad
Cochran, R-Miss., told reporters afterward that ``the message that
was given to the president by the Senate (GOP) leadership was that
we're going to stand with him on the minimum wage issue. And we
urged him not to back down from his commitment to $4.25 and the
six-month training wage.''
Republicans could thwart the Democrats' quick-passage strategy
by staging a filibuster, but an aide to one leading GOP senator
said there were no plans to do that. The aide said it appeared the
Democrats had the votes to win passage of their plan by early next
week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new poll said there was overwhelming public support
for an increase in the minimum wage, which has been at $3.35 since
1981.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post@ABC News survey, conducted March 30 through
April 3, said 84 percent of respondents backed an increase while 14
percent did not. Eighty-two percent said they favored an increase
even if it would trigger higher consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
But only about half of the 84 percent who initially favored a
higher minimum wage said they would hold to that opinion even if it
meant businesses would stop hiring, or would fire, workers because
of added payroll costs caused by a higher minimum wage. The poll
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
By agreeing to amend his bill, Kennedy, provided the amended
version wins passage, averts the need for a conference committee to
resolve differences between the House and Senate versions.
</P>
<P>
A number of other amendments were also expected, including a GOP
attempt to substitute Bush's proposal.
</P>
<P>
A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage said Bush's
repeated veto threats had all but quashed any hopes by Democratic
sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president.
``He says he won't compromise so I don't see a need for us to do
anything except send him our bill,'' said AFL-CIO lobbyist Robert
McGlotten.
</P>
<P>
Bush has been adamant in saying he would veto the House-passed
bill and appears to have the votes to sustain a veto in both
chambers of Congress.
</P>
<P>
While the House-passed bill cuts the final target of the hourly
minimum wage to $4.55, it moves up the effective dates of the three
increases from Jan. 1 to Oct. 1 _ meaning the first increase would
come this year and the last jump would occur Oct. 1, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Bush has proposed three 30-cent increases in the minimum wage
beginning Jan. 1, 1990, and ending two years later with the hourly
minimum at $4.25.
</P>
<P>
The president said his support for those increases hinges on a
provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage
for six months regardless of any past experience with another
employer. The sub-minimum, under the Bush plan, would be $3.35 an
hour after the first increase in the minimum wage. It would rise to
$3.40 an hour by 1992.
</P>
<P>
The House-passed bill sets the wage for new hires _ provided it
is their first job _ at $3.35 effective Oct. 1. When the subsequent
increases in the minimum wage took effect the sub-minimum would
rise as well, to 85 percent of the minimum. The provision allowing
the new-hire wage would expire on Sept. 30, 1992.

FT  30 MAR 92 / Higher minimum wage, more hamburger-flippers
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A MINIMUM wage is a convenient and effortless way for a left-of-centre
government to appear to be doing something about the problems of poverty,
public sector pay and the growth of unskilled employment. It is also largely
ineffective at solving any of them. But Labour's proposed minimum wage would
only be positively harmful if, as the Tories claim, it will reduce
employment. The recent international evidence is surprisingly mixed.
</P>
<P>
There are many estimates of the potential employment cost of Labour's
minimum wage. Most of them are based on model simulations of the UK economy.
</P>
<P>
All of them are, at best, semi-educated guesses; and probably not worth the
effort. No-one knows whether, or how, introducing a statutory minimum wage
would affect unskilled wages and employment.
</P>
<P>
International evidence is a better source of clues on the likely effects of
a UK minimum wage. The US, in particular, also has a large and highly
competitive service sector employing many women and young people at
relatively low wages. The federal government has increased the statutory
minimum wage twice in the past two years, most recently in April 1991.
</P>
<P>
Most US studies of the effects of the minimum wage over the past few decades
have found a moderately negative impact on employment, mainly among young
people. A recent study of the effect of extending the mainland minimum wage
to Puerto Rico in 1974 found a more dramatic employment effect. By 1980 the
federal minimum wage was 75 per cent of the average wage in Puerto Rico's
manufacturing industry compared to 43 per cent on the mainland. Its
unemployment rate rose from 11.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent between 1974 and
1983, of which over one third is estimated to be a direct result of the rise
in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
Yet a number of recent empirical studies of the effect of last year's rise
in the US minimum wage fail to support this traditional view. One of the
most careful, directed by Mr Lawrence Katz and Mr Alan Krueger of Harvard
and Princeton Universities, surveyed the wage and employment practices of
314 Burger King, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Texas in
August 1991. A third of them had also been surveyed the previous December,
before the higher federal minimum wage came into effect in April. Over half
of the restaurants had to raise the lowest wage they paid by the full 45
cent increase in the minimum wage. Only 5 per cent of restaurants were
already paying more than the new minimum.
</P>
<P>
The survey directly contradicts the conventional view that raising the
minimum wage prices people out of jobs. On average, the restaurants that had
to increase their wages by more tended also to have a larger increase in
employment, as the right-hand chart shows. Each dot signifies one
restaurant's growth of wages and full-time employment. There are many
outliers; but the upward sloping 'best-fit' line between the dots indicates
a positive, and statistically significant, relationship between higher
mandated wage growth and higher employment. A 10 per cent wage increase is
predicted to raise relative full-time employment by 25 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The survey does not suggest that raising the minimum wage increases
unemployment, at least among hamburger-flippers. One explanation is that
fast-food restaurants can impose below-market wages on their existing
employees but have to raise them to market rates in order to attract new
employees. Only when the government mandates this general wage increase does
expansion become profitable. But the result is not more skilled employment,
as Labour would have us believe. Moreover, the same argument would not apply
to internationally competitive industries; a similar study of textile
companies could well give the more conventional result. But the US evidence
does counsel against confident empirical generalisations.

Minimum Wage Amid Employer Protests

<P>
On the day the 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage became the law of the land nearly 50 years ago, a wave of pecan-shelling and tobacco-stemming factories closed throughout the South and industries warned of economic mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
Similar alarms are likely to be sounded today when Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D., Calif.), who head the Senate and House Labor committees, are expected to introduce legislation to increase the minimum wage from its current rate of $3.35 an hour to about $4.65 hourly over three years, with future automatic annual adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
If the wage is boosted, warns Anne Papa, a National Restaurant Association official, "employers will be forced to cut back on their work forces." 
But pressure is building among Democrats in a Congress they now control to raise the wage, which was last increased six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Says Rep. Hawkins: "The cost of living has gone up tremendously since the minimum wage was last raised. 
</P>
<P>
The value has been eroded." 
Adds Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio): "We haven't adjusted it for inflation for a number of years and the issue needs our attention." 
Prospects for passage look favorable. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to happen," predicts a Democratic House strategist. 
</P>
<P>
What's less certain is the shape the bill will finally take, and whether a veto is inevitable from a president who once said the minimum wage "has caused more misery and unemployment than anything else since the Great Depression." 
Republicans generally contend that the way to help the low-paid isn't by mandating higher pay and forcing some of them out of jobs but by expanding job training and education. 
</P>
<P>
Conceived as part of the New Deal, the minimum wage was heralded at its birth as "one of the most notable advances in our national effort to improve economic conditions in the United States." 
But inflation has taken a toll in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Congress last voted in 1977 to increase the wage; the last of four step-ups occurred in January 1981 when it rose 25 cents to $3.35. 
</P>
<P>
But while the wage has remained the same, prices have climbed 28%, according to economist Sar Levitan. 
</P>
<P>
He asserts that the inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage is now at the lowest level in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
The AFL-CIO calls minimum-wage workers "the have-nots of America." 
The labor federation has made the issue a legislative priority, arguing that an increase is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The minimum wage simply has not kept up with rising living standards and rising median wages," adds Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Attention to the issue is heightened at a time of national focus on welfare overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to support the work ethic, we have to give people a living wage," says Mr. Levitan, who directs George Washington University's Center for Social Policy Studies. 
</P>
<P>
He and others concede that increases in the minimum wage do result in some job losses. 
</P>
<P>
But they contend the extent is overstated, and partly offset by new jobs created by stimulated economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an increase will "eliminate a great deal of deprivation in the United States," he says. 
</P>
<P>
His research shows that income from the minimum wage was enough to raise a family of three out of poverty during most of the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Now, someone working full-time at the minimum wage earns $6,968 a year, or $1,773 less than the 1986 poverty threshold of $8,741 for a family of three. 
</P>
<P>
Only a worker living alone can make enough money at the basic wage to lift himself above the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
But many business groups think the consequences of another increase will be dire. 
</P>
<P>
It would "cost jobs . . . drive up prices and decrease services," asserts Mark de Bernardo, manager of labor law for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber claims that 644,000 jobs were lost as a result of the last minimum-wage increase. 
</P>
<P>
Employers say they'd have to raise wages for other workers, and costs would inevitably be passed on to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 70,000 small-business failures last year," says Mr. de Bernardo. 
</P>
<P>
"If we see a minimum-wage increase, that number is going to increase dramatically." 
Small businesses in the restaurant and retail fields fear the worst damage. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Goodwin, president of Reese Coffee Houses in Denver, sees nothing but "harmful effects." 
The last time the minimum was raised, he laid off the graveyard shift at one of his seven coffee shops to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I let those four people go and those four jobs have been lost forever," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that ripple effects affect everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Higher labor costs force employers to cut corners, and service suffers. 
</P>
<P>
"You go in a parking lot in Denver, there's never an attendant," says Mr. Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen an usher in a theater in 10 years." 
Counters Rep. Hawkins: "There's something wrong with a small business that needs this substandard wage to survive." 
About 61 million workers in a national work force of 120 million are covered by the minimum-wage law. 
</P>
<P>
They are generally those who are engaged in interstate commerce or produce goods for interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3.5 million hourly workers earn the minimum wage, according to the Labor Department, but it's expected that any increase would also benefit the nearly 1.5 million workers who are paid below the minimum and others who earn slightly above the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Who the minimum-wage earners are is a source of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Levitan's research shows that nearly 30% are heads of households and about the same number are teenagers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chamber of Commerce claims they are mostly teens entering the work force, students working part time, or adults supplementing primary family incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the chamber's Mr. de Bernardo says arguments about family poverty are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the head of the household who is earning minimum wage," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The historical goal has been a minimum wage equal to half the average wage for non-supervisory private workers, which is currently $8.88 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching a consensus among the bill's backers has been difficult as strategists try to balance the concerns of labor and other interests with political expediency. 
</P>
<P>
Considerations include what, if anything, might be palatable to the White House and what would draw enough support to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have warned they may counter the push to expand the minimum wage with a long-sought subminimum wage for teens, but an administration official says no decision has yet been made on its position on an increase.

 Reagan May Ease Minimum-Wage Stand
If Legislation Is Diluted, Brock Indicates

<P>
The Reagan administration may be willing to relax its opposition to an increase in the minimum wage if Congress agrees to dilute the legislation significantly, Labor Secretary William Brock indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Brock said in an interview that exemptions from the minimum wage would be necessary for youths who lack entry-level job skills and for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Congress would have to drop plans to tie future rises in the minimum wage to the average wage for all non-supervisory private workers after 1990. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress favors "those positive components, we can sit down and talk about it," the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
But the administration will remain opposed to any broad minimum-wage boost that results in "massive disemployment" of young people, he added. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first indication that the administration would be willing to bend its staunch resistance to any increase in the minimum wage, which hasn't risen for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, during the Senate Labor Committee's first hearing on a bill to boost the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour in 1990 from the current $3.35, Mr. Brock reiterated his opposition to an increase. 
</P>
<P>
He said boosting the level would worsen problems that many poorly educated, unskilled youths face in trying to find work in a more complex job market. 
</P>
<P>
"I am increasingly convinced that a number of people . . . are not only unemployed, but unemployable," Mr. Brock testified. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take a chance that we add to that problem" by boosting the minimum wage and thereby pricing young people out of the job market. 
</P>
<P>
In yesterday's interview, the secretary suggested the administration might accept a higher minimum wage, though perhaps smaller than in the pending bill, if Congress makes certain changes in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The administration has long supported a subminimum wage for youths, along with stressing the need for job-training and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Brock's suggestions for modifying the minimum-wage bill aren't likely to receive a warm welcome from congressional advocates for raising the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
They say the wage level has lagged far behind the increased cost of living since 1981, seriously eroding low-paid workers' purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
Most House Labor Committee members oppose any youth subminimum wage, the small-business exemption has foundered in the past, and wage-indexing must stay in the bill, a staff official for the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Labor panel and co-author of the minimum-wage bill with Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate committee, said that if Mr. Brock will put his ideas into a bill, the House committee will give it a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, it's too early to talk compromise, Mr. Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
But an aide to a Republican senator said: "Everybody is aware of the possibility" of a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people feel that some kind of increase in the minimum wage is inevitable," he said, so an effort is afoot to see how Congress can "do as little harm . . . and as much good as possible," while boosting the wage level. 
</P>
<P>
Some congressional labor experts said Mr. Brock personally would like to deal on Capitol Hill for a minimum-wage compromise. 
</P>
<P>
One congressional staffer concluded: "Apparently he's making some progress" within the Reagan administration.

<P>
Since Congress stopped raising the federal minimum wage in 1981, the U.S. economy has generated nine million new jobs at all salary levels. 
</P>
<P>
We don't think that is a mere coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those new jobs wouldn't be there if Congress had continued to dictate a minimum level of wages. 
</P>
<P>
Yet organized labor, which constantly asserts its interest in job creation, has made a strong pitch for the Kennedy-Hawkins "Minimum Wage Restoration Act," a bill that would head the minimum wage upward once more. 
</P>
<P>
More witnesses will be heard at a House hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
Worst news of all, Labor Secretary William Brock appears ready to compromise away President Reagan's soundly based opposition to the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
When politicians and unions promote laws such as Kennedy-Hawkins, they say they are legislating benefits for working people. 
</P>
<P>
Such arguments are based on either economic illiteracy or hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, a minimum wage prices the weakest members of the work force out of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A more candid union argument holds that increases in the minimum raises wage scales generally, but the truth of that is doubtful too. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, a study commission appointed by Jimmy Carter estimated in a 1981 report that every 10% increase in the minimum wage cost the economy 80,000 to 200,000 entry-level jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy-Hawkins proposes raising the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1990 from today's $3.35, and, more damaging, tying the minimum wage in future to the average wage for all non-supervisory private employees. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary Brock in June suggested the administration might go along with this scheme if youths are exempted and the indexing plan is dropped. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly the kind of wobbly position this administration should be avoiding. 
</P>
<P>
A few more such compromises and the economic credibility President Reagan has so vigorously established will have been wasted away. 
</P>
<P>
Senator Dan Quayle, a Republican, has calculated that two Democratic projects, the minimum-wage increase proposed for 1989 and mandatory health coverage, would add $1.49 an hour more to wage costs at the bottom of the income scale. 
</P>
<P>
That's more than a 44% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Employers on the margin will simply do without workers whose value doesn't justify a 44% cost increase. 
</P>
<P>
Senator Kennedy, of course, wants it known far and wide that he is helping the poor. 
</P>
<P>
He asserts that because the current minimum is so low it threatens new American poverty. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, just the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
Only some 5% of American workers today earn the minimum, compared with 12% six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
By and large, these are "secondary" and "tertiary" earners in households, many of them teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of the minimum-wage constraint on the ability of these extra earners to find jobs has relieved poverty, not increased it. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary Brock has said he won't concede on anything in the Kennedy package that will create job loss. 
</P>
<P>
That's nice. 
</P>
<P>
But does that leave anyone in government who is concerned about future job gains?

 Move in Congress to Boost the Minimum Wage
Revives Perennial Debate on Possible Loss of Jobs

<P>
Between 1978 and 1981, Congress raised the minimum wage four times. 
</P>
<P>
Over that period, total U.S. employment rose 9%. 
</P>
<P>
From 1981 through 1986, the minimum wage wasn't raised at all. 
</P>
<P>
And over that period, total U.S. employment also rose by 9%. 
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, those figures would seem to resolve the age-old debate over whether increases in the minimum wage cost the economy a significant number of lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet now, as Congress moves toward raising the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage for the first time since 1981, the battle rages just as hot and heavy as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives and business groups argue, as they have since the first minimum-wage law took effect in 1938, that employers will seek to cut costs by hiring fewer people - these days, especially the young and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Higher wages . . . for some will mean jobs lost for those workers who are trying hardest to break into the labor market," warns GOP Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce forecasts that the proposed wage rise, to $4.65 hourly over three years, with further increases later, would cause the loss of 1.9 million jobs by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, counters University of Pennsylvania economist Gerard Adams. 
</P>
<P>
He says the increase would affect the unemployment rate by less than one-tenth of a percentage point, and adds: "Estimates of dire consequences to the economy as a result of raising the minimum wage do not stand up to scrutiny." 
John Zalusky, an economist at the AFL-CIO, which is strongly pushing the minimum-wage increase, snaps: "The whole issue of job loss comes up every time, and there's never been any jobs lost." 
The labor federation notes that since World War II, employment actually increased each time the minimum wage was raised, except in the 1975 recession. 
</P>
<P>
The advocates of a higher minimum wage say increases are necessary to offset lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, the minimum wage was about 53% of the average hourly wage of a manufacturing employee. 
</P>
<P>
Now the minimum amounts to only 34% of the average manufacturing wage. 
</P>
<P>
No longer does the minimum wage keep all those who earn it above the poverty level: A full-time minimum-wage worker earns less than $7,000 a year, only 80% of what the government considers sufficient to keep a family of three out of poverty, and only 60% of what's needed for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
But for single workers, who comprise about two-thirds of all minimum-wage workers, the pay keeps them about 25% above the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over raising the wage used to focus on the effect on low-paid, male factory workers. 
</P>
<P>
But as the economy has changed, so has the group most affected. 
</P>
<P>
These days, most of those paid the minimum wage are minorities, women, and teen-agers or young adults just entering the work force, often in service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of boosting the wage floor argue that it is these jobs that are most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
With youth unemployment nearly three times the overall jobless rate and minority youth unemployment more than six times that rate, "the worst thing we could do is to exacerbate this problem," says Labor Secretary William Brock. 
</P>
<P>
"That is exactly what raising the minimum wage will do." 
Ronald Sarasin, a lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association, acknowledges that "we're going to survive" even if the the wage is increased, but warns of the consequences for low-paid workers: "This is less a business issue than a jobs issue." 
Yet such arguments are hard to prove, based on past evidence. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a 1970 report ordered by then-Labor Secretary George Shultz found that general business conditions are the main influence on teen-age employment, with only "hints" of an adverse effect from the minimum wage showing up in the data. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the staff of the Minimum Wage Study Commission, which was appointed by President Carter, estimated that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would trim teen-age employment demand by about 1%, and that rises in that wage have had little impact on overall unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Among adults, the commission found that if increases in the wage floor lowered employment at all - which it said isn't clear - the amount may be so small as to be undetectable with any precision. 
</P>
<P>
Studies about whether minimum-wage increases hurt, or help, black workers are "all over the lot," says University of Michigan economist Charles Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of raising the minimum wage insist that past increases have had a substantial effect in both layoffs and "disemployment" - workers not hired who otherwise would have been. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting last April, 29% of attendees said they'd trim their employment and 26% said they'd delay hiring if the minimum-wage bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
William Stone, president of Louisville Plate Glass Co., with 80 workers, says that if the floor is raised, "we have made the decision to pay our current employees overtime during peak workload times rather than hire additional workers." 
Valley Variety, an Ansonia, Conn., dime store that pays employees two cents above the minimum, would forgo its expansion plans for a second store, says owner Richard Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
In many areas, however, a growing shortage of new workers has resulted in more-generous wages for fast-food, retail and other jobs, making the minimum-wage question irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Philip Litman, owner of Bradford Stephen Inc., a Worcester, Mass., company with two gift stores, has seen the wage he must pay to get and keep help climb to $6 an hour from $4. 
</P>
<P>
"The minimum wage has no bearing on what we do - it's a forgotten issue," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And while the National Association of Manufacturers is part of the coalition opposing the increase, it doesn't even include the bill among its half-dozen legislative priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Many association members already pay well above the wage floor, explains Randolph Hale, a vice president: "It's an important issue, but it's not the end of the world." 
As a result of those conflicting pressures, Labor Secretary Brock is trying to forge a compromise between the White House and Congress, where the Senate Labor Committee plans to act on a minimum-wage bill this fall, while the House committee plans further hearings. 
</P>
<P>
In return for administration agreement to raising the wage, Mr. Brock says, Congress must also allow a "youth differential" wage that's lower than the minimum wage, so as not to discourage employers from hiring untrained new job entrants. 
</P>
<P>
He is also pushing to exempt small business from the wage-floor requirement, and wants legislators to drop a provision that after 1990 would tie the minimum wage to average manufacturing wages. 
</P>
<P>
But one way or another, an increase is almost sure to become law. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of voters for the Service Employees International Union in June showed 71% backing the wage-floor bill; in a Personnel Journal poll, even 60% of corporate personnel officials backed a minimum-wage increase. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, observes Iowa GOP Rep. Fred Grandy, a member of the House Labor Committee: "If members of Congress feel they can raise their own pay but not raise the pay of the average low-paid worker, they're mistaken."

 States Know Best What Labor's Worth

<P>
Congress soon will consider an increase in the federal minimum wage to $5.05 from $3.35 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the increase argue that a major impetus has been recent boosts in many state minimum-wage levels. 
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, nine states and the District of Columbia raised their minimum wage above the current federal level, and this year New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are considering doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, state and federal minimum-wage comparisons should be made with a great deal of caution. 
</P>
<P>
There are many loopholes in federal minimum-wage coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Certain occupations, including casual babysitters and most farm workers, are excluded as well as employees of small businesses and firms not engaged in interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
State minimum-wage laws are intended to cover these workers. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, if a state's minimum is higher than the federal minimum, the state minimum applies. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the quoted minimum wage for a state is often deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
Some states offer what is, in reality, a menu of minimum wages rather than a single minimum. 
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia, whose minimum of $4.85 is the highest in the country, actually has seven other "minimum wages," all of which are lower than $4.85. 
</P>
<P>
Workers in the retail trade and laundry industry, for example, receive a minimum of only $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the District of Columbia, like many states, has a subminimum, or "training" wage, of $3.35 for employees in some job categories who are under age 18. (Some states also have subminimums based on age, student status, approved internship programs or for new hires.) 
Moreover, 13 states have minimums below the federal level and nine have no minimum at all. 
</P>
<P>
Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05. 
</P>
<P>
A minimum wage of $5.05 would require even the high-minimum-wage states of California and Connecticut to increase their mandated minimums by 19%. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, both Republican and Democrat members of Congress from high-wage states will likely find it difficult to vote against raising the federal minimum wage, since raising it would equalize wage costs among states and increase the competitiveness of labor in high-minimum-wage states. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the different minimum-wage levels to a large extent reflect regional variations in levels of unemployment and labor demand, as well as costs of living. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living. 
</P>
<P>
California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages. 
</P>
<P>
Compare these unemployment rates to those of Alabama and Louisiana, states that have no minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Their unemployment rates are 7.9% and 12% respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage of allowing state or regional differences in minimum-wage levels is that the appropriate minimum wage for Connecticut might force massive layoffs in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming's minimum of $1.60 would be meaningless, even laughable, in Massachusetts, where most employers must pay well above the federal minimum wage to attract applicants for job openings. 
</P>
<P>
Because states are the best judges of local conditions, they are in a better position to set minimum-wage laws. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of a federal increase argue that recent state increases signal grassroots support of the current minimum-wage bill before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Yet 41 states are still at or below the current federal level. 
</P>
<P>
As Robert Martin of the Chamber of Commerce has pointed out: "Most states recognize that what you pay someone is determined by supply and demand." 
This is a lesson the folks in Washington could bear learning.

 Prospects Wax for Minimum-Wage Rise, Helped by Bush's Support for Increase 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prospects for enactment of the first minimum-wage increase in eight years have improved sharply in recent days, sparked by Vice President George Bush's call for a boost in the wage floor. 
</P>
<P>
Wage-increase bills were languishing on Capitol Hill only two weeks ago, with many members of Congress reluctant to support a wage rise in the face of heavy small-business lobbying and arguments that the increase would mean job losses. 
</P>
<P>
Also, proponents of the bills feared the measure would be watered down too much. 
</P>
<P>
But the tide began to turn when Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, voiced his support for a higher minimum wage soon after he was jeered by Portland, Ore., shipyard workers who have suffered pay cuts in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the Senate debating a minimum-wage bill on the floor, and House members more eager to follow with similar action of their own, "the national election dynamics have changed the whole issue," said Robert Martin, human-resources manager for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt a lot better a week ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A union official rated prospects for enactment as "next to zero" before the Bush remarks, but said they're now at least 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
"I only wish that {Mr. 
</P>
<P>
Bush} had spoken up sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, if he had, we would already have passed this bill," said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor Committee. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan, who had sternly characterized minimum-wage increases as causing unemployment, was quoted by the Detroit News last week as saying he and Mr. Bush were "in agreement - there could be some {minimum wage} increase because of inflation." 
The Senate took up the minimum-wage bill late last week, and backers and opponents alike said prospects are strong for Senate approval of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
And if the legislation's backers in the House like the Senate version, they'll move to have the House simply adopt it. 
</P>
<P>
Some conservative Southern Democrats were reluctant to vote for a minimum-wage increase and be left out on a limb by Senate inaction. 
</P>
<P>
But any Senate approval this week "takes that argument away from them," said Jay Butler, a spokesman for the House Labor Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest stumbling block is an attempt by the bill's opponents to add an amendment, offered by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), ranking minority member of the labor panel, that would allow employers to pay a "training wage" to new employees. 
</P>
<P>
That wage, 80% of the minimum wage, could be paid for 90 days, and its advocates argue that it's necessary to encourage companies to hire inexperienced workers who are just entering the work force. 
</P>
<P>
The training wage, previously called a youth sub-minimum wage, has long been pushed by the Reagan administration, and Mr. Bush said he wants it too. 
</P>
<P>
But the AFL-CIO and many other backers of a minimum-wage boost say the training wage is merely a way for employers to get cheap, entry-level workers. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Kennedy has offered a substitute amendment that would allow each employer to pay 85% of the minimum wage to as many as 12 full-time students, instead of the limit of six students set by current law. 
</P>
<P>
If the Hatch amendment prevails, a House labor panel staff member suggests the House may spurn the bill. 
</P>
<P>
But despite their dislike for the provision, some union officials indicate they might wind up accepting it, if they must, rather than let Republicans blame the Democrats for killing a minimum-wage increase. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill would boost the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour, which has prevailed since January 1981, to $4.55 an hour over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Pending House legislation would lift the wage floor to $5.05 an hour over four years. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions that would tie increases in the minimum wage to rises in average manufacturing wages after three years have been stricken from the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan administration officials have indicated that any increase would have to be smaller than provided in the measures, and Mr. Bush takes that stand too. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation's proponents say it's needed to raise the incomes of several million workers who are below the poverty line, and they insist that the majority of those earning at or near the minimum wage support or help support families. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents contend that not only would a minimum-wage rise cause sizable job losses, but that many minimum-wage workers are teen-age members of well-to-do families that don't need larger incomes.
