Media Groups Urge Solidarity With Hostages
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six organizations are asking news media around
the world to publicize the fourth anniversary of Terry Anderson's
kidnapping on Thursday.
``Today, March 16, 1989, the American journalist Terry Anderson,
41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press in
Beirut, entered his fifth year of captivity as a hostage in
Lebanon,'' said a statement that the groups asked broadcasters to
air and newspapers to use on their front pages.
</P>
<P>
The ``statement of solidarity with Anderson'' is from ``the
leading freedom of expression organizations in the Western world,''
Anne Nelson, executive director of the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Nelson said she also will read the statement Thursday at the
National Press Club in Washington during a news conference
announcing her group's ``annual attacks-on-the-press report.''
A speech by Vice President Dan Quayle on freedom of the press is
scheduled at the Press Club later Thursday.
``We call on President Bush and Vice President Quayle to use
every possible means at their disposal to bring Terry Anderson and
the other hostages home,'' Ms. Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
Other organizations urging publication of the anniversary
statement are: Article 19 of London; International Federation of
Publishers in Paris; the International Federation of Journalists in
Brussels; Index on Censorship in London; and Observatoire de
L'Information in France.
</P>
<P>
In a separate letter to its members, the 150,000-member
International Federation of Journalists said: ``On March 16, another
shameful date in the calendar passes _ the fourth anniversary of
captivity for American journalist Terry Anderson, who is held
hostage in Beirut.''
The IFJ asked its members in 37 nations to draw attention to the
plight of British journalist John McCarthy, who marked his 1,000th
day of captivity on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
The IFJ said it will place advertisements in Beirut newspapers to
urge the release of all hostages.
</P>
<P>
IFJ members also were urged to send letters requesting diplomatic
initiatives to the ambassadors of the United States, the United
Kingdom, Syria and Iran and to ``publicize the plight of the
journalists'' in union journals and national media.
</P>
<P>
In London, IFJ Secretary General Aidan White will be accompanied
by McCarthy's girlfriend, Gill Morell, and several trade union
leaders when they meet with U.S. Embassy officials.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Charles Dale, the president of the Newspaper Guild of
the United States and Canada, will lead a delegation to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
State Department in Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Strasbourg, France, Doornaert and French journalist Jean-Paul
Kauffmann, a former hostage in Lebanon, will meet with European
Parliament leaders to press for the hostages' release.

<P>
Terry Anderson spent a fifth birthday as
a hostage today, a grim milestone in his captivity.
</P>
<P>
His relatives and friends marked the event with a flood of
messages and with a Mass in Washington. Radio reports said
Lebanon's three television stations would screen a birthday message
from his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspapers An-Nahar and As-Safir and the
French-language L'Orient-Le Jour published English texts of letters
to Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press who was abducted March 16, 1985.
</P>
<P>
His sister, Peggy Say, wrote, ``In honor of your birthday on
Friday, we will be in Washington with other hostage families to
mark another sad year in which you have been denied your freedom.''
The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, made up of
colleagues from all over the United States, wrote: ``Please believe
that not a day passes when we do not think of you and pray for
you.''
The Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan said it was sending a
33-foot birthday scroll to Anderson signed by 59 journalists and
former colleagues in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Anderson was a member of the club during a working assignment in
Japan 1979-1981.
</P>
<P>
Prominent journalists, along with representatives of the State
Department and the embassies of Lebanon, Algeria and Syria,
attended a Mass in Georgetown University's Dahlgren Chapel, where
Mrs. Say said such ceremonies ensure her brother will not be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen seized the 42-year-old Anderson in Moslem west Beirut
after a game of tennis that had been a brief respite from his
reporting on Lebanon's civil war.
</P>
<P>
He has not held Sulome, born three months after the morning he
was kidnapped. He probably does not know that his father and
brother died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Anderson's fate now appears to be caught up in a power struggle
between Shiite Moslem radicals and moderates.
</P>
<P>
He was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad, a group loyal to Iran whose
name means Islamic Holy War. His abductors demand the release of 15
men imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, an American who
was acting dean of agriculture at American University of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
</P>
<P>
Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the
whereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year,
reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for their
comrades jailed in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A copy of the statement delivered to a Western news agency in
Beirut was accompanied by a photograph of Anderson similar to one
released Nov. 4, 1988, after his last birthday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was seen as a response to a declaration Monday by
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran that he would use its
influence to free the hostages if the United States released
Iranian assets worth up to $12 billion that have been frozen since
1979.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has refused to free the prsoners, but two members of the
group were released in February after completing five-year
sentences. The United States has said it will not negotiate with
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Anderson and Sutherland are among eight American hostages, most
believed held by pro-Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad issued its statement as the leader of Iran's
revolutionary radicals, former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, was on a three-week visit to Lebanon. He met with
prominent Shiites, including leading figures in Hezbollah, believed
to be the umbrella group for kidnap gangs.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear why Mohtashemi, Rafsanjani's main political
rival, came to Lebanon. But the trip underlined his power struggle
with Rafsanjani, leader of the comparatively moderate
``pragmatists'' who want to restore relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
A knowledgeable Shiite said privately the Islamic Jihad
statement was ``a clear indication that the hostage-holders are not
under Rafsanjani's control.''
Hezbollah appears to have split into factions, with the main
groups supporting either Rafsanjani or Mohtashemi.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani dismissed Mohtashemi after his election as president
July 28. The former interior minister's surprise appearance in
Lebanon quashed reports from Tehran that he was under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Mohtashemi returned to Tehran on Wednesday via Damascus, Syria.
</P>
<P>
Since he was kidnapped, Anderson has been allowed to write a few
letters to his family and occasionally to see Lebanese newspaper
and television reports about relatives.
</P>
<P>
American and French hostages who shared his captivity and were
released have told of his courage and fears, how he has defied his
captors and suffered the agonies of captivity.
</P>
<P>
His father, Glenn, and elder brother, Glenn Jr., died of cancer
in 1986. Released hostages said he did not know of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Anderson knows his daughter, Sulome, was born June 7, 1985, but
has seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed him
to watch on Lebanese TV, according to letters from him released by
the kidnappers.

Anti-Ershad Demonstrators Block Streets, Train Tracks
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators blocked
streets and train tracks today, halting most traffic in the capital
to press their demands for President Hussain Muhammad Ershad to
resign.
</P>
<P>
Stores and offices closed, apparently out of fear of attacks,
when what was intended to be a blockade of transport turned into a
general strike.
</P>
<P>
Groups of about 50 demonstrators staged sit-down strikes at
about two dozen rail and road intersections in and around Dhaka, a
city of 7 million people.
</P>
<P>
Many people walked to work. Even bicycle-powered rickshaws,
Dhaka's chief mode of transport, stayed off the streets.
</P>
<P>
Protesters paraded through the streets shouting ``Down with
Ershad!'' and ``Days of Autocracy Are Over!''
United News of Bangladesh said 4,000 police and paramilitary
troops were deployed in Dhaka. There were no reports of violence by
midday.
</P>
<P>
The blockade was the latest tactic in the campaign by opposition
parties to force Ershad to quit. At least eight people have been
killed by police since the current round of protests started Oct.
10.
``We are happy to see that the blockade has turned into a hartal
(general strike). This shows popular support for our cause,'' said
Suranjit Sengupta, a top leader of the Democratic Party. It is one
of eight parties in an alliance headed by the Awami League led by
Sheik Hasina, one of the country's main opposition politicians.
</P>
<P>
Ershad has dismissed the campaign against him as ``the work of a
handful of violence-mongers who are out to destabilize
Bangladesh.''
He was an army general when he seized power in a bloodless coup
in 1982. He later resigned from the military and was elected
president in 1986 in balloting that opposition parties, foreign
diplomats and journalists said was rigged.
</P>
<P>
He plans to seek another five-year term in elections scheduled
for next year. The opposition parties say they will boycott the
vote unless Ershad resigns and hands over power to a caretaker
government.

Anderson's Birthday Spent In Captivity, Report Says Waite To Be
Freed Soon

<P>
Lebanese newspapers published birthday
letters to American journalist Terry Anderson on Saturday, his 43rd
birthday in captivity. One newspaper reported that fellow hostage
Terry Waite will be freed soon.
</P>
<P>
Seven newspapers printed birthday greetings to Anderson from his
sister, Peggy Say, his youngest daughter, Sulome, and Madeleine,
Sulome's mother. They published the original English text so that
Anderson, who did not know Arabic when he was kidnapped, would be
able to read them if his kidnappers allowed him to.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper ad-Diyar, meanwhile, said British hostage Terry
Waite would be freed either ``by the end of this month or within
the first half of the coming November, at the latest.''
The short, front-page report attributed the information to an
unnamed security source. The conservative ad-Diyar is not known to
have special insight into the hostage issue, but the report was the
latest predicting Waite's release since Iran and Britain agreed to
restore diplomatic ties Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
Waite, 51, an Anglican Church envoy, was kidnapped Jan. 20, 1987
after leaving his west Beirut hotel to negotiate with
representatives of Anderson's kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
He is believed held by Islamic Jihad, the pro-Iranian group that
abducted Anderson.
</P>
<P>
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
</P>
<P>
His birthday was marked by his colleagues as well as local and
foreign journalists with a somber gathering at the Associated Press
bureau. It was held in Anderson's office, which his colleagues
refer to as ``Terry's Room.''
The staff sang ``Happy birthday, Dear Terry'' and blew out a
candle on a white cake.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers also published an Arabic translation of Mrs.
</P>
<P>
Say's open letter to the captors, pleading with them to release
Anderson and the other captives.
``I beg you to release Terry and the others for humanitarian
reasons. Please, in honor of his birthday, give Terry and the
others the gift of freedom this year,'' Mrs. Say wrote.
``His daughter Sulome, whom he has never seen, started school
last month. His daughter Gabrielle has matured from a child of 8 to
a young woman of 14,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
Along with Sulome's hand-written letter, some papers published a
pencil drawing by the child, who was born 83 days after her
father's abduction. The drawing showed happy children playing.
``To Dad. I love you. Happy birthday. I go to proper school. I
do work, tracing, art, math. I can write and read. I love you,''
Sulome's letter said.
</P>
<P>
Former Irish hostage Brian Keenan said after his release Aug. 24
that he had spent part of his four years in captivity with
Anderson, and he noted that Anderson has a photograph of Sulome and
was given letters from his family published in the press.
``Terry and myself would sit through those long nights and speak
with great pain and remorse and longing for his daughter,'' Keenan
said.
</P>
<P>
Madeleine, addressing ``My Dearest Darling Terry,'' wrote:
``Another birthday, another year, another letter. A question I
ask myself every day and the answer I always want to give is `soon,
soon.'''
In addition to Anderson and Waite, the Westerners missing in
Lebanon are five Americans, three Britons, two Germans and an
Italian.

Terry Anderson's daughter pleaded for the father she loves but has never known 
to come home today, the day Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The journalist's family, friends and colleagues somberly marked the anniversary 
with commemorations and prayers in Washington, New York and Cyprus. Yellow 
ribbons fluttered from trees, signs and poles in Anderson's hometown of 
Batavia, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, is 
the longest-held of the American hostages in Lebanon. All told, 18 Westerners 
are believed to be captives there, including eight Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Former hostages chained themselves to a tree in Paris to protest Anderson's 
captivity, and President Bush pledged to work for the hostages' release. 
(Photo, P2.) 
</P>
<P>
But no message was as poignant as the one on television this evening in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
In a videotape, Anderson's 4-year-old daughter Sulome appeared, wearing a green 
coat and riding a bicycle given to her at Christmas in Anderson's name. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the bike for Christmas, daddy. Thank you," said Sulome, who was born 83 
days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim faction in 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"I love you Daddy, come home, please come home. I love you Daddy. Come home. 
Send me to the circus," she beseeched. The videotape was made earlier in the 
week and shipped to the television stations in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese newspapers also published a letter today signed "Sulome and 
Madeleine," from the girl and her mother, Madeleine Bassil, who wait in Cyprus 
for Anderson's release. 
</P>
<P>
"The world without God is not the world, it's hell. A home without a husband or 
father is not a home, it's hell," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am always wondering if you have ever been able to read the letters sent to 
you on different occasions, or even if they were read to you to let you know 
how much we love you and how different and difficult life is without you," 
Bassil wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Bush pledged to pursue "all legitimate opportunities" to win the 
release of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to keep open lines of communications with all parties, including 
Iran, who have influence over hostage-takers," the President said in a letter 
to Peggy Say, Anderson's sister. 
</P>
<P>
Say met privately with Bush and his wife at the White House, then addressed a 
ceremony across the street at Lafayette Park. Directing her remarks to the 
captors of her brother thousands of miles away, she said: "You complain that 
your story has not been told and yet the man who would tell it has been chained 
to a basement wall for five years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to punish them. I don't want to hunt them down. I just want my 
brother back. But I'm not going to pay them for doing so," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not attend the ceremony, but said in a radio interview that "every day 
I'm President I have a heavy heart when I think of the hostages." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has declined to say he is optimistic that any hostages would be released 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass at St. Patrick's 
Cathedral.

ANDERSON'S KIN MARK HIS 5 YEARS AS HOSTAGE 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Family, friends and colleagues of Associated Press correspondent Terry A. 
Anderson gathered at Lafayette Park on Friday to mark an anniversary they had 
hoped to never see. 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, 1985, after playing an early morning tennis match with an AP 
colleague, Anderson was kidnaped from a Beirut street. 
</P>
<P>
Friday marked the end of his fifth year in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, both his father and his brother have died of cancer. He has never 
seen his daughter, who will turn 5 in June. 
</P>
<P>
The solemn ceremony, held across the street from the White House, also brought 
together the families of the seven other Americans who were kidnaped after 
Anderson and are still held in Lebanon. There were songs, prayers and 
remembrances, expressions of outrage and hope. 
</P>
<P>
But noticeably absent was any evidence that the hostages would be released 
soon. Just two weeks ago, anticipation of a possible release intensified when 
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said he saw the hostage ordeal "moving 
toward a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the mood has turned sour. The Iranian president openly 
mocked President Bush last week for having accepted a phone call, said to be 
from Rafsanjani, that turned out to be a hoax. The Iranian news media have 
begun referring to the hostages again as American "spies." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the terrorist group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the 
Liberation of Palestine released a statement threatening to execute three 
American professors who were taken hostage in 1987: Robert Polhill, Alann Steen 
and Jesse Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters Friday whether he had any optimistic news for the families 
of the hostages, Bush demurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get the hopes up through a lot of speculation and have them 
dashed down," the President said. "I respect the families too much to do that." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any breakthroughs we can report," added White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Iranian regime said they see no reason to believe that a 
hostage release is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"They use them (hostages) as a card to play for internal political purposes," 
said Alireza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for the Moujahedeen, the principal Iranian 
opposition group. "It's just not in their interest to release the hostages. The 
weaker the regime gets, the more they need them." 
</P>
<P>
Bush declined to appear at Friday's ceremony across from the White House, but 
he and his wife, Barbara, met for half an hour with Anderson's sister, Peggy 
Say. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Say, which she released, Bush expressed his "great sorrow at . . 
. your brother's merciless imprisonment." 
</P>
<P>
Bush told reporters: "I'm going to do everything I can to get those hostages 
out of there, sometimes privately, sometimes publicly." 
</P>
<P>
Say, who in the past has criticized U.S. officials over the lack of progress on 
the hostage issue, said she was reassured that Bush is doing all he can. She 
also said she had "faith" that all the hostages would be released "in the 
coming weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The Lafayette Park ceremony was sponsored by "No Greater Love," a 
Washington-based support group for the families of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow flowers were placed beside the names of the nine Western hostages who 
are known to have been slain in Lebanon since 1985. Then, young children came 
forth, one by one, carrying photos of some of the Westerners who are still held 
hostage in Lebanon. Including the eight Americans, they number at least 16. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass at St. Patrick's 
Cathedral. At press clubs in Tokyo, where Anderson worked for four years, and 
in Washington and Brussels, journalists gathered to raise a symbolically empty 
glass as a toast in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, former hostages Jean-Paul Kauffman and Roger Auque put on blindfolds 
and chained themselves to a tree outside the Iranian Embassy to protest 
Anderson's captivity. The two were among 10 French hostages released by their 
captors in Lebanon between 1986 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman and Auque were silent during their protest but said in a statement: 
"We have taken this action so people know how Terry Anderson is living at this 
moment. He is chained. He wears a blindfold over his eyes. He must be silent. 
This is how we were. This is how he is today." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Damascus, former President Jimmy Carter met Friday with Syrian 
President Hafez Assad and also expressed optimism about the fate of the 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"I see movement now . . . better chances than those I have seen for several 
years," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, local television stations marked the anniversary of Anderson's 
capture by playing a videotape of his daughter, Sulome. The child was shown 
demonstrating her ballet dancing and told her father: "I love you, Daddy. Come 
home. Please come home. Send me to the circus." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter published by seven Beirut newspapers, Anderson's wife, Madeline 
Bassil, told her husband that she and their daughter also feel like hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in as much captivity, Terry, only our living space is bigger here and 
it's shared by millions. . . . A home without a husband or father is not a 
home, it's hell." 
</P>
<P>
The families of the hostages have received little news of their condition other 
than an occasional - and often distressing - photo.

  LONG WAIT IS OVER
LAST U.S. HOSTAGE, ANDERSON, IS FREE AFTER 6 1/2
YEARS  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said American hostage Terry
Anderson had been freed today by his Shiite Muslim captors and was safely in
Syrian hands.;   The statement followed contradictory reports earlier about
the whereabouts of Anderson, who had been held 6 1/2 years and was the last
American hostage in Lebanon.  
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar, who oversaw the negotiations for the release of Western
hostages, said in New York that Anderson was with Syrian officials in
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, and heavy snow has delayed his transfer to Damascus.; 
"I am sure this is a technical problem. I think mainly due to snow, the usual
road they use to go from somewhere in Lebanon to Damascus," Perez de Cuellar
said.;   "I'm still hopeful it will take place today," he said, referring to
Anderson's anticipated arrival in Damascus and his hand-over to U.S.
officials.;   "He is on his way, and he is being protected by the Syrians, I
imagine, because I think he must be in the Bekaa Valley," the
secretary-general said.;   Earlier today, it was not clear where Anderson was,
despite reports from Arab and U.S. officials that he was released and turned
over to the Syrians.;   Anderson, 44, an Associated Press correspondent, had
said in a videotaped statement that he was to be freed. The tape, released
very early this morning by his captors, gave no indication when that would
happen. It was not known when the videotape was made.;   An accompanying
five-page Arabic-language statement from the Islamic Jihad group, which has
held Anderson for 2,455 days, also announced that he would be set free.;   In
the initial portion of the tape, Anderson read the Islamic Jihad statement in
English, which he said he did not agree with. Among other things, it denounced
the group's enemies and accused Israel of blocking the hostage-freeing
process.;   "This is the statement of my captors," Anderson said after reading
the kidnappers' statement. "Mine is only that with my release, and I hope soon
the release of the two Germans and all the Lebanese held in Israel, this
tactic (hostage-taking) will never be used again.;   "The causes of this
troubled episode are complex and difficult. It is these causes which must be
redressed and eliminated. The holding of innocent people by anyone solves
nothing," he added.;   Anderson, wearing a dark sweater and white shirt, spoke
in a clear voice. He appeared in good physical condition.;   At the White
House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials had no official word
that reports of Anderson's release were true.;   Anderson is the third
American hostage freed in three days.;   Eight other Westerners have been
freed since August, when the United Nations launched negotiations involving a
complex swap of Western hostages, hundreds of Arabs held by Israel, and
information about missing Israeli servicemen.;   "We are immensely relieved
that Terry Anderson's 6 1/2-year nightmare is over," said Louis D. Boccardi,
Associated Press president and chief executive officer, following the initial
reports of Anderson's release.;   "He has paid a terrible price for his
commitment to stay with his story. We welcome him back with warmth, affection
and the deepest respect for what he has endured," he said.;   As chief Middle
East correspondent, Anderson headed the Associated Press office Beirut from
1983 until he was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. Staff members uncorked
champagne today to toast his freedom.;   The Syrians had said earlier that
Anderson would be handed over to U.S. Ambassador Christopher Ross at the
Foreign Ministry.;   Anderson's daughter Sulome, born three months after he
was kidnapped, was driven to the U.S. Embassy with her mother Madeleine by
American officials. They had flown to Damascus from their home in Cyprus.;  
Anderson's estranged wife, Mihoko, and their 15-year-old daughter Gabrielle,
who live in Tokyo, declined comment.;   The hostage saga has been moving
toward an end for the United States amid changing political alignments in the
Middle East after the Persian Gulf war and the end of the Cold War, moves by
Iran to improve ties with Washington and skillful U.N. mediation.;   In all,
dozens of foreigners have been held hostage by Shiite groups in Lebanon since
1984. Of these, 11 have been reported or confirmed dead in captivity, 38 not
including Anderson were released or escaped.;   In exchange for the hostage
releases, the kidnappers were reported by Iran's Tehran Radio this week to
have been promised that they would not be pursued by the United States,
Germany or any other country.;   The hostage-holders have in the past few
years been isolated by the desire of Syria and Iran to improve ties with the
West.;   Iran, long the chief backer of Lebanese kidnappers, and Syria had
pressed amid shifting international alliances for the Western hostages'
freedom.;   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani is seeking to end Iran's
isolation and shed its image as an outlaw state that supports terrorism. The
Syrians, once the vanguard of Arab radicalism and a longtime Soviet ally, are
realigning with the West after the collapse of communism.;   This week's
releases follow by days Washington's payment to Iran of $278 million for
weaponry impounded during the 1979-80 Tehran hostage crisis. The weapons and
other Iranian assets were frozen by the United States in 1979. Tehran has in
the past linked hostage releases to the return of those assets.;   The U.N.
negotiations for the Western hostages are expected to ultimately involve
freedom for 300 Arab prisoners held by Israel and its proxy militia in
Lebanon. Israel seeks an accounting of four missing servicemen in Lebanon.;  
On Sunday, Israel released 25 Arab prisoners, bringing to 91 the number set
free since August and giving new impetus to hostage releases.;   The two
Germans still held are Thomas Kemptner and Heinrich Struebig. An Italian,
Alberto Molinari, is missing, but reports say he is dead.

  ANDERSON ARRIVES IN DAMASCUS - FINALLY
HOPES ARE REALIZED AS CAPTORS RELEASE LAST U.S.
HOSTAGE  
</HL>

<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Anderson, the last American hostage in Lebanon, walked free today of his
pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim kidnappers. His release ended a brutal saga that
kept 15 Americans in chains, left three dead and bedeviled two U.S.
presidencies.;   A flurry of contradictory reports early in the day about
Anderson's whereabouts mirrored the agonizing cycle of raised and dashed hopes
for release from his 6 1/2-year ordeal.  
</P>
<P>
It was a painful day for his relatives and friends.;   "It's been like a
big roller coaster ride about his release," Anderson's 36-year-old brother
John said from his home in Ocala, Fla. "But that's the way it's been for
almost seven years.";   He was handed over to U.S. officials in Damascus after
hours of delay apparently caused by snow in the mountainous terrain from
Beirut, Lebanon.;   Anderson, 44, was the third American hostage freed in
three days, and his release ended an agonizing drama for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Two Germans still are held in Lebanon, however, and U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar said his work would not be over until they are
released.;   He has led delicate negotiations involving a complex swap of
Western hostages, hundreds of Arabs held by Israel and information about
missing Israeli military personnel.;   Eight other Westerners have been freed
since August, when the United Nations launched negotiations involving a
complex swap of Western hostages, hundreds of Arabs held by Israel, and
information about missing Israelis. Two German hostages are still being held.;
The secretary-general said at U.N. headquarters that no deal had been made
by U.N. officials guaranteeing the hostage-takers immunity from retaliation.; 
In exchange for the hostage releases, the kidnappers were reported by Iran's
Tehran Radio this week to have been promised that they would not be pursued by
the United States, Germany or any other country.;   Confusion about Anderson's
whereabouts arose after a five-page Arabic-language statement from the Islamic
Jihad group that held Anderson announced today he would be set free, but its
wording was unclear as to whether he had already been released.;   Anderson
said in a videotaped statement released today by his captors to the Associated
Press in Damascus that he was to be freed. The tape gave no indication of when
that would happen.;   American, Syrian and Lebanese officials initially said
Anderson had been freed and turned over to Syrian troops in Lebanon. Later,
however, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said, "We hope he will be
released this evening - the sooner the better.";   The Syrians said Anderson
would be handed over to U.S. Ambassador Christopher Ross at the Foreign
Ministry.;   Anderson's daughter, Sulome, born three months after he was
kidnapped, was driven to the U.S. Embassy with her mother, Madeleine Bassil,
by American officials. They had flown to Damascus from their home in Cyprus.; 
Despite the delay, there was a mood of calm and optimism among friends and
relatives who gathered to greet Anderson in Damascus.;   Anderson's estranged
wife, Mihoko, and their 15-year-old daughter Gabrielle, who live in Tokyo,
declined comment.;   Anderson's release marks the end of the seven-year
American hostage drama in Lebanon, which brought an outpouring of public
support for the captives and put intense pressure on the Reagan and Bush
administrations to get them out.;   The hostage saga comes to an end for the
United States amid changing political alignments in the Middle East after the
Persian Gulf war and the end of the Cold War, moves by Iran to improve ties
with Washington and skillful U.N. mediation.;   The hostage-holders have in

  HOSTAGE NIGHTMARE ENDS
ANDERSON SAYS FAITH, 'STUBBORNNESS' SUSTAINED HIM
IN CAPTIVITY  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nearly seven-year-long journey through Beirut's heart of darkness ended
Wednesday for Terry Anderson, the longest-held of the Western hostages in
Lebanon, bringing almost to a close a chapter of Middle East history that
brought successive U.S. administrations to frustrated impotence before a
shadowy group of radical Muslims.;   Anderson arrived in Germany early today
and was reunited with the sister who campaigned tirelessly for his release.  
</P>
<P>
Peggy Say dashed forward and gave her brother a huge hug after he stepped
down from the helicopter at the U.S. Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden.;  
Anderson appeared minutes later on a hospital balcony with Joseph Cicippio and
Alann Steen, the other two American hostages freed this week.;   After a
daylong delay that U.N. officials attributed to snow-blocked roads, Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, had appeared
Wednesday before his colleagues at a press conference in Damascus, Syria, and
said, "You can't imagine how glad I am to see you.";   The 44-year-old
journalist, who was abducted March 16, 1985, by the Islamic Jihad faction of
Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite Muslims, looked to be in good health and said
he was sustained in his long ordeal by his companions in captivity, his
religious faith and his "stubbornness.";   "You wake up every day. You summon
up energy from somewhere. I don't know how," Anderson said as he continuously
searched the packed room in the Syrian Foreign Ministry for Beirut-based
friends and colleagues, waving and giving them the thumbs-up sign.;   At the
news conference in Syria, Anderson said his captors came to his cell Tuesday
afternoon with new clothes - the first new apparel he had worn in almost
seven years - and a pair of new shoes that were pinching his feet.;   When
asked what his last words were to his captors, Anderson said simply,
"Goodbye," and laughed.;   After the news conference, he met with Madeleine
Bassil, whom he was planning to marry when he was kidnapped, and his
6-year-old daughter, Sulome, whom he had never seen before Wednesday. In his
long captivity, Anderson had treasured a photo of Sulome that his kidnappers
allowed him to receive.;   Anderson was the ninth Western hostage to be freed
since August. His release came after months of negotiations led by a special
U.N. envoy, Giandomenico Picco, who dealt with Iranians, Israelis and the
Lebanese kidnappers.;   In Washington, President Bush, who called Anderson in
Damascus "to express the love and admiration that all Americans have for
Terry," said Wednesday he joined Anderson's family and friends "in their
happiness for his return to freedom.";   The ordeal isn't over;   But he said:
"While the American hostages have now been released, we cannot say the ordeal
is over. We call for the immediate, safe and unconditional release of all
those held outside the legal system in the region, including the two German
hostages.";   Muslim sources in Beirut and Iranian officials have said Thomas
Kemptner, 30, and Heinrich Streubig, 50, who were kidnapped May 16, 1989, are
expected to be released soon.;   Bush said the United States still wanted a
"full accounting" of all hostages who reportedly have died or been killed in
captivity.;   Bush called for the immediate return of the remains of Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins and former CIA station chief William Buckley, both of
whom were killed by hostage-takers in Lebanon. Higgins headed a U.N. observer
force and Buckley was stationed in Beirut.;   White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater criticized Iran, with whom most of the hostage-taking groups had
allied themselves, as "still a terrorist state," and insisted that the United
States had made no deals to gain the release of the U.S. hostages.;   In a
great mood;   Anderson appeared to be in an ebullient mood as he joked with
his questioners. Asked how he felt about being labeled the longest-held
Western hostage, he replied, "It's an honor I'd have gladly given up long
ago.";   Anderson wore dark slacks, a white shirt and a dark sweater. He also
wore a pair of glasses precariously perched on his nose with part of the frame
missing.;   He said his spirits were kept up by listening to British
Broadcasting Corp. newscasts on a radio provided by his kidnappers in the
later period of his captivity, and that he was particularly grateful for
messages from his family that reached him through Lebanese reporters.;  
Before he was released, Anderson read a videotaped message from Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The tape preceded him to Damascus, where it was handed to an AP reporter.;  
"Although we are closing the file of the captives," the statement declared,
"this doesn't mean the confrontation with the Americans and Israelis is
halted. The captivity of some persons is only one of the styles to confront. .
. . The war is going on.";   Anderson said he made clear that it was the
kidnappers' statement, not his, "but I thought it was worthwhile to listen to
what they had to say.";   The good news for the hostage in the statement was
brief but meaningful: "We're going to free our last captive, Terry Anderson,
thus folding this page in the hostage file before glorious Christmas."; What
he missed; Some of the events Terry Anderson missed during his time in
captivity:; (box)1985: Cruise ship Achille Lauro seized by Palestinians.;
(box)1986: Space shuttle Challenger explodes 73 seconds into flight.;
(box)1987: 37 sailors on USS Stark killed by Iraqi missile in Persian Gulf.;
(box)1988: 270 killed when bomb destroys Pan Am jetliner over Scotland.;
(box)1989: Powerful earthquake strikes Bay Area.; (box)1990: Reunification of
Germany completed.; (box)1991: U.S. launches attacks in Iraq and Kuwait.
