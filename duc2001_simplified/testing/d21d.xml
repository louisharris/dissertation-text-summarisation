Fire Breaks Out On Cruise Ship With 700 Aboard
</HL>

<P>
An engine fire broke out early today on a cruise
ship carrying more than 700 people in the Gulf of Mexico, but the
blaze appeared to have been brought under control, according to
officials and a nearby ship's captain.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, said Petty Officer Brian Lincoln, of
the U.S. Coast Guard's Miami office.
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off Isla Mujeres, a
Mexican island north of the tourist resort Cancun in the Yucatan
peninsula, said Coast Guard Lt. Jim Mazzonna in Miami.
``All we know is that the ship's captain ... is completely out
of fire-fighting equipment and has requested additional
fire-fighting equipment such as foam, water and CO2,'' said
Lincoln, referring to carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard cutters, the Canada Star cruise ship and the vessel
Vera Cruz stood by to assist in evacuating passengers, Lincoln said.
</P>
<P>
The Canada Star's captain, Jens Thorn, said later that the fire
appeared to have been brought under control, and there was no
reason to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Petty Officer Richard Esterline said 707 people,
including crew, were aboard the ship.
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian Star, owned by SeaEscape Ltd., offers daily
``cruises to nowhere'' out of its port in St. Petersburg, records
show.

Fire Disables Cruise Ship in Gulf of Mexico
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise
ship off the Mexican coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze and
the ship with 715 people aboard was towed to port.
</P>
<P>
The Navy cutter Vigilant escorted the 465-foot ship, the
Scandinavian Star, as a precaution, according to Chief Petty
Officer Luis Diaz of the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami.
``The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the Mexican
navy to Cancun,'' said Diaz.
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries from the fire, but a 71-year-old St.
</P>
<P>
Petersburg man who suffered a heart attack was in stable condition
and on his way home aboard a Coast Guard plane.
</P>
<P>
A second person who suffered a spinal cord injury was also
evacuated with the heart attack victim, but Diaz said that injury
also was apparently not related to the fire.
</P>
<P>
The ship was expected to arrive in Cancun late Wednesday or
Thursday. The 449 passengers will be flown to St. Petersburg, said
Jill DeChello, spokesman for the ship's owner, SeaEscape Ltd. of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian Star was on a 3-day cruise to Cozumel, Mexico,
and was returning to St. Petersburg when the fire broke out about 1
a.m. EST Wednesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
The crew sealed off the engine room and pumped in carbon dioxide
to put out the fire.
``They used all their CO2 and closed off the engine room,'' said
Diaz. ``Then they requested more assistance from the Coast Guard.''
The fire was already extinguished when the Vigilant arrived about
10 a.m., he added.
</P>
<P>
Ms. DeChello said the company did not know what sparked the fire.
``It will take a week before we know the cause and the extent of
the damage,'' said Ms. DeChello.
</P>
<P>
In August 1984, a fire struck the Star's sister ship, the
Scandinavian Sun, in the port of Miami, killing a passenger and a
crewman.
``I feel they are two totally different incidents that are in no
way related,'' said Ms. DeChello. She said the cruise line was
inspected by the Coast Guard and rigorously enforced all safety
rules.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's fire occurred as the Scandinavian Star was about 35
miles off Isla Mujeres, a Mexican island north of the tourist
resort Cancun in the Yucatan peninsula, the Coast Guard said.

NTSB Says Cruise Industry Safety May Be Below Par
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Safety standards may not be stringent enough in the
cruise industry, the chairman of a federal agency investigating the
March engine-room fire aboard the Scandinavian Star said Wednesday.
``The cruise ship industry is generally not operated under the
U.S. flag. You do have visits by the Coast Guard, but those are
paper certifications,'' said Jim Burnett, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
``There may not be sufficient safety standards,'' he said,
adding that his agency has probed fires aboard four cruise ships in
the past five years. ``The potential for loss of life is enormous.''
The March 15 engine-room fire aboard the Star, carrying 439
mostly American passengers, was discovered by a crew member as the
ship returned from Cozumel, Mexico to its Tampa home port.
</P>
<P>
Smoke detectors apparently failed, as did an automatic system to
douse flames. Also, the ship's emergency generators didn't work for
an hour, leaving the vessel without power in rough seas in the
Yucatan Channel, according to NTSB reports released as the agency's
three-day hearing opened here.
``Although there were no injuries or deaths, the failure of the
vessel's safety systems highlights the potential for a catastrophic
loss of life in this accident and future vessel fires,'' Burnett
said.
</P>
<P>
The safety board will examine whether the existing Coast Guard
procedures and international regulations are adequate to protect
passengers or whether more rigorous standards are needed.
</P>
<P>
Because the NTSB lacks regulatory authority and because cruise
ships are often registered outside the United States, he said his
agency can only make recommendations. These might have to be
followed up with congressional action or with new treaties with
nations where ships are registered, Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
The 465-foot Star, operated by Miami-based SeaEscape Limited, is
registered in the Bahamas. Its engine room was badly damaged by the
fire, and there was smoke and water damage throughout the
17-year-old French-made ship, which has since been repaired.
</P>
<P>
Burnett estimated damages at about $20 million, but SeaEscape
officials did not answer questions at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
SeaEscape lawyer Nils Linfors Jr. vowed to challenge in court
the NTSB's authority to hold such public hearings as Wednesday's.
</P>
<P>
Atissue is that the board does not permit cross-examinations and
contentions that the Bahamian-registered ship is outside the
agency's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
An NTSB report said the fire ignited when pressurized fuel
leaked from a line and sprayed against a hot engine exhaust
manifold. The leak continued for 13 minutes after the fire was
discovered, feeding the flames, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Because smoke detectors apparently weren't working, Capt. Peter
Schaab said he had to send an officer to the engine room to confirm
there was a fire.
</P>
<P>
Firefighting efforts were hampered when an automatic carbox
dioxide extinguishing system failed, and had to be operated by
hand. But the fire was contained to the engine room.
``There was no further spreading,'' said Schaab, who was praised
by Burnett for his 268-member crew acting quickly to move
passengers from ship discos, bars, shows and dining rooms. There
were no serious injuries to passengers or crew.
</P>
<P>
NTSB records show that between September 1987 and February 1988,
there were at least six leaks in fuel pipes that feed the engines.
</P>
<P>
The official analysis of the fire and any recommendations that
come out of the hearings will be adopted by the full NTSB board in
Washington later this summer.

Soviet Passenger Ship Catches Fire; All Aboard Reported Safe
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire broke out aboard a Soviet passenger liner
carrying French tourists on a cruise of the Mediterranean, but the
blaze was put out by the crew and no passengers were injured, Tass
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Shota Rustaveli was 25 miles off the island of Malta when a
blaze broke out in the auxiliary engine room, the official news
agency said.
``The blaze was put out by the crew. There are no casualties
among the passengers,'' Tass said.
</P>
<P>
It cited local news reports as saying the ship had docked at the
Maltese port of Valletta, and that its passengers had been offered
sightseeing trips around the island south of Sicily.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were expected to continue their voyage on another
Soviet ship, and the crew of the Shota Rustaveli was to make
repairs and bring the ship home, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
It was the second fire aboard a Soviet cruise ship in recent
months. On May 18, a blaze broke out on the liner Priamurye while
it was in the Japanese port of Osaka. Eleven Soviets were killed in
the Priamurye fire, and 26 others hospitalized in critical
condition, Tass reported. The ship was carrying 295 Soviets on a
youth cruise around Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
The cruise ship Song of America was forced to return
to port after an engine seized up and started a small fire, but no
one was hurt, the ship's owner said today.
</P>
<P>
The ship left Miami on Sunday with about 1,300 passengers on a
Caribbean cruise.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a few hours out of Cozumel, Mexico, one of its four
engines seized up, touching off a fire in the engine room, said
Royal Caribbean Cruise Line spokesman Rich Steck.
``Any time you have a fire it's a big deal, but it was quickly
brought under control,'' Steck said. The passengers were mustered on
deck while crew members doused the blaze, but then allowed to resume
the evening's activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 705-foot ship turned around and returned to Cozumel on its
remaining three engines to replenish firefighting supplies, Steck
said. Passengers stayed aboard, and the Song of America will return
to Miami on Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
All passengers will be offered early flights home, along with
full refunds or the chance to book another cruise, Steck said.

Arson Fire Hits Storage Room of Once-Grounded Luxury Liner
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone set a fire early today in a storage
room on the luxury liner Regent Star, five days after the ship ran
aground in Delaware Bay because of another fire that cut off power,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
No passengers were aboard and no injuries were reported in the 5
a.m. blaze, which was controlled within 90 minutes, said Patrick
McKee, a dispatcher for the city fire department.
``The fire on the Regent Star was started in a maintenance
storage room,'' said Lt. Jack Christmas, a fire department
spokesman. ``The fire marshal investigating has determined ... that
the fire was intentionally set.''
There were no immediate suspects and no immediate evidence to
indicate that the fire was linked to the earlier fire, Christmas
said.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-ton liner was on its way from Jamaica to Philadelphia
on Sunday when a small fire prompted a power loss, allowing the ship
to drift onto a sandbar.
</P>
<P>
The 885 passengers left the ship by ferry Monday, a day after
they were supposed to return. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
The liner was freed Tuesday, and the ship was then docked while
the Coast Guard makes safety checks. Thursday, Coast Guard Petty
Officer Ken Beatty said the ship passed all inspections and there
was no serious damage from the grounding.
</P>
<P>
The ship had been due to start on a two-day cruise later today,
but that was canceled after the second fire broke out, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has said it might be months before a final report
on the grounding is complete.
</P>
<P>
An hour after this morning's fire was controlled, about 300 crew
members sat or stood in small groups alongside the Port of History
Museum where the ship was tied up. Many still wearin the orange life
preservers they had put om when they abandoned the ship. Others were
sitting on the preservers.
</P>
<P>
Many of them said they didn't speak English, and one who did
refused to be identified and said he didn't know anything about what
happened.

  3,000 LEAVE CRUISE SHIP AFTER FIRE
1 INJURED IN PANTRY BLAZE ABOARD LUXURY LINER
MOORED IN PUERTO RICO

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 3,000 passengers and crew members were evacuated early Wednesday
from the Sovereign of the Seas, one of the world's largest cruise ships, after
a fire broke out in a pantry.;    One crewman was treated for smoke
inhalation, but there were no other injuries in the fire, which broke out when
the ship was moored in San Juan Harbor, Ports Authority spokesman David Rivera
said.  
</P>
<P>
"There was no panic," said passenger Tom Vento, 56, of Philadelphia. "I was
surprised that with so many people everyone was so calm.;    "At first, we
thought it was a joke, but then we saw that it was serious.";    The 14-deck,
800-foot luxury liner left Miami on Saturday for a seven-day voyage to La
Badee, a private island near Haiti; Puerto Rico; and St. Thomas in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Virgin Islands.;    Rich Steck, a spokesman for Miami-based Royal Caribbean
Cruise Line, which owns the ship, said it would return to Miami on Wednesday
night after a Coast Guard safety inspection rather than continue the cruise.
</P>
<P>
Passengers will be given a full refund, he said.;    In Washington, the
National Transportation Safety Board said a two-member team would meet the
ship at Miami to investigate the fire.;    The board has been concerned about
the potential for accidents in the cruise ship industry and has held hearings
around the nation. Last year, it placed cruise ships on its "most wanted" list
of safety improvements.;    Steck said the fire, which started in a pantry
between the fifth and seventh decks, apparently was caused by an electrical
problem, but no details were available.;    The fire broke out about 1 a.m.
and spread to the 1,000-seat Follies Lounge, which was closed at the time. It
took about 4 1/2 hours to extinguish the blaze, the Coast Guard said.;    The
2,318 passengers and most of the 818 crew members were evacuated to a nearby
port terminal before they were allowed to return to the ship at daybreak,
Steck said.;    The 74,000-ton Sovereign of the Seas is one of the world's
heaviest cruise ships and the largest in terms of its passenger capacity of
2,521, Steck said.

  SAFETY EXPERT EYES TIGHTER REGULATIONS FOR CRUISE
SHIPS  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'WE'RE in a race with a catastrophe," says Alan Pollock of the National
Transportation Safety Board of efforts to improve cruise vessel safety.;  
What he means, he explained, is that a cruise ship disaster would create
overwhelming pressure for new safety regulations, but he would rather take
preventive action.  
</P>
<P>
"Improved cruise ship safety is on the most-wanted list at the board," he
said.;   Sadly, it is true that major steps in ship safety have followed great
disasters: The General Slocum fire, which killed 950 people in 1904, brought
tighter requirements for life-saving gear and fire-fighting equipment; the
Titanic, with its loss of 1,500 lives in 1912, brought rules on life-saving
devices and certifying of lifeboat personnel; in the '30s, the Morro Castle
fire, which cost 124 lives, and the Mohawk sinking, with a loss of 45 lives,
brought regulations on the structure, equipment and materials of passenger
ships.;   The Andrea Doria crash in 1956, in which 47 died, inspired
requirements that ship hulls be divided by steel bulkheads.;   When the
Yarmouth Castle burned and sank in 1965, taking 90 lives, Congress banned wood
construction on passenger ships. And the International Maritime Organization,
a United Nations body with headquarters in London, enacted similar regulations
when it overhauled the Safety of Life at Sea code in 1974.;   Despite these
reforms and improvements, Pollock believes the cruise ship industry has been
lucky there haven't been more fatalities during the last decade.;   "We don't
look at fatalities as a measure of safety," he said.;   "We look at the types
of accidents that occur. Things may go OK under ideal circumstances, but
accidents don't happen under ideal circumstances.";   Pollock fears that
Congress, the Coast Guard and the International Maritime Organization are not
moving fast enough to mandate safeguards, despite 176 deaths last year in an
arsonist's fire on the Scandinavian Star ferry in Denmark, and the dramatic
images of the cruise ship Oceanos, which sank off South Africa early in
August, fortunately without loss of life.;   Safety experts are primarily
concerned with three issues: fire protection, particularly in the big atria of
new cruise ships, the ability of crew members to give safety instructions in a
language that passengers understand, and the aging of the world fleet of
cruise ships.;   American passengers frequently assume that any ship they
board in a U.S. port has met all Coast Guard safety requirements, a notion
reinforced by "Coast Guard approved" labels on most life jackets, and fire
systems on smaller boats and domestic ferries.;   In fact, the Coast Guard
gives four inspections a year to ships that dock in the United States, but
when the vessel is registered in another country, the Coast Guard only makes
sure the ship provides whatever is required by international Safety of Life at
Sea regulations: twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers and life
jackets for 125 percent of capacity, with the equipment in good condition.;  
Once a year, the Coast Guard observes an evacuation drill. If equipment is not
in order, the Coast Guard can prevent the boarding of passengers until things
are up to snuff.;   The application of the rules is not universal: the older
the vessel, the less stringent the requirements, because Safety of Life at Sea
rules have grandfather clauses.;   Age: no automatic alarm;   A vessel need
comply only with the rules in effect at the time the keel was laid or it last
underwent major reconstruction. When the rules were initially adopted by the
International Maritime Organization, it was assumed that older vessels would
pass out of service, but this did not happen, according to Marjorie Murtagh of
the Coast Guard, the U.S. fire-safety representative at the International
Maritime Organization.;   Of the 100 large vessels now operating from U.S.
ports - all but two are of foreign registry - 72 are more than 10 years old,
23 are more than 20 years old and 26 are more than 30 years old, according to
figures in the Coast Guard magazine Proceedings of the Marine Safety Council.
</P>
<P>
Thus, 70 percent of vessels visiting the United States need not meet the most
recent international rules, enacted in 1974 to cover ships built after May
1980.;   However, everyone who deals with these figures points out that age is
not an automatic indicator of an unsafe vessel. For instance, the Britanis was
built in 1932 of a steel design not required until after the Andrea Doria.;  
Rear Adm. Joel D. Sipes, former chief of the Coast Guard's Office of Marine
Safety, testified in Congress this spring: "We have been concerned for a
number of years that the grandfather clauses create an incentive to bring more
and more older ships back into service. We already see an aging of the fleet,
and a resurgence in refurbishment without safety upgrading.";   Death rate
falls;   However, the casualty rate on cruise ships has been low in recent
years. The National Transportation Safety Board in 1989 published a study of
36 accidents in 15 years on vessels that touched U.S. ports. Of the 176 deaths
listed, only five were aboard ocean-going cruise vessels under foreign flags.;
William A. O'Neil, secretary general of the International Maritime
Organization, fears that may change, partly because of the leeway the
grandfather rules give for refitting. "The average age of ships today is 16
years, which is already fairly elderly in shipping terms and old ships need
more maintenance and repair," he said in a statement last month.;   In May,
the safety committee of the International Maritime Organization met in London
to begin amending the Safety of Life at Sea rules.;   The proposed amendments,
which are supported by the majority of the member countries, require that new
ships' atriums have smoke-detection systems, smoke-exhaust systems, two means
of escape and an automatic sprinkler system.;   The committee also discussed a
phase-out of the grandfather rules. One peculiar gap in existing regulations
involves vessels built under the 1974 rules, which banned wood construction,
but for the first time did not require sprinkler systems.;   These vessels
would probably be among the first existing vessels required to install
sprinklers.;   Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the United States have entered
proposals to cover older vessels immediately, or to modify sharply the
permissive rules. Roger Kohn, information officer for the maritime
organization in London, said the loss of the Oceanos "tended to confirm a
general feeling that something must be done.";   John T. Estes, president of
the International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the owners of most
of the ocean-going cruise vessels, said that his organization favored all the
proposed new rules, but not the proposed effective dates.;   When the safety
committee met in May, it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations
beyond 1994 for new ships, possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service
of vessels that cannot meet the new rules.;   Estes said that accounting for
the lead time required for ship design, his organization favors 1996 for
enforcing the rules on new construction and major reconstruction.;   The 15
major cruise ships that call in New York have passed inspections without
difficulty, according to Comdr. Anthony Dupree, chief of the inspection
department of the Coast Guard in New York. In U.S. ports, he said, any work is
generally done quickly "because passengers are the lines' meat and potatoes,
and we can keep them from boarding.";   These inspections, done every three
months, should assure passengers, according to Lieut. Comdr. John J. O'Brien
Jr., the Coast Guard's deputy chief.;   "If you fly to another country to save
a few dollars," he said, "let the buyer beware; you don't know if it's been
inspected in the last year, or at all.";   On the other hand, when
U.S.-registered vessels are inspected, O'Brien said, they are required to meet
full Coast Guard standards, including expensive Type I life vests designed to
be very easy to use. But there are only two U.S.-flag vessels in the cruise
trade - American Hawaii Cruises' Independence and Constitution, operating in
Hawaii.

 U.S. Assails Safety of Cruise Ships as Dubious at Best

<P>
In their ads, cruise ships are the picture of fun-in-the-sun vacationing on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the U.S. government, the sailing could be treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.'s 700-foot Celebration, registered as a Liberian ship, cut a Cuban freighter in half in a collision off Cuba, killing three Cuban sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival officials acknowledged that nobody was watching the radar at the time, but have refused to cooperate with a U.S. investigation, despite federal subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
In March 1988, an engine fire broke out on SeaEscape's Bahamian cruise ship, the Scandinavian Star, as it headed to St. Petersburg, Fla., from Cozumel, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Automatic fire extinguishers and the emergency generator failed, plunging much of the smoke-filled ship into darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Because many of the crew members spoke no English, they offered little help to the terrified passengers. 
</P>
<P>
One vacationer had to show a crew member how to pull a fire alarm. 
</P>
<P>
In a voluminous report issued yesterday, the National Transportation Safety Board said these and other incidents carry a clear warning: Many foreign-flag cruise ships that sail from U.S. ports have serious safety problems and the potential for a catastrophic accident is significant. 
</P>
<P>
"A little bit of laxity," warns James Burnett, a member of the board, "could cost you {the lives of} 1,200 people." 
The board, in sweeping recommendations, is seeking both legislation and voluntary cooperation from the industry to improve cruise-ship safety, which it says is marred by the less-than-exacting rules governing foreign-flag carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign-registered vessels make up the vast majority of cruise ships sailing from U.S. ports and catering to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"If these companies are going to have their fleets based in the U.S. and carry primarily U.S. passengers, then they should meet U.S. standards," says one safety board staffer.

An industry spokeswoman says the cruise-ship companies welcome any safety suggestions but question the need for more regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Orban, a spokeswoman for Cruise Lines International Association, a New York-based group that has 35 members, notes that only two people have been killed on cruise ships serving U.S. ports since 1970. (Both were passengers on the Scandinavian Sun, another Bahamian ship, when it caught fire in August 1984.) "When you look at that track record, it speaks for itself," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know any record that's better." 
But as the booming cruise-ship industry plans ever larger ships - some on the drawing boards could carry well over 3,000 people - the safety board's concerns are rising. (Many cruise ships now carry fewer than 1,000 people.) Ships operating from U.S. ports carried about five million passengers last year, and in anticipation of continued growth, 20 cruise ships are under construction around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Most will ply their trade as foreign-flag carriers in U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
The problems, the safety board said, include inadequate fire-fighting equipment and crew training, language barriers and lax accident reporting and investigating. 
</P>
<P>
But the overriding concern, the board said, is that foreign cruise ships are subject to rules that are less stringent and vigorously enforced than those imposed on U.S. flag vessels. 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans hoping for a bon voyage wrongly assume that ships sailing from U.S. ports operate under the supervision of the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
But almost all cruise ships operating out of the continental U.S. sail under foreign flags, and the U.S. Coast Guard conducts only cursory inspections of foreign vessels. 
</P>
<P>
At least 80 foreign cruise ships operate out of U.S. ports, mostly from southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them sail under the so-called flags of convenience of Liberia, Panama and the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
There are only three U.S. flag cruise ships and they operate in the Hawaiian Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Fire is considered the most deadly threat for cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
The board said there have been at least nine fires on foreign-flag cruise ships in recent years, several of them serious. 
</P>
<P>
In July 1986, an acetylene-fueled fire erupted in an engine store room on the Panamanian cruise ship Emerald Seas as it was approaching the Berry Islands in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, two explosions rocked the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ventilation system, instead of shutting down, pumped black smoke into the state rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one people were treated for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Language problems aggravate the safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
During an emergency drill on the Bahamian vessel Tropicana, the U.S. Coast Guard saw that the Polish officers had trouble communicating with a lifeboat launch team who spoke Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard had to conduct several drills before the ship was permitted to leave port. 
</P>
<P>
The location of life jackets is another issue. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 Scandinavian Star accident, passengers were given conflicting information about whether they should go to their cabins or emergency gathering stations to get their life jackets. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, passengers tried to fight their way through smoke-choked hallways to get back to their cabins to get their safety jackets. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the chances of a cruise-ship disaster, the safety board is pushing for legislation that would give the U.S. Coast Guard the authority to enforce U.S. safety rules on foreign-flag vessels. 
</P>
<P>
"The Coast Guard," says Board Chairman James Kolstad, "needs more teeth" to ensure that the vessels are safe when they leave American ports. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the board believes the ships should be required to have sophisticated, integrated fire-control systems, including remote fire door releases and fire alarms. 
</P>
<P>
The board also wants cruise-ship companies to install floor-level emergency lights like those on airplanes and to hire a full-time marine firefighter on all vessels with more than 500 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
And it believes that at least 75% of the crew involved in emergency operations should be able to communicate with each other and the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its strongly worded report, the NTSB knows it could be years before the safety standards for cruise ships are upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, one staff member says, "at least the public can be made aware, when they walk their family across that gangplank, what kind of environment they are going into."
