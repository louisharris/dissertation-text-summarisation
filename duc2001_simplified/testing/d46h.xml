Kerr-McGee Shuts Down Rocket Fuel Plant
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only remaining U.S. manufacturer of a
crucial space shuttle fuel component announced a halt in production
until it can be shown the factory is safe after explosions leveled
another plant last week.
</P>
<P>
Kerr-McGee Corp. made Thursday's announcement in the face of
state pressure.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the demolished plant's operator said a leaking
natural gas line was responsible for the series of earthquake-force
blasts May 4, which killed two people, injured 326 and did an
estimated $73 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
The report by Pacific Engineering and Production Co. was
challenged by Southwest Gas Corp., which said the line ruptured
after the explosions, not before.
</P>
<P>
Kerr-McGee said it would suspend production of ammonium
perchlorate, an oxidizer for solid fuel used in the space shuttle
and military rockets, until an independent inspection shows the
plant is safe.
</P>
<P>
Paul Gaines, the company's director of governmental relations,
said he hoped production could resume within a few days.
``A prolonged shutdown is not helpful to any of us,'' Gaines
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the company has already contracted with a safety
consultant to study the plant, and the inspection could begin by
Monday. Gaines said the plant will continue making other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Gov. Richard Bryan announced the shutdown after company
officials agreed late Thursday morning to the halt. Bryan said
``legal work was being prepared'' to force Kerr-McGee to suspend
production before it agreed to the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
Local and state officials had expressed outrage when the plant
resumed production Tuesday of ammonium perchlorate, particularly
since last week plant officials said they would wait until
authorities determined the cause of the blast before reopening.
</P>
<P>
Kerr-McGee and Pacific were the only two plants in the country
to manufacture ammonium perchlorate, and National Aeronautics and
Space Administration officials have said the explosion could delay
the space shuttle program..
</P>
<P>
Pacfic Engineering Chairman Fred Gibson said Thursday that a
large natural gas line passing through the plant had been leaking
for at least 30 minutes before the first fire broke out at his
company's plant.
``The massive gas leak is believed to have saturated the earth
below the paved surfaces of the ... plant and to have ignited at
the point of origin as a result of circumstances unrelated to
(plant) operations,'' Gibson said.
``All of the subsequent destructive events were caused by the
gas leak, the gas fire and the gas explosion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Southwest Gas spokesman Dennis Hetherington disputed the report.
``As far as we're concerned, our facilities are a victim of the
explosion and not the cause,'' Hetherington said.
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Roy Parrish said the fire department would withhold
judgment until it completes its own investigation.

Couple Gets $11.5 Million Award For Natural Gas Explosion
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Illinois Power Co. has agreed to pay
$11.5 million to a couple critically injured in a natural-gas
explosion in their home two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In a settlement reached Monday, the utility company agreed to pay
Jerry Sickmeier, 33, and Lisa Jines, 26, $10 million in damages and
$1.5 million for medical expenses, said the couple's attorney, C.E.
</P>
<P>
Heiligenstein.
</P>
<P>
Both sustained burns on over 80 percent of their bodies in the
Dec. 7, 1986, explosion at their home in Cahokia, a St. Louis
suburb. They now live in nearby Belleville.
</P>
<P>
The settlement was reached on the day a trial in the case was
scheduled to begin.
``They are much relieved that this financial ordeal is over with
and that they can have some lifetime financial security,''
Heiligenstein said. ``Both suffered severe burns and have severe
limitations in the limbs.''
Heiligenstein said neither has worked since the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Illinois Power spokeswoman Barbara Lillyman said the utility had
no comment on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The couple alleged that Illinois Power was negligent when it
allowed a natural-gas pipe to deteriorate to the point that it
ruptured. Gas from the pipe traveled through sewer lines into the
home's utility room and was ignited by the pilot light of a
hot-water heater, they said. The explosion occurred as police were
awakening area residents and telling them to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Sickmeier was treated for seven months at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston for third-degree burns that covered most of his
body. He also suffered burns in his lungs and spent more than two
months on a respirator.

Natural Gas Explosions Level Houses In Suburb Near Chicago
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Natural gas explosions that leveled two
homes and damaged a third in two days were called a coincidence by
utility officials, but some residents remain unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
Northern Illinois Gas Co. crews reported finding nothing unusual
Monday while scouring more than 100 homes and a school within a mile
radius of the explosions Thursday and Saturday in this town of
17,000 about 60 miles northwest of Chicago.
``It's just a coincidence. No relationship exists between the two
explosions,'' said utility spokesman Bob Edwards.
</P>
<P>
There were no serious injuries, but some residents remain uneasy.
``I was really, really upset. I couldn't sleep last night,'' said
Angela Carparelli, who lives in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
One house was leveled following an explosion on Thursday and more
explosions on Saturday destroyed one house and knocked another off
its foundation.
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Richard Nebel said it will probably take investigators
weeks to determine the causes of the blasts.
``The leaks we know of have been stopped,'' Nebel said late
Monday. ``We are taking test bores and no leaks or vapors have been
found today.''
Jerry and Becky Rentschler, whose home was destroyed Saturday,
said they almost left their youngest children _ Shelly, 13, and
Matthew, 11 _ home while they went away for the weekend. They
changed their minds at the last minute.
``I saw aluminum siding flying through the air and all of a
sudden there was this big flame,'' said 12-year-old Lisa Bernau, who
saw the Rentschlers' house explode. ``It was so scary.''
Minutes after another neighbor went outside to see what happened,
the neighbor's house was blasted from its foundation, said Nebel.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, James Steurer, 79, was sitting on his bed tying his
shoes when a gas explosion leveled his house and sent him and the
mattress flying into the driveway. He suffered only cuts and
scratches, noting ``absolutely, I'm lucky.''
In addition to being two days apart, the explosions were at sites
about six blocks apart and in houses fed by two separate gas lines,
Nebel said.
</P>
<P>
Government and utility officials insist there is no need for
residents to worry.
``It's one of those rare things of Mother Nature or the man
above,'' said investigator Terry Pitkus of the state fire marshal's
office.

Ottawa Apartment Building Hit by Explosion
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An explosion in a 12-unit, three-story apartment
building less than a mile from Parliament killed a man on Thursday
and injured three people, sending rubble flying a full block away.
</P>
<P>
Police believed the explosion was caused either by natural gas or
propane.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they smelled gas immediately after the blast at
about 9:30 a.m., but there was no confirmation the explosion was
caused by a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the explosion, firefighters rescued a middle-age
woman trapped inside her apartment. She was taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Civic Hospital
earlier. One man, not identified, was pronounced dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
A dog brought in by police searched for more possible victims.
</P>
<P>
Flying debris damaged cars and nearby downtown buildings.
</P>
<P>
Bill Maxwell, the landlord of two nearby buildings, said the
explosion sent ``huge chunks of concrete, the size of television
sets'' hurtling through the air.
</P>
<P>
Cab driver Steve Legault was returning to his nearby apartment
when he heard the blast. As he ran toward the building, he
encountered a dazed and bleeding woman.
``She was delirious and was crying that her 7-year-old son was
still in the apartment.''
Legault said he ran into the building and saw a man lying halfway
out of a doorway in a pool of blood.
``He was covered with blood and his head had deep cuts in it. I
checked and I think he was dead.''
John Kalina, 36, who lives one block north, said the explosion
``sounded like someone was kicking our door in.''
The building is in a fashionable neighborhood of renovated older
homes, townhouses, boutiques and restaurants.

<P>
Motel guests jumped out of windows and
lowered themselves to the ground using bedsheets to escape fire
from an explosion apparently caused by a natural-gas leak that
killed four and injured 10.
</P>
<P>
A night desk clerk was investigating reports of a gas leak at
the 62-unit Super 8 Motel when the explosion occurred early Sunday,
officials said.
``I had just gotten up to go to the bathroom and had come back
and my wife said, `Don't you smell the gas?''' said Neal Woodrick,
60, of Trenton, N.J. ``And then it happened.''
``It sounded just like a bomb had gone off _ boom,'' said his
wife, Joan Woodrick, 58.
</P>
<P>
Fire officials were to comb the charred remains of the motel
today for clues to the explosion.
</P>
<P>
All of the 45 to 50 guests were believed to be accounted for,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters used a crane, pitch forks and shovels to sift
through piles of charred mattresses, carpet, pink insulation and
dry wall left from the fire and explosion, which threw debris as
far as 300 feet from the building.
``I'm almost positive it was a natural gas explosion,''
Hagerstown Fire Chief Gary Hawbaker said. ``The whole front of the
building _ first, second and third floors _ was blown out. That
whole chunk was engulfed.''
Hawbaker said there was a natural gas line in the middle of the
fire, ``so we couldn't put out the rest of the fire until the gas
was shut off.'' It took firefighters about 30 minutes to shut off
the gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Joan Ganje-Fischer, a spokeswoman for Super 8 Motels Inc. of
Aberdeen, S.D., said that after a guest told the clerk that gas was
leaking from the laundry room area, the gas company told the clerk
to try to turn the gas off.
``He was right in the center of the explosion when it
happened,'' she said. ``He came back to the front desk and his hair
was on fire. He put his hair out with a towel, pulled the alarm
notifying the guests, called 911 and then began evacuating the
motel.''
Donald Lee, 39, of Shorewood, Wis., said he awoke, put on pants,
a shirt and a coat and jumped 12-15 feet out of a second-story
window, breaking his wrist in the fall.
``I heard screaming and glass breaking,'' he said. ``A number of
people saw flames. A family had their hair singed.''
Some guests were moved to a motel across the street, and the Red
Cross provided food, clothing and shelter.
</P>
<P>
The dead were identified as James G. Scharnek, 34, of Milwaukee,
Wis.; Kristoddie Brown, 25, of Capital Heights; Mercedes Keyes, 26,
of Hagerstown; and Margretta E. Parker, 70, of Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
Ten people were treated at Washington County Hospital for smoke
inhalation and minor injuries and were released, spokesman John
Costopoulos said.

One Dead Reported in Gas Well Explosion
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>HEIDELBERG, Miss. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An explosion blasted a natural gas well
Tuesday in southeastern Mississippi, killing at least one worker
and critically burning four others, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
A two-mile area around the well was evacuated, affecting about
145 people.
</P>
<P>
Authorities initially evacuated only those within a half-mile,
but expanded the plan after the fire went out by itself and then
re-ignited, for fear that winds would scatter poisonous hydrogen
sulfide gas.
</P>
<P>
The gas is naturally associated with some gas fields.
</P>
<P>
Experts at capping gas wells were to fly in Tuesday night. The
explosion occurred at about 2 p.m., authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The rig collapsed in the initial burst of what sounded like four
successive explosions, said Alex Thomas, who lives within a
half-mile of the rig. Others said there was another explosion later
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jim Maher, director of the Mississippi Emergency Management
Agency in Jackson, said officials intended to keep the gas escaping
from the well afire to burn off the poison.
``What they are going to do is bring a flame thrower-type device
to keep the well burning,'' Maher said.
</P>
<P>
Roads were closed leading to the well, which is about 75 miles
southeast of Jackson, as was a five-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 11.
``Until we get a firm handle on this and somebody that can tell
us with absolute certainty what is going on there, we will continue
to take extreme precautions,'' said Mississippi Emergency
Management Agency spokesman Dusty Perkins.
</P>
<P>
Perkins said the rig was known as Travis No. 3 and was owned by
R
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
H Oil and Gas Inc. of Tickfaw, La.
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Debbie Logan identified the dead man as Dwayne
Kennedy of Heidelberg. His age and exact job were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
The four burn victims were in critical condition and would be
moved to burn units in Greenville and in Mobile, Ala., said Lafe
Jones, a spokesman for the South Central Regional Medical Center in
Laurel. A fifth worker was treated for minor injuries and released.

Southern Natural Gas Co. Agrees to Pay $300 Million for ARCO
Explosion
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>ANDERSON, Texas (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Natural Gas Co. has agreed to
pay ARCO Oil and Gas Co. more than $300 million for damages that
resulted from an explosion on an ARCO drilling platform in the Gulf
of Mexico last year.
</P>
<P>
The March 19, 1989, blast and resulting fire killed seven
people, injured 23 and destroyed the platform. The blast occurred
while workers for Southern Natural Gas were attempting to make
repairs on the platform.
</P>
<P>
Representatives agreed on the settlement Monday during a recess
in a civil trial that began June 11 in State District Court in
Madison County.
</P>
<P>
They presented the agreement to Judge Bill McAdams while he was
holding court in neighboring Grimes County.
``We feel we've been adequately compensated for our losses,''
said Don Riddle, lead counsel for ARCO.
``Aside from Pennzoil, it's the largest settlement around as far
as anybody knows,'' Riddle told the Bryan-College Station Eagle.
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil Co. in 1984 won a $10.3 billion judgment against Texaco
Inc. after claiming that Texaco had broken up its deal to buy Getty
Oil Co. Texaco agreed to settle the case for $3 billion in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Houston attorney Randy Wilson, one of about 20 attorneys
representing Southern Natural Gas, declined to comment on the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
According to the settlement, Southern Natural Gas made no
admission of guilt but agreed to pay ARCO $300.5 million by Aug. 6,
and to pay a total of $500,000 to three ARCO employees injured in
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
ARCO was a party to several lawsuits pending against Southern
Natural Gas in federal court in Louisiana. The settlement will end
those suits, Riddle said.
</P>
<P>
The settlement will be paid by the gas company's insurance
carriers, primarily Lloyd's of London, Riddle said.
</P>
<P>
ARCO had asked for between $250 million and $325 million in
actual damages and $5 billion in exemplary damages resulting from
the explosion on a drilling platform about five miles south of the
mouth of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
In addition to damage to the platform itself, ARCO claimed it
lost about $200 million in profits from oil and natural gas sales
because the destroyed platform was crucial to a seven-platform oil
field.
</P>
<P>
Southern Natural Gas bought natural gas from ARCO and
transported it to shore by means of pipeline running from the
platform. The explosion occurred when subcontractors hired by the
gas company cut into the pipeline while trying to make repairs.

<P>
A natural gas explosion rocked an apartment
complex at an Army base, killing a 5-year-old girl and injuring 17
residents and rescuers, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The girl's remains were discovered in the rubble of the building
at 9:30 a.m. today, about 12 hours after it blew up, officials at
Fort Benjamin Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred hours after fire authorities arrived to
investigate a gas leak at another building in the complex. That
building was being evacuated when the blast hit several hundred
feet away, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, in a housing area for enlisted personnel,
destroyed a four-family housing unit and damaged another unit, said
post spokesman Maj. Ronald Downing.
``The fire engines were trying to get in and we were trying to
get out. It was total chaos,'' said Joan Adams, a resident of the
complex. She described people running through streets in their
pajamas, carrying children.
</P>
<P>
At least 17 residents and firefighters were injured. By midday
today, three people were still listed in critical condition, one of
them a 4-year-old girl, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Marion County Deputy Coroner Charles W. Green said he could not
conclusively identify the dead child until after dental records
were checked. But base officials said there was little doubt it was
the 5-year-old girl who had been reported missing earlier.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and police called off their search through the
smoldering rubble after the body was found. The girl's identity was
not released. Other members of her family were among the injured,
Downing said.
</P>
<P>
The post on the edge of town serves as a processing center for
soldiers en route to the Persian Gulf, although none of those
soldiers stayed in the affected area.
</P>
<P>
Fire authorities had been called in about 5:45 p.m., or 3{ hours
before the blast, after people reported smelling gas, Downing said.
</P>
<P>
He said officials had planned to evacuate the 240-unit Harrison
Village complex before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Harley said authorities turned the gas off at one housing unit
where they thought the leak was occurring. But a nearby unit, where
the gas had not been turned off, blew up, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some residents complained that they were not adequately warned.
</P>
<P>
Adams, whose husband is a sergeant, said that about two hours
before the explosion, military police began telling residents that
a gas leak had been found elsewhere in the complex and would be
fixed.
``He told us there was no danger for us to stay there,'' she
said. Her family had planned to leave anyway, because the complex
was without heat and hot water, but the explosion happened before
they did so, she said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Bill Carey, provost marshal, said the building where
the leak was detected was evacuated as a precaution, but ``we
didn't feel the whole area needed to be evacuated.''
However, the blast occurred in another building about 800 to
1,000 feet away, he said, adding that ``prior to the explosion, we
had not been to this building.''
The blast was felt more than two miles away. Wood and other
debris were scattered where a two-story building once stood. Rubble
was strewn over four blocks. About 210 families were evacuated
after the explosion.
``Insulation was coming down like snow when we got here. One
apartment was engulfed in flames and the other building was in
flames,'' said State Trooper Anthony Blackburn.

BLASTS RIP DESERT SOLAR POWER PLANT 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BARSTOW 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A series of explosions and fire shut down electricity generation at the world's 
largest solar power plant near here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thick plumes of black smoke spiraled into the clear desert air when one of four 
natural gas-fired heaters used to back up the solar heating system exploded. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, a second natural gas heater caught fire and exploded as the 
first of 75 firefighters and 25 pieces of equipment were arriving at the site, 
about 140 miles northeast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a series of explosions, more than two," said Capt. Sharon Sellers of 
the San Bernardino County Fire Department. "Our first units got on-scene at 
9:16 a.m. and a second explosion occurred at that point, then a series of them 
during the entire incident," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a mushroom cloud. The heat was real intense and there were 
explosions," said an inmate from the Boron Federal Prison Camp who was pressed 
into service to help fight the fire. He would not identify himself. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said two workers at the plant suffered minor breathing problems and 
were treated at Barstow Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Operated by LUZ International Ltd. of Los Angeles, the $280-million Harper Lake 
solar plant began generating electricity on Dec. 28 and produces 80 megawatts, 
enough power to serve 115,000 people. The company operates eight such plants in 
the California desert. Combined, they generate 274 megawatts, which is sold to 
Southern California Edison Co. An Edison spokesman said there was no 
interruption of electric service to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two oil heaters on line and were bringing up the third and fourth oil 
heaters when this explosion occurred," LUZ International spokeswoman Kathleen 
Flanagan said in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
While no flames were visible 1 1/2 hours after the fire began shortly before 9 
a.m., San Bernardino County firefighters had difficulty reaching the blaze deep 
within the generating equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is fire up there somewhere still heating that oil," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was contained, but continued to burn late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the fire was unknown, but fire officials ruled out arson and said it 
probably resulted from an equipment malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
While Flanagan said she could not immediately estimate the cost of the blaze, 
the Fire Department said a single natural gas heater costs $500,000. One was 
destroyed and a second was heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said the black smoke from an estimated 15,000 gallons of burning 
synthetic oil was not any more toxic than smoke from natural crude or refined 
oil and was not carcinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
But that report was disputed by Capt. Clyde Gamma of the California Department 
of Forestry and Fire Protection. He identified the synthetic oil as Therminol 
and said it is cancer-causing. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said the plant could resume generating electricity by Monday. But she 
said the backup natural gas-fired heaters would not be used. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be operating strictly in the solar mode," she said. For solar 
generation, large curved mirrors are used to concentrate the sun's energy onto 
synthetic oil, which flows through an insulated steel pipe. The hot oil boils 
water into steam that drives conventional electrical turbines. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said LUZ International had a fire about two years ago at another solar 
plant at Daggett and that explosions continued five hours into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Stammer reported from Los Angeles and Harris from Barstow.
