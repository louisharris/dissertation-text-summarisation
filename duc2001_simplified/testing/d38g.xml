ORACLE, Ariz.: the bugs.
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even the scientists came to cross-purposes in designing this
little world. Botanists wanted wind for pollination. Entomologists
did not want their bugs sucked up by big fans. The people in the
middle were the engineers, constantly revising plans, compromising.
</P>
<P>
It is the professional nature of engineers and architects to
keep the outside world out. Now suddenly they had to devise ways to
keep the wild world in. As for the scientists, they were used to
having the whole outdoors as a laboratory. Now they have to be
satisfied with a very confined indoors.
</P>
<P>
Consider hummingbirds, great little pollinators. But a pair of
hummingbirds need the nectar of 3,200 flowers a day for energy.
</P>
<P>
Scientists had to be sure there would be that many in bloom every
day of the year.
</P>
<P>
At the outset, no one thought what would happen to the airtight
bubble with the air heating up and expanding during the day. It
would explode the glass. So the engineers devised external,
inflatable lungs that would store the excess until it cooled for
return to the biosphere.
</P>
<P>
With a closed water supply, engineers also had to devise
exterior tanks to cool the liquid. In short, this small world in
some cases is too small for its own good.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless it will be the same air and water year-round. The
oxygen is breathed in by humans and animals who breathe out carbon
dioxide which is breathed in by the plants and used in
photosynthesis which produces more oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Biosphere II is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural
proclivity of water. A stream begins on an 85-foot mountain that
dominates the rain forest. It then flows through the plains and
grasslands of the savanna, down to the 25-foot deep ocean with its
coral reef and then to the salt and freshwater marshes, drying up
before it reaches the desert.
</P>
<P>
The water-laden air then is drawn and climbs the mountain where
natural cooling and condensing coils bring it down as rain and dew
to feed the stream again.
</P>
<P>
The desert required a compromise. There was no way to reduce the
humidity. So Dr. Tony Burgess of the University of Arizona
patterned the deserts after those of Baja California where the
cactus and other plants have learned to live with ocean fog.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult design was Dr. Walter Addey's for the
salt and freshwater marshes. He built prototypes, one in the
basement of the Smithsonian Institution where he is director of the
Marine Systems Laboratory, and another in a greenhouse of
Washington's Old Soldiers Home. The problem was the proximity of
the fresh and saltwater species. The result is a miniature Florida
Everglades.
``The marsh may have been one of the most fragile of the systems
because of the life that lives in the mud,'' explains Kathy Dyhr.
``But in the prototypes he found they had virtually no species
extinctions except for the mosquitoes, to which everyone raised a
cheer. But Walter said that's not so great because we need them for
the fish. So they put up signs that said don't swat the
mosquitoes.''
In a world without chemicals, the biosphere settlers will rely
on ladybugs, lacewings, marigolds and crop rotation to control
pests. Human and animal waste and compost becomes fertilizer.
``The earth has its problems,'' says Carl Hodges of the
University of Arizona who designed the human habitat. ``We've got
acid rain problems, dirty air problems, and we've got carbon
dioxide increasing at an alarming rate. Right now we don't have a
research tool where we can control the global parameters, like CO2
and the quality of the atmosphere. I see the big payoff of
Biosphere II as learning how to do a better job of stewardship of
Biosphere I.''
The rain forest and its towering mountain and stream are the
design of Dr. Ghillean Prance, director of the Kew Royal Botanical
Gardens of London in association with the New York Botanical
Garden. He patterned it after the dwindling rain forests of the
Amazon.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Warshall of the University of Arizona patterned the
savanna grasslands after those of South America, Australia and
Africa. Plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands
in Biosphere II.
</P>
<P>
In all, some 3,800 species of plant and animal life are being
invited to the party, and as in the original Eden, snakes. Says
Dyhr, ``We may need a python in there, if we put in rodents which
help aerate the soil and carry seeds.'' There will be no large
predators, however. Not enough room. An ocelot needs two acres to
range for food. There might be some mouse deer to help eat the
grasses.
</P>
<P>
Of almost as much interest as the individual biomes are the
ecotones or tension areas where one biome yields reluctantly to the
next. In these areas, where well-defined habitats change,
scientists hope to learn how desert encroaches on more productive
areas, what happens when fresh water turns brackish, what goes on
when climates change.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a biosphere, a living creation of nature with its
own logic, its own rules, is not new. Probably the first to
consider Earth and its environment as a biosphere was a Soviet
scientist, V.I. Vernadsky, in 1926. The idea was further developed
by James Lovelock and Lynn Margolis, who postulated, after Darwin,
that the environment helps mediate species variation.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, or near it, they suggested that oxygen was
sparse and so most of the early creatures were anaerobic bacteria
that didn't need oxygen. But they gave off oxygen, and in the
process poisoned their own environment so they had to retreat into
the mud.
</P>
<P>
Biosphere II may teach mankind enough so it does not suffer the
same fate.

Botanist Readying For Biosphere Test Exit Calls Experiment Success
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Botanist Linda Leigh, who has spent the
last three weeks literally in her element, called her stay in an
experimental biosphere a success Wednesday but said she's ready to
return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
When Ms. Leigh exits Thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days inside
an airtight, 17,000-cubic foot glass-and-steel structure, she will
have been the longest inhabitant of a completely enclosed
ecosystem, with air and water generated and recycled independently
of Earth's.
``I'll be emerging tomorrow at 2 p.m. as scheduled, and
everything is rolling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Leigh has been living inside a test module for Biosphere II,
a $30 million project under construction. Scientists plan to place
four men and four women inside a much larger sealed structure for
two years to determine whether humans can duplicate Earth's life
systems for possible use in space.
``The one thing that I really do miss is just companionship,''
Ms. Leigh said Wednesday in a telephone interview from within the
module, located on a ranch about 30 miles north of Tucson.
``I don't think that it's a matter of feeling lonely, but
there's just something about direct human contact and sitting with
somebody and pouring them a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and
having that morning discussion; it's very different than doing it
over the phone or over the video,'' she said.
``Other than that, I'm quite content on the inside. I feel like
I could stay in here indefinitely.''
Since entering the module Nov. 2, Ms. Leigh has been in frequent
daily contact with her outside support team by telephone, video
conference, two-way radio and just looking through the glass
windows.
</P>
<P>
Three daily medical checks, including pulse at rest and after
exercise, blood pressure, pulmonary function, blood oxygen
saturation and urine tests, have shown her health is ``unbelievably
positive. The physicians on the outside can't believe it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
Two people also check her psychologically each day, Ms. Leigh
said, ``just to make sure that my state of mind or humor is
normal.''
Ms. Leigh baked herself a 39th birthday cake on Nov. 12 of
sorghum, rice flour and sweet potatoes harvested from her
mini-field. Her colleagues serenaded her with ``Happy Birthday'' by
video and directed her to gifts hidden in her living area.
</P>
<P>
Other crops have ranged from jalapeno peppers to kohlrabi. Lemon
grass, mint, tarragon and fennel are among the herbs she has used
to season her meals and make tea. She also has a tank of talapia
fish.
``I had talapia Vera Cruzana the other night,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Water for drinking, cooking and showering is dehumidified from
the air. Samples are passed through a special port for outside
analysis, along with samples of waste water and her urine. The rest
of the waste water is fed into a marsh recycling system.
</P>
<P>
The botanist also has had to be a mechanic and technician,
repairing the loose belt of a large fan that heats and cools the
module, and fine-tuning the irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Leigh said she hasn't felt isolated because her support team
is excellent. In fact, she occasionally has had to pull the
curtains in her living area to get away from the observing eyes
outside. Either that, ``or I go out into what we call `the
wilderness' and just stay out within the plants.''

How Will Eight People Fare in Enclosed World?

<P>
So, you say, what will happen when they
lock four men and four women inside this fancy fish bowl for two
years and watch 'em grow alfalfa sprouts and rice?
</P>
<P>
How, indeed, are eight ``biospherians'' going to fare testing
the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting
environments, called biomes, as well as an intensive agricultural
complex, to duplicate the Earth's ecology?
</P>
<P>
How are they going to react in shepherding 3,800 species of
plants and animals that will provide food and air while all wastes
are recycled within Biosphere II?
</P>
<P>
And in getting along with each other?
</P>
<P>
Exceedingly well, according to predictions.
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely, all agree, that any of the eight crew members to
be selected later this year from among 14 candidates in this $30
million private experiment, will go bonkers. Withdrawal or
confrontation under stress are unlikely, all say.
``They're so highly motivated in the first place, I would not be
surprised to see the whole thing go through without a hitch,
personnel-wise,'' said Robert B. Bechtel, an environmental
psychologist at the University of Arizona.
``My guess would be that they would probably have somewhat fewer
problems than you would normally encounter in the classical
isolation experience,'' said Mary Connors, a psychologist and
division staff member at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames Research Center near Sunnyvale, Calif., who
until recently was acting chief of its Crew Research and Space
Human Factors Branch. ``They just have more options.''
The biospherians will be physically separated from the outside
world, or Biosphere I, but they will not be isolated, said John
Rummel, a life sciences physician at NASA. Nor are they likely to
suffer sensory deprivation or claustrophobia in the main compound,
which measures 2\ acres.
</P>
<P>
They'll have the latest gadgets, from video teleconferencing and
worldwide phone contact to television, VCRs and computers in their
plush apartment complex and office-laboratory area.
</P>
<P>
And they will have unusual options if they want to get away from
each other. The biospherians will be able to stargaze from their
own rain forest or ocean beach.
</P>
<P>
Experiments in long-term situations where small groups of people
live in harsh climatic or environmental extremes, such as the in
Antarctica or underwater, usually are viewed in terms of
``isolation, confinement, deprivation and risk,'' Connors said.
</P>
<P>
But crew members will be allowed to leave through air locks if
health or extreme family emergencies necessitate, eliminating the
sense of risk, she said.
</P>
<P>
Roy Walford, a pathologist, nutrition specialist and the only
physician seeking one of the eight slots, says he thinks the
biggest problem may be overwork.
</P>
<P>
A community and rural health family practitioner associated with
the University of Arizona who has developed a close relationship
with the candidates will be among those watching from the outside.
</P>
<P>
Walford and Biosphere spokeswoman Kathleen Dyhr, also hoping to
make the crew, said each candidate has worked on the project for at
least three years.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Dyhr said the selection process uses no psychological
testing. Rather, such factors as ability to work together,
problem-solving skills, willingness to accept other views and
professionalism are keys, and ``by selecting for some of those
factors you can relieve a lot of interpersonal tensions.''
Connors and Bechtel said the strong job focus, cross-work
training and the fact that the potential crew members have worked
and spent significant time together all are highly advantageous.
</P>
<P>
Creativity, spontaneity, withdrawal, unexpected irritability,
eating patterns and general health will be watched, but the best
sensors likely will be the crew members themselves.
</P>
<P>
Most say the crew will develop its own ``equilibrium'' once
closed life gets under way.
</P>
<P>
But will that lead to romantic relationships, to interludes
under the waterfall or in the huge basements beneath the complex?
</P>
<P>
Will the crew be celibate?
</P>
<P>
Views range from ``who cares'' to unlikely to probable.
``Mine has always been that it's unlikely, because I think
people tend to act as crews when they get in an experience that is
prolonged,'' Connors said.
``I would suspect that they would get into a familial
relationship rather than a couples relationship ... more like
siblings act,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Bechtel said: ``How could you avoid it? But on the other hand,
they're in a fish bowl.''
``Let's just put it this way,'' Ms. Dyhr said, ``there's nothing
really that a corporation can do about what their employees do
after 5 o'clock. We live in a free country and for the most part
people do whatever they want to do.''
But what if two people fall in love? Is marriage by
teleconferencing possible?
``Given the fact that various members of the clergy have shown
themselves to be innovative and agreeable to doing marriages under
very unusual circumstances, I'm sure that they could find a way to
do it,'' Ms. Dyhr said.
</P>
<P>
On the other extreme, the psychologists say literature on
confinement and isolation studies shows few examples of violence.
</P>
<P>
The Biosphere's purpose is ``not to test interpersonal
relations,'' but to test ``whether they can reproduce the Earth's
atmosphere by a mixture of plants, animals and bacteria,'' Bechtel
said.
</P>
<P>
Bechtel thinks the biggest problem will be whether seals around
the glass panels covering the gigantic geodesic dome stay under
wide ranges of heat and cold.
</P>
<P>
He and Connors also said most studies of crews, including
mixed-sex groups in environments far harsher and smaller than the
biospherians are likely to encounter, have shown them to be highly
motivated, energetic and willing to put up with almost anything for
the sake of the project and the team's success.
</P>
<P>
Bechtel said the public has a misconception that putting eight
people together will mean ``all kinds of interesting things can
happen.''
Rather, he said, ``They're really caretakers. They're really out
there to tend the plants and animals. It's a kind of farming
adventure.''

A 66-year-old physician, a botanist and a
marine biologist were among four men and four women picked today to
spend two years inside a 2\-acre sealed dome intended to be a
microcosm of Earth.
</P>
<P>
The eight from the United States, West Germany, England and
Belgium will be the crew of the giant terrarium known as Biosphere
II. The privately financed $30 million project aims for a December
start.
</P>
<P>
Biosphere II will resemble a space colony tethered to Earth. It
will be a laboratory for solving environmental problems on
Biosphere I _ the Earth _ as well as a prototype for sustaining
life outside this world.
</P>
<P>
The crew, all single, consists of:
_ Dr. Roy Walford, 66, the oldest crew member and only
physician, a research gerontologist, nutritionist and professor of
pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine, and the project's medical
chief and biomedical consultant.
_ Linda Leigh, 38, a botanist who directed and coordinated the
project's ecosystem planning for land areas, or biomes, directed
the collection and acquisition of more than 2,000 plant species and
spent three weeks last fall inside a completely closed test module.
_ Bernd Zabel, 41, an electrical engineer from Munich, West
Germany, who served as construction general manager for the project.
_ Sally Silverstone, 35, a native of Walthamstow, England, who
has administered the Space Biospheres Ventures' architectural
division.
_ Abigail K. Alling, 31, a marine biologist from Maine with
degrees from Middlebury College and Yale University who has
directed the Biosphere's marine ecological systems.
_ Taber Kyle MacCallum, 26, of Albuquerque, N.M., in charge of
the Biosphere's analytical laboratory.
_ Jane Elizabeth Poynter, 28, a native of Surrey, England, who
has been manager of the intensive agriculture system.
_ Mark Van Thillo, of Wilrijk-Antwerp, Belgium, who has been in
charge of construction quality control.
</P>
<P>
Two others who had been finalists included Norberto
Alvarez-Romo, 37, of Guadalajara, Mexico, and Silke Schneider, 31,
a West German.
</P>
<P>
For two years, the crew's world inside the geodesic frame of
glass and steel will consist of seven ecological regions: rain
forest, savannah, ocean, fresh and saltwater marshes, desert,
agriculture and human habitat. The latter includes apartments and
laboratory, office and recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
Sprinkled into the ecological stew will be 3,800 plant and
animal species. All air, water and food will be generated
independently of the Earth's atmosphere and will be recycled, as
will all wastes.
</P>
<P>
The only link between the dome's ecological system and Earth
will be electrical power transmissions, as well as computers and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The experiment, a stepchild of Texas financier Edward P. Bass,
could become a money-producing venture, particularly as a means of
showing ways of responding to environmental problems such as
pollution, scientists have said.

  THE LAUNCHING OF BIOSPHERE 2
SKEPTICS SNICKER, BUT THE EXPERIMENT BEGINS
THURSDAY  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an idea that grew out of a New Mexico commune: Build a mini-Earth in a
glass bubble, learn to live in it, then ship it into space as Mars' first
Motel 6.;   Fast forward 20 years, throw in $150 million of oil money, a few
respectable researchers and voila:  
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Biosphere 2 - a domed Garden of Eden in the foothills of the
Santa Catalina mountains outside Tucson. Here, beginning on Thursday, four men
and four women will confine themselves for two years in one of the most
bizarre research escapades in modern times.;   Is it science or schlock? A
tour de force or a tourist trap?;   A year behind schedule and five years in
the making, Biosphere 2 has forged ahead despite questions about its
credibility, charges of cultism and accusations that leaders bullied departed
consultants.;   The creation of billionaire oil mogul Edward Bass, Biosphere 2
aims to study how people can live in an airtight world. In this biological
maze, plants will recycle human wastes and turn them into the sustenance of
life - air, food and water.;   Biosphere 2 could be the first step in the
construction of a massive way station in space, its developers hope, and at
the very least could help improve life on Earth.;   But as the "Biospherians"
prepare to don their spiffy blue jump suits and kiss the outside world
goodbye, Earthlings are watching with a mixture of awe, fascination and
skepticism.;   Supporters gush that the grand experiment rivals the moon
landing. Detractors snicker that Biosphere 2 could be the greatest stunt since
"War of the Worlds.";   "I don't know what they are attempting to do," said
Robert D. MacElroy, a scientist at NASA/Ames Research Center at Moffett Field,
where plans for a small space cottage are in their infancy.;   MacElroy has
visited the Biosphere 2 project and said, "There's a pretty grotesque size
differential to what we're involved in. I don't know . . . how it would help
with what we're doing.";   'NASA could never do this'; "NASA could never do
this," countered Robert Frye, a project consultant and ecologist at the
University of Arizona's Environmental Research Laboratory. "NASA would have
spent a hundred million dollars and come up with a roomful of reports. But
Biosphere 2 has a structure that can be used and studied for 100 years.";  
Looking like Hollywood's "Battlestar Gallactica," the gleaming steel-and-glass
shell of Biosphere 2 is as long as three football fields and as tall as a
five-story building. Inside are parts of a South American rain forest, a
Caribbean coral reef and ocean, a Florida freshwater swamp, a Baja desert and
a tropical Australian savannah. They are inhabited by 3,800 transplanted
species of birds, reptiles, plants and insects.;   The eight Biospherians, all
single, will electronically monitor their world through a maze of computers in
the glitzy command center. A short walk will take them from the shore of an
ocean to the mountains of a rain forest to barren desert. They will live in
modern loft apartments and be under the constant watch of Biosphere 1 - the
Earth - from a "Mission Control" located across the street.;   The mood
inside Biosphere 2 was upbeat last week as participants counted down the days
until Thursday's "closure," when air locks will be shut and the crew sealed
inside. They seemed unperturbed by continuing questions from reporters about
the project's credibility.;   News reports since 1985 have linked the
project's leaders to a 1970s commune where, some ex-commune members say,
Biosphere 2 executive John Allen led a cult devoted to creating a new
civilization. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that one of Allen's
protege's was oilman Bass, Biosphere 2's main financier.;   Leader was a
'tyrant';   Laurence Veysey, a retired history professor from the University
of California, Santa Cruz, who studied the commune in 1971, remembers Allen as
a tyrant given to rages. Veysey recalls seeing "biosphere" written on a
dining-room wall of the New Mexico commune, Synergia Ranch.;   "They were a
very secretive group," said Veysey, who devoted 100 pages to the ranch in a
book on communes. "It was hard to figure out what they were up to.";   In the
years since the commune disbanded, Allen's vision and Bass's deep pockets have
funded ecological ventures from Katmandu to France to western Australia. One
was the Institute of Ecotechnics in London, billed by Biosphere 2 as "a
major-ecological think-tank." Several of Biosphere 2's leaders have
unaccredited degrees from the institute.;   Institute non-existent;   A
Canadian television documentary last year went looking for the institute and
found only an office over a cafe and art gallery.;   Allen and Bass could not
be reached for comment. In the past, Bass has denied being influenced by
Allen, who told the Arizona Daily Star in June that he never operated "any
mystical program.";   "The whole cult thing is ridiculous," said Kathleen
Dyhr, spokeswoman for Biosphere 2. "There have been so many people with
Biosphere 2 who never had anything to do with John Allen 20 years ago.";  
During construction, Biosphere 2 recruited outside consultants from such
reputable institutions as Yale University and the Smithsonian, Dyhr said. And
many of the ecological studies here have been lauded by the scientific
community, she said.;   Project has defectors;   But at least a half-dozen
respected researchers have left the project, citing differences of substance
and style. Some later recanted their criticisms, saying they were warned by
Biosphere representatives they could be sued for libel.;   Even now, many
mainstream scientists wonder what Biosphere 2 will accomplish.;   Its makers
contend they have made an ecological system "out of nothing." But the
structure will be powered by a set of natural gas generators and maintained by
a staff of 50 outside support people.;   Some scientists also wonder whether
Biosphere 2 will be leakproof. How will it hold up under the elements? And if
they survive two years, what will Biospherians learn, other than how to live
in a gigantic terrarium?;   Naivety suggested; "I think they went into this
rather naively," said Frank Salisbury, a plant physiologist at Utah State
University. "I hope something good comes out of this, but I'm skeptical.";  
Biosphere 2 officials counter that something good already has, and point to 50
design patents in the works.;   First and foremost, they say, Biosphere 2 is a
business. It's already the state's second largest tourist attraction after the
Grand Canyon, and promoters are banking that more than a million people a year
will visit.;   In fact, in the first five months of 1991, 65,000 people came
to see the project, a hundredfold increase over the same period in 1990.;  
Shown a movie and taken on a walking tour for $9.95, visitors mostly gush over
the landscape and rarely ask probing questions. They crowd the gift shop
buying up Biosphere 2 memorabilia.;   "It's really turning out to be nothing
more than a tourist attraction," said Yvonne Clearwater, an environmental
psychologist at NASA/Ames who sees little scientific value to Biosphere 2.;  
"It's kind of like a kooky Disneyland."

  EIGHT 'BIOSPHERIANS' SAY GOODBYE UNTIL 1993  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dressed like space travelers from "Star Trek," eight smiling "biospherians"
were locked this morning into a sealed terrarium where they plan to stay until
1993 while trying to replicate the Earth's environment.;   The ceremonial
"closure" was not without the histrionics that have marked the bizarre
Biosphere 2 project - described alternatively as a modern-day Noah's Ark and
a scientific sham.  
</P>
<P>
Billionaire oil executive Edward Bass, who bankrolled much of the $150
million project, invoked the visions of Galileo, Leonardo da Vinci and the
Wright brothers. One crew member gushed about a future when humans will become
"custodians of our world.";   "Today we gather at a new instrument . . . to
explore the mysteries of our very own home planet," Bass said, as the crew
members, wearing futuristic black uniforms, fought to contain their emotions.;
Crew member Abigail Alling, 31, her voice quavering, evoked the sometimes
mystical bent of Biosphere 2's organizers: "By necessity, we biospherians walk
in as custodians of our world and bring past and future together.";   At 8:18
a.m., the four men and four women of the crew exchanged quick hugs and kisses
with relatives and project officials, stepped through an air-lock door, waved
through the round window, and disappeared inside the 3.15-acre geodesic-framed
compound.;   "I have had a vision that man could change from being a
desert-maker into a builder of oases," crew member Mark Nelson said before
stepping through the air lock.;   Biosphere 2 consists of several climatic
zones - rain forest, savanna, ocean and marsh - packed with 3,800 plant and
animal species. It's all part of a test of space-colonization technology with
the dream of someday locating such a complex on Mars.;   The ultra-modern
complex includes such luxury items as computers, facsimile machines,
telephones, televisions, videocassette recorders and exercise equipment. The
communications apparatus will tie the crew into a control center located a few
hundred yards away, and to the rest of the world.;   Critics say the project
has little scientific merit. It has forged ahead despite doubts over its
authenticity, charges of cultism and the loss of several of its prominent
consultants.;   "The guise of science has fallen over time," said Yvonne
Clearwater, an environmental psychologist at the NASA Ames Research Center at
Moffett Field. "It's really turning out to be a tourist attraction.";   Space
Biospheres Ventures, developer of the private, for-profit project, expects to
draw up to a million visitors annually and has applied for some 50 design
patents.;   "Fundamentally, we are a business," Bass said. "Our first name
'Space' draws upon the most dramatic applications for the technologies we are
developing.";   The crew members, ranging in age from 27 to 67, will raise
their own food and recycle all air, water and wastes. Wednesday they
celebrated a final day of freedom with diversity by attending an ecological
seminar, a laser show, a cocktail party and a press conference.;   The
45-minute closing ceremony after dawn today included prayers from a Tibetan
monk and a sun dance by Dan Old Elk, a Sioux from Montana who presented each
crew member with a braided sprig of sweet grass from Canada.;   Alling, a
native of New York, said before the experiment began that she expects life
inside Biosphere 2 to be "much like a ship setting sail for the open sea.";  
"You're out there, and whatever you have on board and whoever is with you on
board is who you've got, and you've got to make it through whatever comes up,"
she said.;   The four-man, four-woman group has two people from England, one
from Belgium and five from the United States.;   Each crew member is likely to
spend about four hours daily on farming and other chores to maintain the
complicated machinery driving the Biosphere. Another four hours a day will go
to scientific work.;   Sex has not been ruled out among the crew members, but
none of the four women plans a pregnancy.;   Mark van Thillo, 30, of Belgium
said he would miss his country's chocolates, while Taber McCallum, 27, of
Albuquerque, N.M., said he'll regret not "sailing on the open ocean and the
open sky.";   The crew is hoping to stay inside for two years, barring serious
illness or other calamity.;   But Margret Augustine, president and chief
executive officer of the project, said problems could crop up after a month or
so that would require the crew to leave temporarily before returning for a
solid two years. And a person could leave if he or she suffered from extreme
psychological pressure, she said.;   'It's not a prison," she said.

After years of preparation, four men and four women Thursday shut the door on
the world they hope to aid and began two years of ecological research in
Biosphere 2, an airtight, three-acre structure of glass and steel that has
stirred controversy as well as awe.;   "Biospherians, good friends, bon
voyage!" exclaimed Ed Bass, the Fort Worth millionaire who bankrolled much of
the ambitious $150 million project that some see as a New Age sequel to Noah's
ark. "And fly your spaceship well that all of humankind might fly its
spaceship Earth better in the future."

Roy Walford followed the six others into the sprawling terrarium.;   After two
tries, the main passage to the outside slammed shut Thursday morning.;   At
midmorning, after a half-hour getting accustomed to their new situation, the
eight told project officials that each was about to begin work in his or her
respective "biome," or ecosystem. The Biosphere has a growing area as well as
wilderness rain forest, marsh, mini-ocean, African savanna and desert.;   What
the Biosphere residents find out over the next 24 months, proponents say, will
help to understand the workings of nature and the possibilities of living in
artificial atmospheres in outer space.;   They will recycle their air, water
and waste, and live off a half-acre of land and from plants grown in tanks of
water infused with nutrients. If french fries are on the menu, peanuts would
have to be uprooted and pressed for cooking oil and spuds harvested and
peeled.;   The eight researchers are all single, and there is no prohibition
against sex. This has led to more than a little speculation in nearby Oracle,
a 111-year-old community of 6,000, many of them copper miners and retirees.;  
"I told Laser (the nickname for Biospherian Mark Van Thillo), 'You're in there
two years and I'll bet you $5 you'll come out with two kids,' " said Larry
Springfield, 45, a locksmith on the project and manager of Maria's, an Oracle
saloon. "He said, 'Four.' "

Critics have long contended that the Biosphere 2 project in the Arizona desert
has more to do with showmanship or cultism than science, despite its repeated
assertions to the contrary.;   Now, a newspaper says the $150 million effort
is not the environmental experiment it claims to be.

The project began with much fanfare in September when four men and four
women, accompanied by 3,000 species of plants and animals, sealed themselves
inside a eight-story glass structure for a two-year experiment in biological
recycling.;   The allegations of misrepresentation involve a device that
removes carbon dioxide from the air and turns it into a solid for storage
inside the Biosphere.;   Carbon dioxide is exhaled by humans and metabolized
by plants.;   The current issue of the Village Voice says the group secretly
installed the device, violating the advertised goal of recycling all materials
naturally.;   The Voice also said the levels of carbon dioxide in Biosphere 2
were becoming dangerously high, apparently because of the decrease in sunlight
and the resulting decline in photosynthetic activity by the plants.;  
Kathleen Dyhr, a Biosphere spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview that the
group had indeed installed a carbon dioxide remover.;   She conceded that it
was not "natural" but called it a minor aid to help stabilize the atmosphere
during its initial fluctuations. The carbon dioxide levels were currently
fine, she added, though higher than outside the closed environment.;   Dyhr
said the privately financed project had no obligation to disclose all the
details of work in progress.;   "If the experiment were formally reported,
written up in a publication, and no mention was made of that fact, then that
would be fraud," she said. "But I don't know of any research project that
would discuss all its methods and techniques" this early in the process. "No
experiment would be giving out data to the press.";   From the start, when
planning for the Biosphere got under way in the mid-1980s, it was billed as a
futuristic experiment in closed recycling where plants and animals would
provide each other with all the essentials for life.;   Most especially, green
plants would take human wastes (urine, feces and carbon dioxide) and turn them
into oxygen, water and food for human consumption. No mention was made of
chemical aids to the process.
