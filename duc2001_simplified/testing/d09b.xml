<P>
Iraq's Saddam Hussein, facing U.S. and Arab troops at the Saudi
border, today sought peace on another front by promising to
withdraw from Iranian territory and release soldiers captured
during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Also today, King Hussein of Jordan arrived in Washington seeking
to mediate the Persian Gulf crisis. President Bush on Tuesday said
the United States may extend its naval quarantine to Jordan's Red
Sea port of Aqaba to shut off Iraq's last unhindered trade route.
</P>
<P>
In another mediation effort, the Soviet Union said today it had
sent an envoy to the Middle East on a series of stops to include
Baghdad. Soviet officials also said Soviet women, children and
invalids would be allowed to leave Iraq.
</P>
<P>
President Bush today denounced Saddam's ``ruinous policies of
war,'' and said the United States is ``striking a blow for the
principle that might does not make right.''
In a speech delivered at the Pentagon, Bush seemed to suggest
that American forces could be in the gulf region for some time.
``No one should doubt our staying power or determination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia continued at fever
pace, with Syrian troops now part of a multinational force camped
out in the desert to guard the Saudi kingdom from any new thrust by
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, read by a
broadcaster over Baghdad radio, Saddam said he will begin
withdrawing troops from Iranian territory on Friday and release
Iranian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Iran said an Iraqi diplomatic delegation was en route to Tehran
to deliver Saddam's message, which it said it would review ``with
optimism.''
Saddam appeared to accept a border demarcation treaty he had
rejected in peace talks following the August 1988 cease-fire of the
eight-year war with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The move seemed aimed at heading off more trouble with Iran,
which had condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 but also
criticized the multinational force dispatched to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said he sought to ``turn the gulf into a lake of peace
free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor ill intentions
against us.''
In other developments:
_The Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is
considering urging Bush to order a national callup of armed forces
reserves for active duty because of the drain on units sending
soldiers abroad. Bush can call up to 200,000 reservists for up to
180 days without seeking congressional approval.
_Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said special
ambassador Mikhail Sytenko left Tuesday for consultations with the
governments of Syria, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Sytenko, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations,
is also expected to visit Baghdad, Gremitskikh said at a regular
news briefing today.
_The outlook darkened for about 3,000 Americans caught in Iraq
and Kuwait when Saddam sent his forces into the small, oil-rich
sultanate.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ambassador to Greece said in Athens the Americans and
other stranded foreigners could leave ``as soon as the threats from
the United States and its allies are eliminated.'' ABC quoted an
Iraqi Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad as saying Americans in
Iraq are ``restrictees'' who will stay there until the crisis ends.
_The Soviet Foreign Ministry said Soviet women, children and
invalids would be permitted to leave Iraq. Spokesman Yuri
Gremitskikh said the first group of 230 evacuees was assembling in
Baghdad today, but evacuation plans were hampered by desert heat
and lack of transportation.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 9,000 Soviets were among the hundreds of thousands of
foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq has agreed to allow all
880 Soviets in Kuwait to leave, but only by a 1,200-mile road route
through Iraq and to the Iraq-Jordan border.
_The British Foreign Office said today conditions in Kuwait
appear to be deteriorating. There have been reports of wholesale
looting but food and gasoline were still available, said a
spokesman, who by custom was not identified. Banks remained closed.
_The Iraqi ambassador to Venezuela said on Tuesday that Iraq
would retaliate against Venezuela and other OPEC oil cartel members
if they boost oil production to fill the gap created by blocked
supplies from Iraq and Kuwait. With Kuwait now ``annexed,'' Iraq
has control of 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. A steep rise
in world oil prices followed the Kuwait invasion.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Aug. 6 ordered a global embargo on
trade with Iraq as punishment for seizing Kuwait. Bush then sent
U.S. troops and planes to Saudi Arabia, saying Iraqi troops massed
nearby in Kuwait threatened Saudi Arabia and its vast oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Arab League nations voted for an Arab force to protect
Saudi Arabia, with the vanguard of Syria's contingent arriving
Tuesday, according to diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi
capital.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and Moroccan troops are already there.
</P>
<P>
The predominantly Moslem nation of Bangladesh said today its
troops would join multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. The size of
the contingent was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Saudi Arabia in effect shut down Iraq's major oil
outlets through those countries, but according to Jordanian
officials, a smaller line into Jordan remained operating.
</P>
<P>
Truckloads of goods rolled into Iraq from Jordan on Tuesday and
Iraqi-bound cargo was unloaded from ships at the Red Sea port
ofAqaba despite the U.N.-ordered sanctions.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein was reportedly carrying a message to Bush from
Iraq's Saddam, with whom the king met Monday. The monarch will meet
Bush on Thursday in Kennebunkport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother and political
adviser, was asked today about the message the king was said to be
carrying. In an interview from Jordan on ABC, he declined to
discuss details, but said: ``I don't think that his majesty would
be traveling at this crucial moment if the Iraqi leadership did not
have a rational approach to the future.''
</P>
<P>
A CBS News report citing unidentified Jordanian sources said
that Saddam's message called for an international conference to be
convened to discuss an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. In exchange,
the buildup of U.S. forces in the region would halt. Bush, however,
says he sees no short-term hope for a diplomatic solution to the
gulf crisis _ at least until economic sanctions force Saddam to
withdraw his army.
</P>
<P>
Bush held out the prospect of more aid to Jordan if it
cooperates with the trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the United States and Soviet Union conferred in
Washington on putting an anti-Iraq naval blockade under a United
Nations umbrella.
</P>
<P>
The United States has provided most of the naval vessels so far
to block Iraqi trade, with Britain, West Germany and Australia
among the other nations lending support at sea.
</P>
<P>
The embargo is meant to cripple Iraq by cutting off its exports
of oil and imports of food and military supplies. Iraq imports
about three-quarters of its foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. allies and other U.N. members have objected that the
Security Council embargo resolution did not specifically authorize
such a naval operation.
</P>
<P>
Bush told a news conference on Tuesday that the naval barricade
now in force might be extended to Jordan's Aqaba ``if it is a hole
through which commerce flows'' in and out of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, today is the eighth day of ``Desert Shield,''
the operation designed to confront an estimated 200,000 Iraqi
soldiers now in Kuwait. Iraq boasts an army of 1 million members.
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to be committed to Desert
Shield within weeks, including Marines, Army air assault forces,
paratroopers and infantry.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it invaded Kuwait because of disputes over oil and
money. It accused Kuwait of deliberately slashing Iraqi oil
revenues by overproducing oil and driving down prices, among other
charges.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has 17 million residents, and Kuwait about 1.9 million.

Gulf Showdown Takes More Personal Tack: Saddam Calls Bush a `Liar'

<P>
The Persian Gulf showdown between Iraq and the United States
took a more personal turn Thursday when Iraq's Saddam Hussein
called President Bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war
could bring thousands of Americans home in coffins.
</P>
<P>
Bush, commenting on the two-week-old gulf crisis from his
vacation home in Maine, said he saw little reason to be optimistic
about a settlement of the dispute, which stems from Iraq's invasion
of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the
border of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour meeting at his Kennebunkport home with King
Hussein of Jordan, Bush said, ``I did not come away with any
feeling of hope'' that Iraq would withdraw its army from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bush also said Thursday that King Hussein assured him Jordan
would close the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade as the
economic embargo on materials to Iraq continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
Foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked from entry; Iraq
imports about three-quarters of its food.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile said the Bush
administration plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the region to back
up the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force troops already in
place in the gulf and the Saudi desert.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Jordan ``is seeking some guidance'' about a provision in the
U.N.-backed trade embargo that allows food for humanitarian
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Worries however grew about the safety of Americans and other
Westerners trapped in Kuwait. Iraqi military authorities ordered
all Americans and Britons in Kuwait to assemble at a hotel,
officials said.
``Very few'' of the 2,500 Americans in occupied Kuwait complied
with the order, a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the roundup was to protect them from unspecified
threats; British Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave called
the order ``grave and sinister.''
``What we fear is that they will be interned somewhere, most
likely in Iraq,'' Waldegrave said.
</P>
<P>
A total of about 3,000 Americans, 3,000 Britons and more than
450 Japanese are in Iraq and Kuwait. Overall, more than 2 million
foreigners are in both countries. Iraq has called them
``restrictees.''
In addition to the estimated 45,000 Marines to ultimately be
part of Operation Desert Shield, Stealth fighter planes and the
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are also headed to Saudi Arabia to
protect it from Iraqi expansionism.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Iraq has
continued to increase its armed forces in Kuwait and they now
number about 160,000.
</P>
<P>
Saddam has been under international quarantine since his Aug. 2
power-grab, or what he calls an ``eternal merger'' with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In a long verbal attack read on Iraqi television Thursday,
Saddam repeatedly called Bush ``a liar'' and said a shooting war
could produce body bags courtesy of Baghdad.
``We continue to pray and pray hard to God so that there will be
no confrontation whereby you will receive thousands of Americans
wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed them into a dark
tunnel,'' Saddam said.
</P>
<P>
He called U.S. soldiers massing in Saudi Arabia the real
occupiers in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Replied State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher, ``We
haven't really analyzed the statement in detail but it appears to
be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his attempts
to distort the truth.
``We believe that his words cannot distract the world from the
facts of Iraqi aggression.''
An international land, sea and air force has mobilized since
Iraq's invasion, which was sparked by disputes over oil, land and
repayment of war loans.
</P>
<P>
In the largest U.S. military operation since Vietnam, an
estimated 20,000 American GIs have already massed to defend Saudi
Arabia.
``We don't just arrive,'' said four-star Gen. John Dailey,
assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. ``We're there to
stay for a fairly lengthy period.''
Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh also committed ground
troops, to a much lesser degree.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy has 27 ships in the maritime barricade of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They are aided by Britain, West Germany, Australia, Canada, the
Netherlands and Belgium. Bush was expected to authorize naval
commanders to use ``the minimum force necessary'' to interdict
shipments to and from Iraq, a U.S. official said. That could
include firing across the bow to halt a ship.
</P>
<P>
In the air, U.S. Air Force fliers say they have engaged in ``a
little cat and mouse'' with Iraqi warplanes, which have retreated
when weapons radar locks onto them. ``They don't want to play with
us,'' one U.S. crew chief said.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, the Iraqis have rimmed the capital city with an
air-defense system, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. He declined to say if the weapons included
missiles, but the Iraqis have them in their arsenal. The Iraqis
also possess chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The combined operations are designed to isolate and strangle
Iraq until it retreats from Kuwait. The quarantine hopes to staunch
the flow of Iraqi oil, which is Iraq's economic lifeblood, and
clamp down on food and supplies going in.
</P>
<P>
Iraq now controls 20 percent of the world's oil reserves with
its conquest of Kuwait. Only Saudi Arabia has more oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
The economic chokehold appears to be working.
</P>
<P>
The Lloyd's List International newspaper, which monitors
worldwide shipping, said Iraq's fleet of 80 tankers and cargo ships
has stopped regular trading.
</P>
<P>
John Prescott, a shipping correspondent, said there was no
shipping in Kuwaiti or Iraqi ports and that activity was trailing
off in the Jordanian port of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
Bush's chief objective in his meeting with Hussein was to press
the king to shut down Iraq's food and oil supply route from Aqaba
on the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Aqaba is Iraq's only outlet now that an international noose has
tightened. Bush has indicated the U.S. Navy will barricade the port
from Iraqi ships. The president also has offered to help offset
Jordan's costs because 40 percent of its exports go to Iraq and 90
percent of its oil comes from there.
``It's our only outlet to the sea and the rest of the world,''
Hussein said. He also said of trade with Iraq: ``There are no
shipments at the moment.''
A day earlier, scores of trucks, many with Iraqi license plates,
streamed north out of Aqaba to Amman and onto the desert highway
bound for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch met this week with Saddam, but he told
reporters he had no message from Baghdad. ``I am not talking on
behalf of anyone in the area ... but myself,'' Hussein said.
</P>
<P>
In the United Nations, Libya called for the replacement of U.S.
forces in the Persian Gulf with Arab League forces and U.N.
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in a letter to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General, also called for an emergency Security Council
meeting in Geneva to remove U.S. forces. There was no decision on a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two of the 159 U.N. members had filed compliance reports
by Wednesday, and all were honoring the sanctions Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, Saudi Arabia called for an emergency conference
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss how
much oil to pump.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied the kingdom had notified any of its
customers of any cutbacks in oil supply. Reports attributed to the
Japanese foreign ministry said Saudi Arabia told U.S., European and
Japanese oil companies of a 15-20 percent cutback in its oil supply
in September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said
Thursday that Saddam was the target of an assassination attempt,
which led to ``large-scale'' arrests, including some close
associates of the Iraqi strongman.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted witnesses as saying tanks and armored cars are
patrolling the streets of Baghdad. There was no independent
confirmation of the report by the government-run news agency, which
did not say when the reported attempt occurred.

<TEXT>
<P>
Late July: George Steinbrenner is still
running the Yankees, the governor of Louisiana is deciding whether
to veto an abortion bill and the first tropical disturbance of
summer, a storm named Arthur, makes its appearance in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The American press seems bent on finding out who David Souter is
and what his thoughts are about abortion. President Bush has just
nominated him to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Few Americans much notice that Saddam Hussein of Iraq is
accusing his small neighbors of harboring an ``imperial-Zionist
plan'' to drive down the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
Don't blame yourself if you missed the rumblings that were to
suddenly put the United States on war footing and land a vast
military force on the searing Saudi desert, where American troops
had never before been welcomed.
</P>
<P>
What led to that, the quarrel between Iraq and its little
neighbor, Kuwait, just seemed like another of those wrangles over
oil production and pricing that occur before the meetings of OPEC
sheiks and statesmen.
</P>
<P>
Oil? Wasn't there a glut?
</P>
<P>
War? Wasn't this the era of the peace dividend?
</P>
<P>
The oil glut was the problem for Saddam Hussein of Iraq. After
eight years of war with Iran, ended by a cease-fire, his country
was powerful but broke. Oil prices and oil revenues were falling.
</P>
<P>
Saddam found a pair of villains _ Kuwait, his wartime supporter
and financier, and the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait is just across
the border; the UAE is tucked away on the other side of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the UAE were in fact, as Saddam Hussein charged,
exceeding their OPEC oil production quotas by over a million
barrels a day and thus helping to keep oil prices depressed. Oil
was bringing $14 a barrel, 20 percent lower than the year before.
</P>
<P>
That was the background to the events that brought out the
battleships, the troops _ and the gas masks.
</P>
<P>
July 17: Saddam uses the 22nd anniversary of the coup that
brought his Baath Party to power to lay out his demands. He wants
Kuwait to forgive $15 billion in loans extended during the
Iran-Iraq war. And he wants Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to
pay $14 billion to compensate for what he says Iraq lost due to low
oil prices.
``If words fail to protect Iraqis, something effective must be
done to return things to their natural course and return usurped
rights to their owners,'' he says. ``Iraqis will not forget the
maxim that cutting necks is better than cutting the means of
living. Oh, God Almighty, be witness that we have warned them.''
July 18: A letter from Saddam's foreign minister to the Arab
League accuses Kuwait of having stolen $2.4 billion worth of
petroleum over the past decade from an Iraqi oil field along the
two nations' disputed border.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait puts its 20,000-man army on alert.
</P>
<P>
July 19: Kuwait cancels its state of alert. ``It was all a
summer cloud that has been blown away,'' says an unidentified
Kuwaiti source who turns out to be monumentally wrong.
</P>
<P>
July 20: Thousands of Kuwaiti workers in Iraq, sensing trouble,
head home.
</P>
<P>
July 22: A pro-government newspaper in Iran, in a surprise show
of support for a former enemy, says a ``means of punishment against
quota violators seems a necessity.''
July 23: Unconfirmed reports say that Iraq has massed 30,000
troops to its border and that the Pentagon has put its warships in
the Persian Gulf on alert.
</P>
<P>
July 24: Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil. Kuwait
reinstates its alert. The Pentagon announces naval exercises in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
July 25: President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, seeking to carve out
a peacemaker's role, says Iraq and Kuwait have agreed to send
delegations to the Saudi Arabian summer capital of Jiddah to
discuss their differences.
</P>
<P>
July 27: At a tense meeting in Geneva, OPEC agrees to limit oil
production and raise its target price by $3 to $21 a barrel. Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates promise to abide by the new production
quotas. Because of Iraq's threats to use force against countries
that ignore the limits, industry observers expect the measure, this
time, to stick.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the House and Senate defy Bush administration
opposition and vote for economic sanctions against Iraq. These
reflect an accumulation of complaints over Iraq's attempt to
intimidate neighbors, its human rights record, its use of poison
gas during the Iran-Iraq war against its Kurdish minority, its
drive to build nuclear weapons. The State Department says the votes
will not be helpful to diplomatic efforts to modify Saddam's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
Aug. 1 _ Talks in Jiddah start with an embrace. But two hours
later, they break off. The Iraqi delegation walks out, saying they
did not sense ``any seriousness'' from the Kuwaitis. Tensions _ and
oil prices _ rise.
</P>
<P>
Aug. 2 (7 p.m. EDT Aug. 1) _ Tank-led Iraqi infantry units storm
into Kuwait. They advance unchecked down a highway across the flat
desert terrain to the capital, Kuwait city.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times says the advance is so unchallenged that
some troops travelled down the road by bus. The emir, Sheik Jabir,
flees by helicopter. Kuwait's hopelessly outnumbered troops wage
pitched battles around the sheik's residential palace. The sheik's
younger brother is reported to have been killed defending the
palace.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's crown prince and premier, Sheik Saad al-Abdallah Al
Sabah, goes on the radio and television and calls for resistance:
``Let them taste the chalice of death.''
Kuwait calls for urgent American military assistance but Iraq
threatens to turn Kuwait into a ``graveyard'' if an outside power
intervenes.
</P>
<P>
The invasion seems to catch Washington by surprise, but the CIA
takes the unusual step of issuing a statement saying it was not
surprised and had ``provided policy-makers with very useful and
timely information.''
President Bush reacts swiftly. First he condemns Saddam's
``naked aggression.'' Then he engineers a United Nations-sanctioned
embargo of Iraq. Finally, he commits massive American force, the
largest dispatched since the Vietnam war, to protect Saudi Arabia
from Kuwait's fate. He says they will serve until Saddam withdraws
from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
By now the story has captured America's attention. The latest
developments are writ large on the front pages.

<P>
Cracks appeared Tuesday in the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq
as Saddam Hussein sought to circumvent the economic noose around
his country.
</P>
<P>
Japan, meanwhile, announced it would increase its aid to
countries hardest hit by enforcing the sanctions. Hoping to defuse
criticism that it is not doing its share to oppose Baghdad, Japan
said up to $2 billion in aid may be sent to nations most affected
by the U.N. embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
President Bush on Tuesday night promised a joint session of
Congress and a nationwide radio and television audience that
``Saddam Hussein will fail'' to make his conquest of Kuwait
permanent.
``America must stand up to aggression, and we will,'' said Bush,
who added that the U.S. military may remain in the Saudi Arabian
desert indefinitely.
``I cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq
to withdraw from Kuwait,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 U.S. troops have been sent to the Persian Gulf
region to deter a possible Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Bush's aides said the president would follow his address to
Congress with a televised message for the Iraqi people, declaring
the world is united against their government's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saddam had offered Bush time on Iraqi TV.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and Namibia, the first of the developing nations
to respond to an offer Monday by Saddam of free oil _ in exchange
for sending their own tankers to get it _ said no to the Iraqi
leader.
</P>
<P>
Saddam's offer was seen as a none-too-subtle attempt to bypass
the U.N. embargo, in effect since four days after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, by getting poor countries to dock their tankers
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But according to a State Department survey, Cuba and Romania
have struck oil deals with Iraq and companies elsewhere are trying
to continue trade with Baghdad, all in defiance of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Romania denies the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The report, made available to The Associated Press, said some
Eastern European countries also are trying to maintain their
military sales to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source in Tehran told The Associated Press that
Iran has agreed to an Iraqi request to exchange food and medicine
for up to 200,000 barrels of refined oil a day and cash payments.
</P>
<P>
There was no official comment from Tehran or Baghdad on the
reported food-for-oil deal.
</P>
<P>
But the source, who requested anonymity, said the deal was
struck during Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz's visit Sunday to
Tehran, the first by a senior Iraqi official since the 1980-88 gulf
war. After the visit, the two countries announced they would resume
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed oil industry sources in the region, contacted by
The AP, said that although Iran is a major oil exporter itself, it
currently has to import about 150,000 barrels of refined oil a day
for domestic use because of damages to refineries in the gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Along similar lines, ABC News reported that following Aziz's
visit, Iraq is apparently prepared to give Iran all the oil it
wants to make up for the damage Iraq inflicted on Iran during their
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, met in Moscow
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, two days after
the U.S.-Soviet summit that produced a joint demand that Iraq
withdraw from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Bush encouraged Mikhail Gorbachev to withdraw
190 Soviet military specialists from Iraq, where they remain to
fulfill contracts. Shevardnadze told the Soviet parliament Tuesday
the specialists had not reneged on those contracts for fear it
would jeopardize the 5,800 Soviet citizens in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush said his heart went out to the families of
the hundreds of Americans held hostage by Iraq, but he declared,
``Our policy cannot change, and it will not change. America and the
world will not be blackmailed.''
The president added: ``Vital issues of principle are at stake.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face
of the Earth.''
In other developments:
_A U.S. diplomat in Baghdad said Tuesday up to 800 Americans and
Britons will fly out of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait this week, most of
them women and children leaving their husbands behind. Saddam has
said he is keeping foreign men as human shields against attack.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a planeload of 164 Westerners arrived in Baltimore
from Iraq. Evacuees spoke of food shortages in Kuwait, nighttime
gunfire and Iraqi roundups of young people suspected of involvement
in the resistance.
``There is no law and order,'' said Thuraya, 19, who would not
give her last name. ``A soldier can rape a father's daughter in
front of him and he can't do anything about it.''
_The State Department said Iraq had told U.S. officials that
American males residing in Iraq and Kuwait who were born in Arab
countries will be allowed to leave. Iraq generally has not let
American males leave. It was not known how many men the Iraqi move
could affect.
_A Pentagon spokesman said ``some increase in military
activity'' had been detected inside Iraq near its borders with
Turkey and Syria. He said there was little indication hostilities
are imminent.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the cost of the U.S. military
buildup in the Middle East was rising above the $1 billion-a-month
estimate generally used by government officials. He said the total
cost _ if no shooting war breaks out _ could total $15 billion in
the next fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
Cheney promised disgruntled lawmakers ``a significant increase''
in help from Arab nations and other U.S. allies for Operation
Desert Shield.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which has been accused of responding too slowly to the
crisis in the gulf, said Tuesday it may give $2 billion to Egypt,
Jordan and Turkey, hit hardest by the U.N. prohibition on trade
with Iraq.
``The pressure from abroad is getting so strong,'' said Hiroyasu
Horio, an official with the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Local news reports said the aid would be extended through the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and $600 million would
be sent as early as mid-September.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady visited Tokyo on a
world tour seeking $10.5 billion to help Egypt, Jordan and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Japan has already promised a $1 billion aid package for
multinational peacekeeping forces in Saudi Arabia, including food,
water, vehicles and prefabricated housing for non-military uses.
</P>
<P>
But critics in the United States have said Japan should do more
because its economy depends heavily on oil from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Japan imports 99 percent of its oil.
</P>
<P>
Japan's constitution bans the use of force in settling
international disputes and Japanese law restricts the military to
Japanese territory, except for ceremonial occasions.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Saddam offered developing nations free oil if they
would send their tankers to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
The first two countries to respond Tuesday _ the Philippines and
Namibia _ said no. Manila said it had already fulfilled its oil
requirements, and Namibia said it would not ``sell its
sovereignty'' for Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez dismissed Saddam's
offer of free oil as a ``propaganda ploy.'' Venezuela, an OPEC
member, has led a drive among oil-producing nations to boost
production to make up for the shortfall caused by the loss of Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil from the world market.
</P>
<P>
Their oil makes up 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. Only
Saudi Arabia has higher reserves.
</P>
<P>
But according to the State Department, Cuba, which faces an oil
deficit because of reduced Soviet deliveries, has received a
shipment of Iraqi petroleum since U.N. sanctions were imposed five
weeks ago. And Romania, it said, expects to receive oil indirectly
from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Romania's ambassador to the United States, Virgil
Constantinescu, denied that claim Tuesday, calling it ``absolutely
false and without foundation.''

TEXT OF BUSH'S TALK TO IRAQI PEOPLE: 'I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU WANT WAR' 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is the text of President Bush's address to the people of Iraq, as released 
by the White House: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm here today to explain to the people of Iraq why the United States and the 
world community has responded the way it has to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. My 
purpose is not to trade accusations, not to escalate the war of words, but to 
speak with candor about what has caused this crisis that confronts us. Let 
there be no misunderstanding. We have no quarrel with the people of Iraq. I've 
said many times, and I will repeat right now, our only object is to oppose the 
invasion ordered by Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 2, your leadership made its decision to invade, an unprovoked attack on 
a small nation that posed no threat to your own. Kuwait was the victim; Iraq, 
the aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
And the world met Iraq's invasion with a chorus of condemnation, unanimous 
resolutions in the United Nations. Twenty-seven states, rich and poor, Arab, 
Muslim, Asian and African, have answered the call of Saudi Arabia and free 
Kuwait and sent forces to the gulf region to defend against Iraq. For the first 
time in history, 13 states of the Arab League, representing 80% of the Arab 
Nation, have condemned a brother Arab state. Today, opposed by world opinion, 
Iraq stands isolated and alone. 
</P>
<P>
I do not believe that you, the people of Iraq, want war. You've borne untold 
suffering and hardship during eight long years of war with Iran. A war that 
touched the life of every single Iraqi citizen. A war that took the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of young men, the bright promise of an entire generation. 
No one knows better than you the incalculable costs of war, the ultimate cost 
when a nation's vast potential and vital energies are consumed by conflict. No 
one knows what Iraq might be today, what prosperity and peace you might enjoy 
had your leaders not plunged you into war. 
</P>
<P>
Now, once again, Iraq finds itself on the brink of war. Once again, the same 
Iraqi leadership has miscalculated. Once again, the Iraqi people face tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein has told you that Iraqi troops were invited into Kuwait. That's 
not true. In fact, in the face of far superior force, the people of Kuwait are 
bravely resisting this occupation. Your own returning soldiers will tell you 
the Kuwaitis are fighting valiantly in any way they can. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and 
America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world. When (Soviet) President 
(Mikhail S.) Gorbachev and I met at Helsinki we agreed that no peaceful 
international order is possible if larger states can devour their neighbors. 
Never before has world opinion been so solidly united against aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, until the invasion of Kuwait, has the United States been opposed to Iraq. 
In the past, the United States has helped Iraq import billions of dollars worth 
of food and other commodities. And the war with Iran would not have ended two 
years ago without U.S. support and sponsorship in the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein tells you the occupation of Kuwait will benefit the poorer 
nations of the world. In fact, the occupation of Kuwait is helping no one and 
is now hurting you, the Iraqi people, and countless others of the world's poor. 
Instead of acquiring new oil wells by annexing Kuwait, this misguided act of 
aggression will cost Iraq over $20 billion a year in lost oil revenues. Because 
of Iraq's aggression, hundreds of thousands of innocent foreign workers are 
fleeing Kuwait and Iraq. They are stranded on Iraq's borders, without shelter, 
without food, without medicine, with no way home. These refugees are suffering, 
and this is shameful. 
</P>
<P>
But even worse, others are being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait. Hostage 
taking punishes the innocent and separates families. It is barbaric. It will 
not work. And it will not affect my ability to make tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
I do not want to add to the suffering of the people of Iraq. The United Nations 
has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish the Iraqi people, but as a 
peaceful means to convince your leadership to withdraw from Kuwait. That 
decision is in the hands of Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The pain you now experience is a direct result of the path your leadership has 
chosen. When Iraq returns to the path of peace, when Iraqi troops withdraw from 
Kuwait, when that country's rightful government is restored, when all 
foreigners held against their will are released, then, and then alone will the 
world end the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps your leaders do not appreciate the strength of the forces united 
against them. Let me say clearly, there is no way Iraq can win. Ultimately, 
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
No one - not the American people, not this President - wants war. But there 
are times when a country, when all countries who value the principles of 
sovereignty and independence, must stand against aggression. As Americans, 
we're slow to raise our hand in anger and eager to explore every peaceful means 
of settling our disputes. But when we have exhausted every alternative, when 
conflict is thrust upon us, there is no nation on Earth with greater resolve or 
stronger steadiness of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The actions of your leadership have put Iraq at odds with the world community. 
But while those actions have brought us to the brink of conflict, war is not 
inevitable. It is still possible to bring this crisis to a peaceful end. 
</P>
<P>
When we stand with Kuwait against aggression, we stand for a principle well 
understood in the Arab world. Let me quote the words of one Arab leader - 
Saddam Hussein himself: "An Arab country does not have the right to occupy 
another Arab country. God forbid, if Iraq should deviate from the right path, 
we would want Arabs to send their armies to put things right. If Iraq should 
become intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelm another Arab state, the 
Arabs would be right to deploy their armies to check it." 
</P>
<P>
Those are the words of your leader, Saddam Hussein, spoken on Nov. 28, 1988, in 
a speech to Arab lawyers. Today, two years later, Saddam has invaded and 
occupied a member of the United Nations and the Arab League. The world will not 
allow this aggression to stand. Iraq must get out of Kuwait - for the sake of 
principle, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the Iraqi people.

A historic resolution;    "The Security Council ...mindful of its duties and
responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance
and preservation of international, peace and security...authorizes member
states cooperating with the government of Kuwait, unless Iraqon or before 15
January, 1991 fully implements... the foregoing resolutions, to use all
necessary means... to restore international peace and security in the area."  
</P>
<P>
United Nations Security Council;    November 29, 1990;    ...; War Pros;
Here are the major justifications for war that have been advanced by Bush or
his supporters:; Counter aggression:; Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait has
posed the first crisis of the post-Cold War world. If a new, peaceful
international order is to be established, Iraq's aggression must be rebuffed
quickly and decisively.; Sanctions won't work:; Although sanctions have shut
down Iraq's trade and squeezed its economy, they could take a year or more to
inflict widespread hardship. By then, the alliance against Iraq could crack,
weakening international resolve. There also could be no guarantee that
sanctions will force Saddam to pull out of Kuwait.; Oil:; About one-fourth of
the world's crude oil comes from the Middle East, and about two-thirds of the
world's oil reserves are in the region. With its occupation of Kuwait, Iraq
now controls about 20 percent of the world's reserves. If allowed to corner
the world energy market, Saddam could threaten access to oil at reasonable
prices.; Iraq's weaponry:; Iraq which has a stockpile of chemical weapons and
is developing biological and nuclear weapons, could one day threaten the
security of other oil-rich Arab countries and Israel if its arsenal is not
destroyed now.; Military readiness:; U.S. forces, which will eventually total
some 430,000, will not be able to maintain their readiness indefinitely. The
onset of blistering hot weather will also make U.S. ground operations
difficult between March and October.;   
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; War Cons; Here
are some of the main reasons cited by Bush's critics for not going to war.;   
World cop:; Once again, the United States is bearing a disproportionate share
of the burden of combating aggression. By some estimates U.S. soldiers would
suffer 90 percent of the casualties in a war.; Let sanctions work:; More than
90 percent of Iraq's imports and 97 percent of its exports have been shut off,
which should eventually cripple the nation. But even if war becomes necessary
to force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, it would be better to wage it after the
sanctions have weakened the Iraqi army and air force, depriving them of spare
parts and supplies.; Oil:; Most of the oil output from Iraq and Kuwait could
be saved through tougher fuel conservation measures. Cheap oil isn't worth
fighting over. Indeed, a war would make the price of oil skyrocket and Iraq
could damage production in Saudi Arabia, which pumps more oil than Iraq and
Kuwait combined.; U.S.-Arab relations:; Even if defeated, Saddam could emerge
a hero to Arab masses. Fundamentalists in the Middle East would be emboldened,
U.S. allies would be threatened and anti-American resentment would be
heightened.; Kuwait: Before Iraq's invasion, the Bush administration took no
position on Iraq's border dispute with Kuwait. Now Kuwait has been redefined
as a vital interest of the United States. Some of Iraq's differences with
Kuwait may be legitimate.;   
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; HOW THE WAR MIGHT
</P>
<P>
UNFOLD; PHASE 1 (DAY ONE TO THREE) (includes small graphics);    Objective:
Destroy the country's air defense systems, air force installations and command
centers through bombing raids, cutting off most of the Iraqi troops from
Baghdad's central command. Attack and kill Saddam Hussein. Radar-jamming
planes such as the F-4G and EC-130 would disrupt Iraqi communications
equipment.;    F-16 fighters would launch air-to-surface missiles to take out
Iraqi missile sites that could pose a threat to Saudi Arabia or Israel. Those
attacks would be followed immediately by strikes from the Stealth and F-111s
from Saudi Arabia, as well as Navy A-6 fighter-bombers from ships in the
gulf.;    B-52s from Saudi Arabia and the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia
would take out the layers of radar, surface-to-air missiles and air defense
guns that protect Iraq's major cities and military and industrial
Installations.;    Air Force F-15s and F-16s from Saudi Arabia and F-14s from
ships in the gulf would try to destroy Iraqi combat planes. Warplanes would
attack Saddam at likely locations in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.;   
Obstacles: The key problem would be disabling Iraqi rocket launchers and array
of anti-aircraft artillery.; ...; PHASE 2 (DAY FOUR TO SIX);    Objective: To
eradicate Iraq's chemical sites and nuclear research facilities. Raids on
Iraqi ground troops and an initial Infantry thrust would begin.;    F-111s,
based in Turkey, would destroy northern and western targets, while F-111s in
Saudi Arabia would demolish southern targets.;    Having rid the Iraqi skies
of planes, aircraft would conduct low-level bombings of sites in both Kuwait
and Iraq, where troops have dug in. The hope Is that such firepower, never
experienced by Iraqi troops, would demoralize them.;    U.S. Army and Marine
infantry would begin their advance into Iraq from Saudi Arabia. With Iraq's
ground forces stunned, Turkish and Syrian troops amassed on the northern
border would invade.;    Obstacles: Though most Iraqi air defenses and forces
could be eliminated, many of the country's enormous supply of air defense guns
would be functional and deadly. Also, much of the U.S. technology, including
the Stealth, hasn't been fully battle-tested.; ...; PHASE 3 (DAY SEVEN TO 90);
Objective: To liberate Kuwait by isolating it and overcoming the Iraqi
troops there.;    U.S.-led forces would use aircraft such as the A-10
Thunderbolt (Warthogs) and Apache helicopters to smash Iraqi tanks and
undermine resistance to ground forces, both in Kuwait and Iraq.;   
Paratroopers would be dropped behind the Iraqi lines in Kuwait.;    Marines
would attempt another amphibious amphibious assault on the shore of Kuwait.;  
Alliance troops on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border would push across it, slowly
smashing and pushing aside the fortifications the Iraqis have set up along the
frontier.;    The alliance forces Would attempt to engage the elite Republican
guard forces, which number some 105,000, most of which are stationed near
Basra.;    Obstacles: The Iraqi troops are war-tested and have the home
advantage: Protecting Iraq and what they believe to be an extension of their
nation's territory. Iraq could use chemical weapons, which U.S. and Arab
forces could only partially counter. More likely to bog down the alliance is
the static defense line the Iraqis have built up around Kuwait, which include
concrete trenches;   
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
FORCES IN THE GULF; Iraqi forces total 1,030,000. A militia may number as many
as 5 million Iraqis. President Saddam Hussein's armaments include 5,500 tanks,
3,500 heavy artillery and more than 500 combat aircraft, along with other
equipment. He is up against an array of International troops and firepower,
some of which is listed below.; Superpowers (includes map); United States:
More than 430,000 military troops or personnel are in the gulf region or on
the way. Deployments could be pushed higher in the event of war. The American
fleet in the gulf and Arabian Sea waters immediately outside totals about 50
ships. The Pentagon has also sent Stealth fighter-bombers and hundreds of
other aircraft.; Soviet Union: One destroyer and an anti-submarine ship.;   
...; Europe (includes map); Belgium: Two mine hunters and a supply ship.;
Britain: Has a flotilla of 10 ships in the gulf and has contributed three
warships, plus about 40 bombers and fighter-jets. Some 35,000 troops sent by
mid-January.; Czechoslovakia: Two hundred chemical warfare experts.; Denmark:
Sent one corvette warship.; France: Fourteen ships, in the gulf or en route,
including the aircraft carrier Clemenceau with anti-tank helicopters, a guided
missile cruiser and two destroyers equipped with anti-ship Exocet missiles,
two frigates and one corvette. A force of 10,000 by mid-January.; Greece: Has
pledged to send its top frigate, the Limos, with a 180-member crew.; Italy:
Two frigates and a support ship are in the gulf. Two corvette warships are in
the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Turkey.; Netherlands: Has sent one
air defense frigate and one standard frigate. The Dutch navy has sent six
Stinger missiles.; Portugal: Sent a naval support ship.; Spain: Sent one
frigate and two corvette warships.; Germany: Has provided ships to transport
U.S. troops, air fighters to Turkey and promised $2 billion toward
multinational forces, though little money has been received.; ...; Asia
(includes map); Bangladesh: Two thousand troops sent.; Japan: Some $4 billion
pledged, though only $500,000 donated. Handful of medical personnel sent have
since returned.; Pakistan: Thirteen thousand troops sent.; ...; Mideast
(includes map); Egypt: Has sent 29,250 ground troops.; Gulf Cooperation
Council (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait):
In all, GCO and other local Arab troops total 150,000.; Saudi Arabia: Has sent
55,000 soldiers and assorted air and ground weaponry.; Syria: Has sent 21,000
ground troops.; ...; Other countries; Australia: Two guided-missile frigates
and a supply ship.; Canada: Two destroyers and a supply ship; Morocco: Has
sent 1,700 ground troops.; Niger: Has sent 480 ground troops.; Senegal: Has
sent 500 ground troops.;

BUSH DEMANDS PULLOUT SATURDAY
ORDER IS 'UNCONDITIONAL,' HE SAYS
IRAQ REPORTEDLY TORCHING KUWAIT

<P>
President Bush today delivered a point-blank ultimatum to Iraq, giving Saddam
Hussein until noon Saturday to "begin his immediate and unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait" or face a decisive ground assault.;    "The ball is in
his court," spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of Saddam. "The question is, what
is his answer?"  
</P>
<P>
Iraq's half-million troops must complete their withdrawal within one week,
and Baghdad must free all prisoners of war in the first 48 hours. Coalition
forces will not attack withdrawing troops, the White House said.;    Bush's
attempt to dictate terms drew strong support from congressional leaders as
well as from officials in London and Paris, key allied capitals.;    In
Moscow, officials unveiled a refinement of their day-old peace plan, moving
closer but not meeting the coalition terms. Claiming support from Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, a Soviet spokesman said the plan envisioned a
total withdrawal within 21 days of a cessation of hostilities.;    Saddam must
signal "publicly and authoritatively" his acceptance of the allied withdrawal
terms, Bush said. He accused the Iraqi leader of launching a "scorched earth
policy" in Kuwait by setting fires in the oil fields.;    There was no
immediate response from the Iraqi president, and Fitzwater said that based on
the oil-field destruction, there was "not much reason for optimism" that
Saddam was ready to quit the war.;    More than 700,000 allied troops are
deployed against Iraq in the sands of Saudi Arabia, and officials said all is
in readiness for an overwhelming assault by air, land and sea against Iraqi
forces entrenched in Kuwait.;    "Any breach will bring an instant and sharp
response from coalition forces," the spokesman said.;    "High noon" would be
marked by clocks at the United Nations, EST, and Fitzwater suggested Saddam
should communicate his acceptance of the conditions to the U.N. Noon in New
York is 8 p.m. in Saudi Arabia and 9 a.m. local time.;    At noon today, U.S.
officials summoned Iraqi diplomat Khalid Shewayish and presented the list of
requirements for a cease-fire. "This goes to Saddam Hussein," said Fitzwater,
"The ball is in his court.";    He said he wouldn't telegraph in advance when
ground action might begin.;    What's in it for Saddam?, Fitzwater was asked.
</P>
<P>
"A chance to save his country," he replied.;    Shortly after Bush issued the
allied ultimatum, a Soviet spokesman in Moscow announced a new six-point set
of provisions he said were agreed to by Aziz for a withdrawal from Kuwait.;   
The provisions include Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait within 21 days of a
cease-fire and supervision of the withdrawal by the United Nations, Vitaly
Ignatenko said.;    In his initial statement, Ignatenko made no reference to
Bush's ultimatum.;    Ignatenko told the hastily called news conference that
Soviet officials and Aziz had come up with a "number of new provisions" on the
peace proposal first set forth Thursday night.;    Ignatenko said the plan had
been passed on to Baghdad and that a final response to it from the Iraqi
leadership was anticipated.;    Asked about the response of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev to Bush's ultimatum, Ignatenko said, "It's the proposal just
outlined.";    Among the requirements for Iraq, said Fitzwater, was that
withdrawal from Kuwait City must be complete within 48 hours and from the
country of Kuwait in one week.;    Iraq also must release all prisoners of war
and third-country civilians within 48 hours and remove booby traps and mines
from Kuwait.;    Fitzwater's list did not touch on the issue of war
reparations, or discuss what military equipment, if any, the Iraqis would be
forbidden to take back to Iraq with them.;    Bush's statement was his first
public response to a Soviet-brokered peace plan - an effort the president
said he appreciated, even while he declared that it attached unacceptable
conditions on an Iraqi withdrawal.;    Bush said he had consulted with
Operation Desert Storm coalition leaders and they had agreed to the demands
for Iraq's withdrawal.;    "We must hear publicly and authoritatively his
acceptance of these terms," Bush said. He accused Saddam of launching a
"scorched earth policy" in Kuwait by setting fires in the oil fields.;    "The
time has come to make public with specificity just exactly what is required of
Iraq if a ground war is to be avoided," Bush said.;    Bush said Saddam "risks
subjecting the Iraqi people to further hardship unless the Iraqi government
complies fully" with the demands.;    At the Pentagon, a senior military
official said the diplomatic activity was not derailing the allied war plans.;
"Desert Storm continues to swirl on, regardless," the official said. "We
have our plan and we continue to follow it. Round-the-clock air attacks
continue.";    Bush made his comments as members of the allied coalition
arrayed themselves against Iraq and lawmakers were offering their own
assessments.;    Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Kurtcebe Alptemocin told
reporters before meeting with Bush at the White House that "we should not
allow him (Saddam) to withdraw heavy weapons, especially chemical weapons." He
conceded that imposing such a condition on any settlement "will be very
difficult.";    Of the original Soviet-brokered peace initiative, British
Prime Minister John Major said it was "not good enough" but still an
improvement worth studying. France said the Soviet plan "represents a step in
the right direction.";    Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the
Soviet-sponsored talks with Iraq are "not in our best interest at all.";   
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said the proposed peace plan had "very positive
aspects" but also "plenty of things wrong with it," chiefly a call for lifting
sanctions on Iraq.;    The original Soviet-Iraqi peace plan followed days of
diplomacy between Moscow and Baghdad.

SADDAM; IRAQI LEADER SEEKS TIGHTER GRIP ON POWER  
</P>
<P>
IRAQI President Saddam Hussein has sought to tighten his grip on power by
turning over key government roles to trusted family members.;    He has also
taken steps to portray Iraq as committed to "democratization" by:;    (check)
Holding autonomy talks with Kurdish leaders.;    (check) Abolishing the secret
Revolutionary Court.;    (check) Easing restrictions on travel and news
organizations.;    (check) Promising to hold elections and disband the ruling
Revolutionary Command Council.;    Threatened by the revolts of the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south, as well as rumblings in the
army, he has closed his circle around him.;    Since Iraq's defeat, Saddam has
adjusted his Cabinet twice, shifting the portfolios of longtime senior
officials and promoting others known for their loyalty to him.;    On the
surface, the reshuffling looked as if he were moving to democratize.;    In
March, for example, he relinquished the title of prime minister and gave it to
Saadun Hamadi, a Shiite who has held several important positions in the Baath
government.;    Personal loyalty seems to be the litmus test for Saddam's new
appointees:;    (check) His cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, is minister of
interior.;    (check) His half-brother, Sibawi, retains direct control of the
intelligence services.;    (check) Son-in-law and former bodyguard Hussein
Kamel al-Majid is his minister of defense.;    Publicly, Saddam is seen on
Iraqi television presiding over meetings of the Revolutionary Command Council
and visiting villages, and he has promised his people to rebuild the country
"scores of times" better than what the allied forces destroyed.;    But most
experts see Saddam's efforts as aimed at reviving relations with the outside
world and at relieving some of the pressure at home. Only the autonomy talks
with the Kurds are considered serious.; IRAQ; MONTHS OF SANCTIONS ARE TAKING
</P>
<P>
THEIR TOLL; IRAQ'S economy was severely damaged by the war, and the trade
sanctions imposed by the United Nations shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait last
August are starting to take a toll.;    Iraq is allowed to import food and
medicine under the sanctions. But until it can export its oil, it will have
little cash to obtain reasonably priced supplies of basic necessities.;   
Many of the goods coming into the country are being bought by private
businessmen with hard currency they stockpiled before the war. They must in
turn sell the goods at high prices to make a profit.;    An ambassador from a
Third World country, who spoke on condition of anonymity, predicted that if
the sanctions were continued six more months it would increase the threat of
internal unrest in Iraq.;    President Bush has said the sanctions will remain
as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. But so far, there is no clear
alternative to Saddam.;    In the meantime, government officials have told
people to brace for the worst.;    Iraqis line up for rationed food and
gasoline and try to make ends meet by taking on second jobs.;    The official
exchange rate for the Iraqi dinar is $3.20. But on the street, it takes 3 to 6
dinars to buy one dollar.;    Before sanctions were imposed in August, two
pounds of rice cost one-fifth of a dinar. Today, it costs 6 dinars. Two pounds
of meat went from 6 dinars in December to 14 now. Tea costs 15 times more now
than it did then.;    The average monthly salary is about 150 dinars, or $480
at the official exchange rate.;    Many small factories have closed or reduced
operations because of shortages.;    Businesses have been told not to expect
help from the government and to rely on their own resources.;    THE
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT; WAR LEAVES GULF IN ECOLOGICAL RUINS; THE environmental upheaval
caused by the Persian Gulf war is of such proportion and complexity that the
word "disaster" seems to trivialize it. The damage is everywhere: in air,
water, earth and fire.;    Smoke and soot continue to pour from hundreds of
oil wells set ablaze by the fleeing army of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.;  
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT; WAR-RAVAGED NATION IS SLOW TO REBUILD; KUWAIT is lacking in
leadership, stripped of its workforce, gutted of supplies and apparently in
little hurry to do anything about it.;    Hundreds of homes, shops, offices,
schools and power plants have been looted - but not leveled. The estimated
cost of rebuilding has fallen from $100 billion to about $14 billion.;    But
Kuwaiti society seems utterly directionless.;    Few government employees are
back at work. About half the old workers were foreigners, especially
Palestinians, who either fled the country during the war or have been ordered
by the Kuwaiti government to stay off work because of alleged Iraqi
sympathies. Most of the Kuwaiti employees still live abroad.;    The business
areas remain littered with rubble and broken glass. Heavy lifting and sweeping
up are the sort of menial tasks previously left to Filipinos and Bangladeshis,
most of whom left the emirate after the invasion.;    In fact, of the nearly
1.5 million foreigners who lived here a year ago, only about 250,000 remain.; 
Shortages of basic supplies such as water, electricity and hotel rooms have
hampered efforts by Western companies to make contacts and sign contracts.;   
Last week, the government announced the extension of martial law for another
month, and the prime minister ordered a crackdown on armed vigilantes who have
been rounding up foreigners suspected of collaborating with Iraqi occupation
forces.;    The government itself has contributed to the tension, holding the
first trials of alleged collaborators and handing out harsh sentences for
apparently trivial crimes.;    Western diplomats predict the regime may face
an uprising if the ruling Sabah family fails by year's end to call elections
for a new parliament.;    THE U.S. MILITARY; HIGH-TECH WEAPONS, NEW WAR PLAN
</P>
<P>
WORKED; THE Pentagon's fascination with sophisticated weaponry appears to have
won a ringing endorsement, thanks to the convincing victory over Iraq. But so
did the revolutionary restructuring of the way the Pentagon commands a war,
forged by Congress five years ago over bitter Defense Department opposition.; 
The volunteer military proved itself during the conflict, as did the Army's
AirLand Battle doctrine, a previously untested scheme for melding the Army and
Air Force into a fighting force capable of defeating a more numerous foe.;   
Many in the Pentagon are grinning ear-to-ear over the successes in the 43-day
war. But they've also had to acknowledge some unexpected lessons:;    (check)
The Air Force's A-10 Thunderbolt anti-tank plane - long denigrated by the
service for its lumbering style and ugly profile that earned it the moniker
"Warthog" - became its star.;    (check) The vital importance of adequate
ships and planes to ferry troops and weapons to battle - long derided by a
Navy more enamored of aircraft carriers and battleships - was underscored.;  
(check) The wisdom of a new law strengthening the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, although originally strenuously opposed by the military,
proved crucial to the quick, decisive triumph.;    (check) The value of at
least some aspects of the limping "star wars" program. This includes the
Patriot missiles that were used to counteract Iraqi Scud attacks, though
questions have arisen about just how effective the Patriot was in actually
destroying Scuds.;    But while establishing the prowess of American aircraft
and missiles, the war did little to answer questions about Army hardware,
including the M-1 tank and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.;    Also untested
were the Marine Corps' new machines for amphibious attack - large air-cushion
hovercraft designed to carry troops and heavy equipment from ship to shore.
</P>
<P>
While the threat of a landing tied down six Iraqi divisions defending the
Kuwait coast, there was no amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf.;   
</P>
<P>
REFUGEES; KURDS HEADING BACK TO HOMES IN NORTH IRAQ; RAGGED and weary, Iraqi
refugees are returning home at the rate of 10,000 a day.;    Roughly 1.7
million of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds fled to Iran and Turkey during civil
uprisings in late March and early April. In the last two weeks, most of those
on the Turkish border have made their way back to the principal northern Iraqi
cities of Zakho and Dohuk.;    Relief officials and allied troops Saturday
closed the last camp on the Turkish-Iraqi border. Six other camps were emptied
in recent days.;    Figures are sketchy, but the allied command estimates that
fewer than 10 percent of 450,000 Kurds who fled to the Turkish border are
still displaced.;    But there are no accurate assessments of what has
happened to 1.2 million more Kurds who settled in Iranian camps. Iranian
officials were not partners in an international relief effort to help the
Kurds, and information from that region has been difficult to verify.;    And
there are indications that thousands of southern Iraqis may never go home.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 70,000 Shiite refugees from the Basra region are believed to still be
encamped in Iran because they fear reprisals from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 other Shiites are living in a camp in Saudi Arabia.;    In all,
roughly a quarter of Iraq's 19 million people were either routed from their
homes or lost their jobs as a result of the gulf war, according to estimates
from several relief agencies.;    In the first major assessment of the war,
the environmental group Greenpeace reported last week that as many as 221,000
Iraqi people died as a result of the war and its aftermath. That toll
includes: 100,000 to 120,000 Iraqi troops; 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians;
20,000 Kurdish and Shiite insurgents; and 15,000 to 30,000 refugees.;    And a
team from Harvard University recently visited Iraq and forecast that more than
170,000 children will die in the coming months from disease and war-related
traumas.;    BURNING WELLS; 500 FIRES STILL RAGE ON KUWAITI OIL FIELDS; Crews
capped the 100th well last weekend in the smoke-darkened gloom of Kuwait's
blazing oil fields, about 20 wells ahead of schedule.;    Oil experts and
firefighters are now predicting that at least half the 500 oil fires still
blazing could be out by the end of summer.;    The four companies fighting the
fires estimate that it will take 13 more months to put out all the fires - a
much shorter amount of time than had been feared when the world first glimpsed
the awesome spectacle of Kuwait's 600 burning oil wells.;    The current pace
of two wells per day is expected to slow in the coming weeks, however, as
crews turn their attention to the most badly damaged wells. Those could take
up to a month each to control.;    Badly damaged wells will have to be
redrilled. That costs a minimum of $600,000 to $700,000 each.;    Crews have
not yet been able to enter the heart of the Burgan oil field, the most densely
drilled reservoir in the world, where as many as 300 fires are blazing
unchecked. Routes into that field are studded with unexploded cluster bombs
dropped by allied warplanes during the war and have been covered by oil
spewing from damaged wells.;    One well is burning in a blazing oil pool that
is two-thirds of a mile across and growing.;    Puffs of white smoke are
beginning to appear among the dense black clouds billowing from the fields,
ominously indicating the presence of water in the reservoir beneath. If the
water has mixed with the reservoir, Kuwait's oil will, in the future, have to
go through additional processes to strip it of its water content, increasing
production costs.;    Kuwait may lose 10 percent to 20 percent of its reserves
of about 92 billion barrels. But the country should still be producing oil
into the late 21st century.

WASHINGTON - Barely two months ago, some of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Army's top brass assembled at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., to hear
the result of a secret war game. The powerful army of
"Shattland" had plunged into the rich oil fields of
"Audialand."
Based on the maps used in the game, Shattland was Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Audialand was Saudi Arabia. And the outcome was nightmarish:
The U.S. could not overpower the enemy without wiping out
production facilities at the world's biggest oil fields,
sending the world economy into a tailspin for many months
thereafter.
Now, the U.S. faces the danger of fantasy becoming
reality, and the next 48 hours pose the most vulnerable
period. With the U.S. just beginning to convey a massive
military force to the Persian Gulf region, Iraqi ruler Saddam
Hussein has a window of opportunity of about that much time
to freely deploy his formidable army, possibly unleash his
vast chemical-weapons stockpile and test whether the West's
ships really intend to blockade his oil shipments.
</P>
<P>
"If Saddam is going to move militarily, he's going to do
it very soon," says William Cohen of Maine, the ranking
Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"He won't want to wait until we have everybody in place
there."
One flashpoint may come as soon as today, when an
Iraqi-owned supertanker attempts to take on Iraqi oil from
the Saudi oil terminal at Yanbu in the Red Sea. According to
industry and other sources, the Iraqis may be using the ship
to force a confrontation with a powerful U.S. naval force
situated near the port. The U.S. hasn't formally declared a
blockade, but U.S. forces are unlikely to simply let the
Iraqi ship pass.
</P>
<P>
Both Iraq and the U.S. yesterday appeared to move closer
to confrontation in their public statements. Iraq declared
that it had formally annexed Kuwait, dropping all pretense
that it intended to pull out of the nation it invaded last
Thursday. Referring to the buildup of Western forces in the
region, Iraq said, "We will fight your criminal force. . . .
</P>
<P>
The blood of our martyrs will burn you."
President Bush, saying that "a line has been drawn in the
sand," vowed in a televised address that he wouldn't tolerate
the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The president stressed that
U.S. troops are intended to defend the Saudi kingdom, not to
drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The president said he hopes to free Kuwait through
economic pressure on Saddam Hussein, which continued to mount
as the world's oil-consuming nations - and, just as
importantly, many of its leading oil producers - joined
together in a campaign to cut off Iraqi oil without causing
global economic dislocation.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world continued trying to sort out its response
to the action in the Middle East. Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak called for an emergency meeting in Cairo today at
which Arab leaders will agonize over whether to support
putting a multinational army in the path of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan, who had been supportive of Iraq, said
he would refuse to recognize the official annexation that
Saddam Hussein announced yesterday in Bagdhad.
</P>
<P>
The most pressing question on the minds of many now is:
Just how tough is Iraq? Its army, battle-trained and wielding
the most modern Soviet-made tanks and air-defense weapons,
has already impressed U.S. experts with the skill and
efficiency of its 2 a.m. blitzkrieg attack on Kuwait last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Its airpower is no match for the U.S. But on the ground,
where any confrontation would be likely to matter most in the
opening scenes, the Iraqi army is far from the rag-tag
assemblage it was 10 years ago when it first attacked Iran.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of facing hundreds of thousands of soldiers
in the desert is daunting enough for the U.S., but Iraq's
chemical arsenal adds an additional dimension to the threat.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis have moved surface-to-surface Scud missiles into
Kuwait - missiles that can carry chemical warheads.
</P>
<P>
President Bush yesterday singled out chemical weapons. Their
use, he said, "would be intolerable." He added: "It would be
dealt with very, very severely."
The potential U.S. response to a chemical weapons attack,
according to U.S. officials, could include raids from B-52's
now positioned on Diego Garcia, a base in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Their most likely aim would be to pulverize Iraq's most
sensitive weapons facilities, including those that produce
chemical weapons and those that are experimenting with
missiles and nuclear and biological weapons. Another possible
bombing target, of course, might be Saddam Hussein himself.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear precisely what force the U.S. is
dispatching to meet the 100,000 or more heavily-armored Iraqi
troops massed on Kuwait's border. President Bush, Secretary
of Defense Richard Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, refused to disclose
the size of the force they have committed. "We will deploy
adequate forces for the mission," said Gen. Powell.
</P>
<P>
Privately, U.S. officials say the estimates for the
eventual U.S. commitment of troops, which began landing at
Saudi bases yesterday afternoon, go as high as 40,000, and
would include a carefully-tailored mix of light and armored
units that may have to remain there for weeks or months. The
duration of the U.S. commitment will, the officials added,
depend on Iraq's response.
</P>
<P>
As time passes without an Iraqi military move, the U.S.
position grows stronger, military experts say. "Every hour
that goes by without an attack now is good," said Paul K.
</P>
<P>
Davis, director of strategy assessment at the Rand Corp. in
Santa Monica, Calif. "It indicates that he {Saddam Hussein}
is probably facing up to the fact that things have not gone
his way in the world."
Mr. Davis, who previously worked on Middle East deployment
scenarios in the Pentagon, expects that it will take "days,
not hours" for the U.S. soldiers and airmen arriving to
acclimate themselves to the hot desert arena where they may
have to fight.
</P>
<P>
The use of chemical weapons by Iraq would make the battle
conditions all the more intolerable - necessitating gas
masks and rubberized suits in an area where temperatures
regularly exceed 100 degrees. "The really appalling thing for
American forces on the ground is the fact of being forced
into anti-chemical warfare gear which will be quite
intolerable in the desert," said Elizabeth Sigmund, a British
chemical-weapon expert. "Let's hope they don't have to."
By her measure, Iraq has stockpiled thousands of tons of
mustard gas, a World War I chemical that burns the skin. It
may also have hundreds of tons of Sarin, a nerve gas
developed from insecticides by the Germans in World War II.
</P>
<P>
One drop on the skin can cause convulsions and sudden death.
</P>
<P>
Among Mr. Bush's advisors, though, Gen. Powell expressed
the most confidence about the outcome. He pointed out that
the 3,000 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division that
were now encamped in the desert, primarily to guard U.S.
fighter aircraft, have been trained to fight in heavy,
charcoal-impregnated chemical weapons gear in the deserts of
California.
</P>
<P>
Even the mere threat of chemical weapons may have a
powerful psychological effect on troops and civilians -
especially technicians in the Saudi oil fields, who are
particularly important now that the Saudis are being counted
on to increase oil output significantly.
</P>
<P>
But no one can predict the mind of Saddam Hussein. Instead
of ordering his tanks, troops and chemical warheads into
Saudi Arabia, he has the opportunity to create an incident
today, using the supertanker that arrived at the Saudi port
of Yanbu yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The port sits at the end of one of the major pipelines
from Iraq's oil fields. If, as some industry and other
officials believe, the captain demands that the Saudis honor
their contractual commitment to fill the tanker, the U.S.
will have to decide whether to stop the giant ship, using the
awesome combat power of the nearby carrier Eisenhower and its
twelve escort ships.
</P>
<P>
While pondering his water options, Saddam Hussein must
weigh his major vulnerability to attacks from the air. More
than 100 U.S. aircraft, largely F-15s coming from Langley Air
Force Base in Virginia, have already arrived to augment the
two carriers and their 80 warplanes each.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Kemp, a former National Security Council Middle
East specialist now at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, says that despite its hard-fought years
up against Iran, the Iraqi army has never before been
confronted with that kind of air power. Indeed, most of
Iran's jet fighters were either destroyed in the early days
of the war or were grounded for lack of spare parts.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're overestimating the ease with which he can
roll into Saudi Arabia," Mr. Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
Although the sudden U.S. moves to Saudi Arabia may seem
ad-hoc, they draw on the experience of many war games, such
as the one staged in Leavenworth last June by the Army
Materiel Command. The Army's Saudi games began more than ten
years ago, when U.S. and Saudi officials began to worry that
Soviet armored forces could quickly sweep down through Iran
or Iraq and take the oil fields. U.S. policy assumed then
that the Saudis would not give U.S. forces basing rights, at
least not in the initial stages of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
The real-life scenario began Saturday when, according to
Mr. Cheney, the White House began planning to send him to
Saudi Arabia. The following afternoon, he and Robert Gates,
the president's deputy advisor for national security; Paul
Wolfowitz, Mr. Cheney's top policy aide; and Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, soon to become overall commander of the growing
nucleus of U.S. forces, were aloft.
</P>
<P>
In Jeddah, after two hours of discussion, King Fahd, the
Saudi ruler, gave his approval to the military options the
U.S. officials presented. As Mr. Cheney put it, the Arab
leaders agreed that Saddam Hussein's menacing behavior
"represented a qualitative shift in the rules of behavior" in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
After the Sunday meeting, Mr. Cheney immediately called
President Bush and the president authorized him to give the
orders to the Joint Chiefs to set their plans in motion,
assigning specific U.S. units. The orders were issued Monday
evening, and the first U.S. unit to move - believed to be
the command staff of Gen. Schwarzkopf's Central Command at
Tampa, Fla. - took off at 7:30 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By midnight, paratroopers of the Ready Brigade of the 82nd
Airborne Division, the nation's most often-alerted unit, were
lining up at Pope Air Force Base in Fayetteville, N.C., to
take their places on the hard, nylon-webbing seats in the
transports that would carry them and their hastily-assembled
gear on the long trip across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, flight after flight of F-15's was taking off
from Langley Air Force Base heading east, seeking the line of
airborne tankers that were hovering, mid-ocean, to refuel
them. What military planners call the "aluminum bridge"
across the Atlantic was now in operation.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Air Force reservists - men and women with
practiced skills in the art of airlifts - were moving across
the U.S. to help prepare other units. Army reservists
prepared mechanized infantry units, which will likely use
eight fast "roll on roll off" ships to carry them across the
Atlantic and through the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
In the Indian Ocean, the Navy was moving special
pre-positioned ships toward the Gulf from their base at Diego
Garcia. They are designed to supply Marine forces, which can
be flown rapidly from U.S. bases to "marry up" with their
equipment at points where the ships arrive. Indeed, according
to the Associated Press, hundreds of marines had already
appeared last night near Khafji, an oil-terminal city near
the Saudi border with Kuwait where the Japanese-owned Arabian
Oil Co. operates. That may indicate that the job of
protecting the oil fields belongs to the Marines.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Powell dismissed concerns that the early arrivals
might face the greatest danger, saying that fighters and
attack aircraft from the carrier Independence, believed to be
in the Gulf of Oman, were close enough to the Saudi shore to
provide air cover to the arriving troops. The Eisenhower,
from its position in the Red Sea, can also hit Iraq. Soon a
third carrier task force, led by the Saratoga, will arrive in
the Eastern Mediterreanean, putting it within lethal range.
</P>
<P>
That group includes the battleship Wisconsin, carrying cruise
missiles that can be aimed precisely toward Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Each carrier hauls a kind of mini-Air Force, including
radar search planes and planes specially equipped to jam
enemy communications and radars, along with a powerful
assemblage of bombers and fighters. The planes use special
"buddy stores," or refueling kits that would allow them to
reach their targets in the area - generally more than 600
miles, or a little more than an hour's flying time, away -
and return safely.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his views of the potential enemy, Gen. Powell
said, "We view them as a capable military force. But they're
not invincible and they're not ten feet tall."

WASHINGTON - Iraq's Saddam Hussein, his options for
ending the Persian Gulf crisis growing increasingly
unpleasant, assumed the role of embattled Arab hero in
offering his first rough proposal for a negotiated end to the
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leader, in an "initiative" designed as much to
rally Arab public opinion as to launch meaningful
negotiations, announced yesterday that he will withdraw his
troops from Kuwait only if Israel withdraws from the West
Bank and Syria from Lebanon. He apparently hopes to lure
support from Arabs who have spurned him so far by suggesting
that Iraq will use its occupation of Kuwait as a lever to
solve the Arab world's most frustrating problem, the 23-year
Israeli occupation of land claimed by Palestinians.
Even as Saddam Hussein was searching for a ploy to ease
his isolation, though, the international pressure against him
clicked up another notch. The White House yesterday disclosed
that Kuwait's ousted government has formally asked the U.S.
to enforce the total trade embargo the United Nations has
imposed on Iraq, allowing the U.S. and other nations to
immediately begin stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James Baker, speaking on ABC News'
"This Week," said the Kuwaiti request gives the U.S. and
other countries "a legal basis for stopping the export of oil
and that sort of thing." The U.S. maintains that under the
U.N. charter, the Kuwaiti request triggers steps for the
collective enforcement of international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Baker declined to use the word blockade, but said that
"interdiction" of Iraqi shipments would begin "almost
instantly." In a statement, the White House said it would do
"whatever is necessary" to ensure compliance with the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Other Bush administration officials said that the
international naval force in the area - consisting of
American, British, French, Canadian, Soviet, German and
Australian ships - may be used both to stop oil exports from
leaving Iraq and Kuwait and to stop shipments of food and
other goods from going in. President Bush implied as much
yesterday when reporters asked whether the interdiction would
apply to food. The president responded, "Everything,
everything." While shying away from actually using the word
"blockade," Mr. Bush acknowledged that the U.S. and others
were trying to block shipping to Iraq. "No point getting into
all these semantics," he said. "The main thing is to stop the
oil from coming out of there."
The naval interdiction force is part of an overall
American strategy that officials say is designed to leave the
Iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of
Kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation.
</P>
<P>
Though they insist they aren't trying to lure Saddam Hussein
into an attack, officials hope that if he strikes again, the
U.S. and its allies will have such an impressive force in
place in Saudi Arabia that they will be able to crush him in
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's first option, of course, may be simply to sit tight
and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the West
can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. Speaking on the ABC
program, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the U.N.,
asserted that an embargo on Iraq could plunge the U.S. into a
"depression" and the rest of the world into an economic
"crisis."
Iraq clearly is trying to woo back more Arab support in
case the conflict drags on, hoping that its neighbors
eventually will help it survive a prolonged war of economic
attrition with the West. So Saddam Hussein on Friday tried to
scare other Arab leaders into supporting him by calling on
Arabs to rise up in a holy war against leaders who invited
American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to
protect the oil-rich kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Then yesterday, he tried to entice Arab leaders with his
proposal for a diplomatic solution linking his occupation of
Kuwait with Israel's occupation of the West Bank. The
proposal also called for replacing American and other Western
troops in Saudi Arabia with Arab forces. The Bush
administration immediately said it "categorically" rejects
the proposals. And President Bush yesterday, asked whether he
was at least glad Iraq is discussing negotiations, replied:
"I don't see anything to be pleasing in there at all."
American strategists are calculating, though, that the
trade sanctions - enforced by an effective though perhaps
undeclared naval blockade - will hold tightly enough to
convince Iraq that it will lose in the long run by simply
standing pat.
</P>
<P>
At that point, rather than go through the humiliation of
backing out of Kuwait, the Iraqis might well conclude that
they need to lash out in some way to shake things up. In that
event, Saddam Hussein appears to have three choices.
</P>
<P>
The first would be to launch the much-feared direct
invasion of Saudi Arabia, hoping to seize some Saudi oil
fields and improve his bargaining position. But that option
is growing less and less likely as thousands of American,
British, Egyptian, Syrian and Moroccan forces assemble in and
around Saudi Arabia to protect the kingdom. The Saudis even
have in their possession 48 Kuwaiti jet fighters, virtually
the entire Kuwaiti air force, which managed to escape the
Iraqi invasion, Saudi officials said. The Saudi "window of
vulnerability . . . is closing very fast," Prince Bandar bin
Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, said over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The second possibility would be to start a fight with
Israel, in hopes that all Arabs would have to move behind
Iraq in a fight against their common Israeli enemy. In such
an event, Saddam Hussein also might calculate, the Saudis
would be under pressure to kick out U.S. troops because of
America's close ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iraq could start hostilities with Israel either through a
direct attack or by attacking Jordan. Israel has publicly
declared that it will respond to an Iraqi attack on Jordan
because it won't allow Iraq's dangerous army to take control
of Jordan's long border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's third attack option would be to start an undeclared
war on the U.S. and other Western nations through terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Two Middle East terrorists with records of successful attacks
against Western targets, Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas, have ties
to Baghdad. And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in
its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam
Hussein now that he is in a confrontation with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
And Iraq still has thousands of Americans and other
Westerners under its control in Iraq and Kuwait. They aren't
being allowed to leave and could become hostages.
</P>
<P>
If Iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic
attrition, the Bush administration knows a long stalemate
could try the patience of the American public and the West in
general, and could open the possibility that moderate Arabs
- even including Saudi Arabia - might drop out of the
effort against Iraq and accept some deal from Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials have sized up Saddam Hussein as a man
who, despite some recklessness, will back down if he must.
</P>
<P>
"This is a guy who is impulsive, and therefore capable of big
miscalculations," says one senior administration official
involved in managing the crisis. The official adds, though,
that "at the same time, we think he is someone who is capable
of rational judgments when it comes to power. And when he
finds something is unprofitable, then one can see certain
accommodations."
Thus, administration aides will be trying to calculate
whether Saddam Hussein's proposed diplomatic formula for
getting out of Kuwait represents the first sign he is
searching for a way out or simply is a public relations
stunt.
</P>
<P>
There are disagreements among experts about how much
pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide he's up
against the wall and whether simple economic pressure will
ever be enough. The biggest worry is that if he decides he
needs a way out of his predicament but doesn't see a
face-saving method, he could lash out in dangerous and
unpredictable ways.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials claim they already see signs Saddam Hussein
is getting nervous. In the first days after President Bush
announced the dispatching of U.S. troops, they note, the
Iraqi leader made several nationwide addresses indirectly -
having them read by a television announcer. "That shows he's
nervous about pinpointing his location, either because he's
afraid we'll find him, or that internal enemies will," says
one U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
The unpredictability of Iraq's leader is a principal
reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a
mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia. Pentagon officials
say the goal is to put 40,000 troops in the region by the end
of the month. But the administration isn't putting any upper
limit on how high the force could go after that, calculating
that it would be a mistake to underestimate and an advantage
to keep Saddam Hussein guessing. U.S. commanders in charge of
planning for Middle East crises have indicated in the past
that they were capable of deploying as many as 300,000
troops.
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. is taking similar steps to ensure that its
naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of Iraq and
support a war if necessary. Over the weekend, Pentagon
officials confirmed reports that a fourth U.S. aircraft
carrier - the John F. Kennedy - and its powerful group of
support ships could head for the Middle East within a few
days. Three other carriers and their escort vessels already
are stationed within striking distance of Iraq or are
steaming toward the area.
</P>
<P>
But unless the military situation changes drastically,
military officials say, the most likely plan will be for the
Kennedy to eventually replace the carrier Dwight D.
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower, which has been on patrol since March and was
scheduled to return to port before hostilities erupted in
Kuwait.

<P>
WASHINGTON - Iraq agreed to withdraw its forces from
Kuwait if the U.S. and its allies accept a cease-fire in the
Persian Gulf conflict and agree to halt economic sanctions,
raising the first serious prospect that the war can be ended.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic announcement, which came after a
post-midnight negotiating session in Moscow, puts President
Bush in a political bind. He won't like the terms Iraq has
agreed to, because they clearly are designed to leave Saddam
Hussein in power with a significant military establishment
still intact. A senior administration official said last
night that the U.S. has "serious problems" with the peace
plan.
Nevertheless, the Iraqi formula came close enough to
meeting Mr. Bush's frequent demands for an "unconditional
withdrawal" that the U.S. will find it hard to dismiss it out
of hand - and equally hard to launch a bloody ground war
while the proposal remains pending. The plan actually
contains the seeds of a significant political victory for Mr.
</P>
<P>
Bush, if he can nurture it successfully. And Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said last night that the U.S. would study
the plan.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Fitzwater said that President Bush, in a lengthy
telephone conversation, told Mr. Gorbachev he has "serious
concerns" about the plan. For now, the allies will "continue
to prosecute the war," he added. In fact, some military
officials said allied bombing likely would intensify while
diplomatic maneuvering continues so that more Iraqi targets
can be destroyed before a possible cease-fire begins.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lee Hamilton, for one, last night said that while the
proposal has deficiencies it goes far enough that the U.S.
should postpone a ground war for now while continuing
military pressure in other ways. The Indiana Democrat, a
senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, admitted that
the plan presents a dilemma for the U.S., but said it "far
advances any previous proposal."
Most important, last night's plan was the first Iraqi
withdrawal offer that wasn't encumbered by any linkage to
other Middle East problems, notably the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
That has been the main sticking point that has brought prompt
Bush administration objections to past formulas from Baghdad
and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The survival of a still-potent Saddam Hussein would be a
problem not only for President Bush but for many of America's
chief allies, particularly Israel. And many leaders of Arab
coalition partners - Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria -
privately have been hoping the U.S. will proceed with the
crushing ground assault on Iraqi troops that seemed imminent
before the Iraqi announcement. Having enraged Saddam Hussein,
leaders of those Arab states aren't eager to live with him.
</P>
<P>
Yet some allied Arab officials also worry about the sight
of their American friends gunning down hundreds or thousands
of Arab soldiers from Iraq; this may leave them as torn now
as Mr. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Above all, the U.S. will be unhappy that the plan would
remove economic sanctions after only two-thirds of Iraqi
forces are withdrawn. In addition, it doesn't set a specific,
speedy timetable for a withdrawal, and it would cancel all
U.N. resolutions that provide for postwar punishment. Those
aspects of the plan might allow Saddam Hussein time to
withdraw all his military gear, and to quickly rebuild his
economy so that he can purchase new weapons.
</P>
<P>
And there are other questions. The Soviets said more
details will be announced today, which carries potential
promise and peril for the plan's success. The U.S. is also
growing suspicious of the Soviet role in rescuing its old
ally, Iraq. And it's clear that Iraq, like the U.S., isn't
going to stop its armed actions in the meantime; the Moscow
announcement barely had been delivered when Iraqi Scud
missile attacks were reported near eastern Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
So President Bush seems certain to press for changes in
the Soviet-Iraqi formula that would allow the United Nations
Security Council to leave economic sanctions in place. He'll
also want a timetable for withdrawal that would force Saddam
Hussein to leave much of his weaponry behind, as well as
assurances that the U.N. can continue pressing Iraq to pay
war reparations.
</P>
<P>
"Let's be very cautious," said Sen. Robert Dole, the
Senate minority leader and a close White House ally. "Let's
remember that Saddam Hussein may be playing a stalling game."
But Mr. Bush also now seems caught in the gap between the
formal war aims he and the United Nations have proclaimed -
which focus narrowly on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the
restoration of Kuwait's rulers - and the allies' unofficial
desire to do away with Saddam Hussein's regime along the way.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the peace plan in Moscow occurred only
hours after Saddam Hussein had delivered a defiant speech in
Baghdad in which he seemed to dare the U.S. and its allies to
launch a ground attack to drive his troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
That speech now looks as if it was an attempt to deliver a
final rhetorical blast to save face in the Arab world before
seeking a diplomatic cover for withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The eight-point Iraqi proposal, a response to a plan put
forward by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, was read by
Vitaly Ignatenko, a Soviet spokesman, around 2:30 a.m. Moscow
time (6:30 p.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to find a way out of the military conflict
in the Gulf," Mr. Ignatenko announced. He then proceeded to
outline a plan he said Iraq had accepted under which Iraq
would stage a "full and unconditional withdrawal" from
Kuwait. The pullout would begin on the second day after
hostilities stopped - an apparent reference to a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
It would occur in an unspecified, but "fixed," time frame.
</P>
<P>
U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq would be lifted once
two-thirds of the Iraqi troops had withdrawn. After the
withdrawal, the U.N. resolutions condemning and punishing
Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait would cease to exist. Once
the ceasefire had taken effect, all prisoners of war would be
released.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Iraqi forces would be monitored by
countries appointed by the U.N. Security Council that aren't
directly involved in the war. Further details of how the plan
would work were still being worked out in Moscow and are to
be forwarded to the security council sometime today.
</P>
<P>
The eight points contained some elements that Mr. Bush had
privately told Moscow just this week that he needed in any
deal, including freeing of war prisoners and a timetable for
withdrawal. If Iraq really is prepared to withdraw from
Kuwait, which it proudly proclaimed for six months as its
permanent "19th province," Mr. Bush could frame that alone as
a significant diplomatic and political victory.
</P>
<P>
It would look particularly stunning because it would have
been achieved with a surprisingly low level of U.S.
casualties - 20 U.S. soldiers killed in combat and 23
American planes lost in fighting to date. Moreover, the
administration could at least hope that the political
humiliation of a withdrawal after the damage his country has
endured would undercut Saddam Hussein at home and eventually
cause him to be toppled from within.
</P>
<P>
But the plan was vague on many details, such as just what
the timetable for withdrawal would be. And it was silent on
other points Mr. Bush sought, such as Iraqi help in clearing
mines from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have speculated all along that Saddam
Hussein might choose survival over continued occupation of
Kuwait when he thought his options were that stark. Iraq's
acceptance of the agreement suggests that, after 35 days of
ferocious bombing by U.S. and allied warplanes, the Iraqi
leader now may see that his position has become too
precarious.
</P>
<P>
But for precisely that same reason, some U.S. officials
have grown increasingly eager to press on with the war to
finish off Iraq's military machine while the chance is
available. What's more, officials suggest that they have
hoped not only to drive his forces out of Kuwait but also to
deliver a death blow along the way to the elite Republican
Guard that have been instrumental in keeping Saddam Hussein
in power.
</P>
<P>
Officials now suggest, in fact, that a central purpose of
the land offensive wouldn't be simply to drive Iraqi troops
out of Kuwait but to destroy the Republican Guard units
sitting along the Kuwait-Iraq border. Those units are
essential to Saddam Hussein both politically and militarily,
for the Guards are his best fighters as well as the trusted
home guard that protects him from coups and military
insurrection from within.
</P>
<P>
By bloodying the Guards now, the U.S. may hope to make it
more difficult for Saddam Hussein to survive and cause
trouble down the road, even if he is left standing when the
war ends.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, officials say the relentless allied
bombardment of bridges crossing the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers has been aimed not only at cutting supply lines but
also at making it more difficult for the Guards to escape
with their heavy equipment to the north when fighting
intensifies. "They want to destroy the Republican Guard,"
said one person familiar with the thinking of the U.S.
military command in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Bush administration has to face the prospect of
giving up that hope. And that is a problem for America's Arab
friends as well. Saddam Hussein just yesterday viciously
attacked both Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Saudi
Arabian King Fahd in his radio address, calling them lackeys
of the U.S. and traitors to the Arab and Islamic worlds -
and virtually inviting their overthrow or slaying. Saudi
leaders, in particular, don't want the war to stop until
Saddam Hussein is out of power because they must share a
long, thinly guarded border with an Iraq that even now could
remain militarily more powerful than the thinly populated
Saudi kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez Assad will be equally chagrined if
Saddam Hussein, also a neighbor of Syria, is still around to
make trouble. Syria has hoped that the demise of his regime
would increase Syrian power in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Mr. Mubarak is likely to have more ambivalent
feelings. He, too, would be more comfortable if Saddam
Hussein were finished. But in Egypt, more than in Saudi
Arabia, there was growing popular sentiment not to
participate in a ground war in which Iraqi soldiers might be
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
For Israel, there also would be unhappiness if Saddam
Hussein's military machine isn't further dismantled in war.
</P>
<P>
Still, no matter how the diplomatic maneuvering turns out,
Israel already has seen the Iraqi chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons capabilities it most feared wiped out by
allied bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
For the U.S., one of the public complaints is likely to
involve the failure of the plan to comply with all 12 U.N.
resolutions passed to compel Iraq to leave Kuwait. But in
fact, many of them either aren't binding or have been
overtaken by events.
</P>
<P>
Five of the resolutions deal with various aspects of the
economic embargo. Others pertain to such matters as the
treatment of embassies in Kuwait City, which are now closed,
and to freeing Western hostages, who were released before the
war started. The murkiest U.N. statement deals with
reparations or war-crimes charges Iraq might have to face
after the war. Though the Security Council voted to hold Iraq
liable for war damages and invited countries to collect
evidence for a possible judicial process later, no such
process was actually established.
</P>
<P>
The broader dilemma is that the proposal forces Mr. Bush
to make a choice he had hoped to avoid: between the prospect
of achieving the minimum goal of freeing Kuwait without
further bloodshed, and the chance to crush President Hussein
and his military might at the risk of a bloody ground war.
</P>
<P>
By presenting Mr. Bush with that choice, Saddam Hussein
may not only be posing an agonizing decision but finally
taking a step toward splitting the extraordinary
international coalition that Mr. Bush built - many of whose
members will want to accept the Iraqi withdrawal and declare
victory.
</P>
<P>
And the Soviets, whose help was instrumental in pressing
the anti-Iraq campaign at the U.N., certainly will urge
American acceptance. That, too, poses a dilemma for Mr. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly Mr. Gorbachev's Kremlin, which is influenced
more and more by oldline military officers and party
hardliners, has seemed to want to preserve its old ally,
Saddam Hussein, to ensure Soviet influence in the Middle
East. That makes U.S. officials suspect Soviet motives as a
peacemaker - and also raises questions about whether the
diplomatic process now under way could lead to a less
hospitable new order in the region than the U.S. had once
hoped.

WASHINGTON - With the ground battle to liberate Kuwait
proceeding with surprising speed and success, Bush
administration officials are optimistic the Persian Gulf war
can begin winding down in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
The enormous ground offensive by U.S. Marines and Army
troops, at least during its first 24 hours, met only sporadic
Iraqi resistance as it quickly penetrated deep into Kuwait
and parts of Iraq, military officials said. According to
press pool reports, U.S. Marines are already on the outskirts
of Kuwait City.
"So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic
success," said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander
of U.S. forces. Similarly, while cautioning about the
uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that "the operation has
been very successful." Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi
soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also
upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a
week.
</P>
<P>
But even continued military success carries political and
diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied
rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to
avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative
from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms. But it
has offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now
believe that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise of
Saddam Hussein and the destruction of the Iraqi military, not
just the liberation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Why have a war?" asked Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs
officer in Egypt, a country participating in the attack on
Iraqi troops. "I think the Gorbachev plan was a good one.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was ready to withdraw." Now, he says, "it looks like the
West just wants to destroy Iraq."
Despite the early indications of success, the allied
forces could still suffer greater casualties and become
bogged down militarily, especially when they encounter the
tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched along the
Iraq-Kuwait border. If so, and if it appears that the
American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at
the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, "the lingering cost
of that could be high," worries former national security
adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But, he notes, "If everything
crumbles totally, that won't be such a problem."
American officials staunchly disavow any interest in
driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit of
Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled
government inside Iraq. The Americans say their battle plans
call for operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as
the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say
there isn't any plan to drive beyond that.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said
yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi
territory as part of a "pincer" movement to trap the soldiers
occupying Kuwait, but insisted, "The purpose isn't to invade
Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate."
Nevertheless, American officials over the weekend became
more open in declaring that by destroying Saddam Hussein's
military machine they hope to destroy his regime - a goal
likely to be supported by most Americans.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top
Marine in the Persian Gulf, told U.S. Marines that their goal
is to "restore {Kuwait} to its citizens." He went on to add
that "in so doing you not only return a nation to its people,
but you will destroy the war machine of a ruthless dictator."
Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC-TV's "This Week
With David Brinkley" that the series of United Nations
resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait "imply that
the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a
heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in
power in Iraq."
Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the
military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for
allied forces as it appears to have been so far. Iraq still
has the potential to cause significant problems by using
forces and weapons that don't yet seem fully engaged.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Iraq still apparently hasn't unleashed its
stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf said that
some early reports that chemical weapons were used against
allied troops turned out to be "bogus." Iraq is believed to
have the ability to deliver chemical weapons in artillery
shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops
haven't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard,
which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border
and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi
defense. It remains to be seen how much damage the allied air
campaign was able to inflict on the Guard, and whether
President Hussein will commit his most valued troops to a
fight-to-the-death finish.
</P>
<P>
Certainly Saddam Hussein continues to implore his country
to fight on. "Fight them," he urged Iraqis in a radio
address. "All Iraqis, fight them with all the power you have,
and all struggle for everything."
American war planners have long assumed that the early
stage of the ground attack, in which American forces would
use their speed to sweep around Iraqi defenses and their
strength to punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front
line, would be the easiest part.
</P>
<P>
Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground
campaign has begun almost guarantees that the Bush
administration will face fresh problems growing out of the
military situation. There are likely to be additional
American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that
President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages. U.S. and
Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of
civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by
Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or
for use later in bargaining once the war is over.
</P>
<P>
President Bush's political argument for going to a ground
war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of
wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait. U.S. officials say
that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been set
afire. And Robert Gates, Mr. Bush's deputy national security
adviser, asserted in an interview on the Cable News Network
that Iraqi troops have set fire to "large sections" of Kuwait
City.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bush and his aides were leaning toward a military
conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of
Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait came to light. The president and
his top aides tentatively decided on Feb. 11 that a ground
war would be necessary. The decision was made after Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned from a visit with military
commanders in Saudi Arabia, administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
Then, a week or so ago, Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly picked
Saturday night as the optimal time to start the offensive.
</P>
<P>
The date was unaffected by the last-ditch Soviet peace
initiative. The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S.
officials now say, was that they all would have required
lifting economic sanctions against Iraq. The Bush
administration considers the sanctions essential to keeping
Saddam Hussein under control should he survive the war.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bush forestalled further diplomatic maneuvering by
issuing an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding that
Iraq withdraw within a week, starting at noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Administration aides said that the idea of the ultimatum was
Gen. Powell's. He argued setting an explicit deadline for
Saddam Hussein to break would, when it was broken, give the
U.S. military a clear green light to proceed.
</P>
<P>
In setting out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Bush continued the intensive personal diplomacy he began
after the invasion last August. After cabling world leaders
about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline
to exit Kuwait, he offered him a week to withdraw fully,
instead of the four days he originally considered, because of
objections from some European partners that four days seemed
punitive and unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
And when he and President Gorbachev spoke about the
decision in a talk lasting nearly an hour, the President took
pains to listen to what his counterpart had to say, although
he already had decided that the Soviet alternative to the
allied deadline was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Finally, when Iraq failed to respond to the U.S.
ultimatum, Mr. Bush let the ground offensive begin as
previously planned Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The attack was lightning quick, as allied forces punched
through tall sand berms on the border and pushed forward into
Iraq and Kuwait. U.S. Marines were said to have breached
troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but Pentagon
officials said no amphibious assault on Kuwait's beaches had
begun. Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen
trudging through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S.
commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first
hours of the ground war, though some military officials later
said the total may have climbed above 8,000.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. hopes its troops will drive Iraqi forces out of
Kuwait quickly, leaving much of Iraq's offensive military
equipment destroyed or abandoned in Kuwait. It expects that
tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender to the
U.S. and its allies over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged
his country first into a fruitless eight-year-long war
against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S.
and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much
of his country's military establishment and modern
infrastructure in ruins.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. hopes, economic sanctions and an
international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq
pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages. That
would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its
armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains
in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq,
perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward
and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin
recovering from the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Outside analysts think Saddam Hussein's position is indeed
precarious. "I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter
what happens," says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar
who has written extensively about Iraq. "These guys simply
don't retire to condos over the Euphrates."
Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi
leader's internal power base appeared to be narrowing even
before the war began. Some analysts say he appeared to be
relying on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and
relatives. If that's true, the narrowing of his support would
make it easier for someone to push him aside from within.
</P>
<P>
Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to
destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein's support within the
Iraqi military. And the U.S. now will face sharper questions
in the Arab world since it didn't back the peace proposals
worked out in Moscow. "We looked to the United States, we
expected you to have the moral edge," says Nasser Tahboub, a
Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a
doctorate in political science from Duke University. "Now we
see that edge eroded. For me, it is a great tragedy. For the
first time in history, the U.S. has gone to war with an Arab
and Muslim nation, and we know a peaceful solution was in
reach."

WASHINGTON - Allied forces entered Kuwait City last
night, while U.S. troops in Iraq began fighting Saddam
Hussein's vaunted Republican Guard, his last military unit
capable of large-scale organized resistance. The Iraqi army
began what Pentagon officials called a "full retreat"
yesterday after Saddam Hussein publicly declared that he is
ordering it out of Kuwait. But President Bush declared that
the fighting can stop only if Iraqi soldiers "lay down their
arms" and quit the battlefield without their military
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops began fleeing Kuwait City and an advance
party of Marines already has reached the U.S. Embassy there,
U.S. officials said. But they warned that one final major
battle may yet remain.
That decisive contest may have begun last night, as M1-A1
tanks of the Army's Third Armored Division swept eastward
across southern Iraq in a driving rainstorm to pummel and
defeat a Guard division.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said that early reports from the field
indicated that U.S. forces captured or neutralized a
Republican Guard mechanized division - that is, one with
mainly artillery and light armored vehicles. Before the U.S.
bombing began last month, the division had about 10,000
troops.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces suffered only a handful of casualties, the
officials said. After the confrontation with the mechanized
Guard division, U.S. forces continued to push against Guard
armored divisions along a front dozens of miles wide, the
officials said. Those divisions contain hundreds of
top-of-the-line Soviet-made T-72 tanks, and are the prize of
the Iraqi army.
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf war's final issue is rapidly becoming
just one man: Saddam Hussein. The war is continuing rather
than being ended politically because the U.S. is intent on
putting an end to the Iraqi leader as both a military threat
and an Arab hero. The trick now is to accomplish that without
making him a martyr in the process.
</P>
<P>
Yet even as the military rout continues, U.S. officials
are concluding that Saddam Hussein is unlikely to ever accept
President Bush's demand that he acquiesce to all United
Nations resolutions condemning and punishing Iraq. And they
reluctantly concede the Iraqi leader is likely to remain
standing even after his army is totally ejected from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
So the mission for U.S. forces now is to disarm and humiliate
him so thoroughly that he isn't a serious threat during what
could be a cold peace following the war. In addition, the
Bush Administration has been planning for details such as a
demilitarized zone along the Iraq-Kuwait border.
</P>
<P>
"He is trying to save the remnants of power and control in
the Middle East by every means possible," President Bush
declared in a brief address in the White House Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
"And here, too, Saddam Hussein will fail."
Those presidential remarks, aides said, were intended to
lay down the principles that will guide the U.S. and its
coalition partners in the last stages of the war. The
fighting inside Kuwait will stop, Mr. Bush declared, when
Iraqi soldiers in and around Kuwait "lay down their arms."
Aside from disarming the better half of Iraq's million-man
army that sits in and around Kuwait, the American aim is to
ensure that Saddam Hussein isn't allowed to frame the
withdrawal of his troops as a political victory. That is
precisely what he attempted to do in a radio address
yesterday in which he congratulated his soldiers for standing
up to a 30-nation coalition assembled by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bush now has plenty of cheerleaders urging him on in
the humiliation of Saddam Hussein, even among those who
doubted the wisdom of the war in the first place. Emerging
from a White House meeting yesterday, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D.,
Vt.), who last month opposed the congressional resolution
authorizing war, said, "I think that the president would make
a terrible mistake if he allowed Saddam Hussein to be in the
position where he could declare to his own people some sort
of victory, and there is no sign President Bush intends to do
that."
As Sen. Robert Dole left the meeting, he turned to the
president and urged: "Don't let Saddam Hussein off the hook."
The Pentagon is even refusing to rule out seizing or
shooting down Saddam Hussein's plane if he tries to flee
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There is a danger of overreaching. If the effort to make
Saddam Hussein lose power and face becomes too severe, the
U.S. could turn his image from that of a humiliated tyrant to
that of a victim of superpower bullying. Perhaps worse, the
allies could tarnish a victory if they seem willing to
inflict too much damage on Iraq itself in an attempt to
punish Saddam Hussein personally.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if he's a martyr, and I don't think we
should care," said former defense secretary Harold Brown.
</P>
<P>
"But if it appears that we are making the Iraqi people
martyrs, that would concern me."
The more immediate problem for U.S. officials, though, is
the final confrontation with Saddam Hussein's
90,000-man-strong Republican Guard. Despite weeks of fierce
bombing, officials say, the Guard unitsespecially their tank
divisions - remain strong. According to one Pentagon
estimate, less than 30% of the Guard's T-72 tanks were
knocked out of commission by the air war, primarily because
of Iraqi expertise in camouflaging and shielding their
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The huge allied armored corps north and west of the Guard
is the biggest combat tank force assembled since World War
II, with more than 1,300 heavy tanks and about 100,000 U.S.
and British soldiers, supported by hundreds of Apache
helicopters and A-10 jets.
</P>
<P>
Relying on night-vision goggles, infrared scopes and the
element of surprise, the fast-moving armored column sought to
flush the Guards out of their carefully camouflaged defensive
positions. At that point, facing overwhelming air power and
the cream of the allied army's tanks, Guard commanders will
have the choice of giving up or seeing their divisions
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"The plan is to do all sorts of things to force {Iraqi}
tanks into the open," Lt. Col. Terry Branham, commander of an
Apache squadron with the VII Corps, told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
"The whole corps plan is written upon that premise, that he
will have to move to come" toward advancing U.S. tank
columns.
</P>
<P>
Late last night, Pentagon officials said that contact
between U.S. and Iraqi tanks had been light, and it was too
early to tell what strategy the Guards would adopt.
</P>
<P>
Early indications were that the Republican Guard is
fighting back, even though it has been bombed for weeks, has
had its communication lines disrupted, and now faces an
allied strike force of more than 100,000 soldiers bearing
down from the west and the north. According to preliminary
reports from the front, one Pentagon official said, it
appeared that the Guard maintained discipline and that
companysize units weren't abandoning the battlefield without
orders.
</P>
<P>
As the clashes with the Guard intensified, one Army unit
captured a convoy of 50 of the big T-72 tanks trying to flee
northward toward Bagdhad, and allied forces set up a
defensive line near the Euphrates River west of Basra to
block future escape attempts.
</P>
<P>
Recently, bad weather has prevented A-10 "Warthog" jets
and and Apache attack helicopters from pounding the dug-in
armor, and the rain and clouds are expected to continue to
inhibit air raids for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
If the Iraqi tanks remain in position and refuse to
surrender, the Army's VII Corps probably will attack the
dug-in tanks with close-range, precision artillery and
missile barrages and tank volleys. Then, if the Iraqis still
don't budge, said one Pentagon official familiar with the
battle plan, infantry units now a few miles from Iraqi lines
will creep closer in Bradley fighting vehicles and lob
explosives into the Iraqi trenches and underground shelters.
</P>
<P>
More broadly, U.S. commanders reported yesterday that
allied forces have destroyed or rendered ineffective 21 Iraqi
divisions, more than half the total in and around Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein apparently was hoping to stop this
devastation yesterday with a radio address to his troops and
nation in which he said that Iraqi troops are withdrawing
from Kuwait but that Iraqis should be proud to have stood up
to a 30-nation coalition. He also didn't appear to entirely
give up his claim to Kuwait as a province of Iraq, saying
that the country was annexed on Aug. 8 and "became part of
Iraq legally, constitutionally and actually," while adding
that the situation will change with the pullout.
</P>
<P>
By choosing to fight the allies initially and by refusing
to clearly accept all U.N. resolutions ordering him out of
Kuwait, Saddam is "giving us every opportunity to shake the
foundations of his power," said one Bush administration
official.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are preparing to live with a hostile Saddam
Hussein for at least a while after the liberation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
They intend to push the U.N. Security Council to keep in
place economic sanctions, and State Department officials
yesterday were working on a statement warning of the
consequences Iraq will face if it continues to fire Scud
missiles at Saudi Arabia or Israel once fighting stops.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say they are well aware of the danger of
making Saddam Hussein a martyr figure through U.S. overkill,
and believe they can avoid that outcome. For starters, the
U.S. hopes that the Iraqi people themselves will conclude
that Saddam Hussein botched both his war with the U.S.-led
coalition and his various attempts to stop it once it was
underway. That, they hope, will prompt forces inside Iraq to
topple him within weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the U.S. is calculating that Saddam Hussein will
remain a sympathetic figure to those who revere him no matter
how the U.S. treats him - and that those who are skeptical
about him will become more so.
</P>
<P>
But others, including Soviet officials who have been
trying to broker a peaceful way out for their old ally, warn
of risks. Aleksander Belonogov, a Soviet deputy foreign
minister, said the Kremlin favors restoring Iraq to its
"rightful place" in the Arab world. Failure to do so "would
be a serious mistake because this would lead precisely to the
feelings of rejection that would become the nourishing base
for various revenge-seeking tendencies."
Of course, the amount of pressure the U.S. will apply
depends on how events on the battlefield play out in the next
two or three days.
</P>
<P>
While the tank battles began to the west, allied forces
continued to consolidate positions around Kuwait City, amid
numerous reports from U.S. soldiers and Kuwaiti citizens that
nearly all of the Iraqi troops already have pulled out. Navy
A-6 pilots fresh from air strikes north of Kuwait City
described the roads there as clogged with Iraqi military
vehicles fleeing toward Basra. They said the vehicles were
easy targets.
</P>
<P>
"This morning it was bumper tobumper," one pilot told pool
reporters on the carrier USS Ranger. "We hit the jackpot,"
another pilot was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rear Admiral Mike McConnell, director of intelligence for
the Joint Chiefs, said that allied forces found a document,
which he said was written to Iraq's senior generals before
the war started, ordering Iraqi troops to inflict "maximum
casualties" on U.S. troops and also to destroy Kuwaiti oil
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Thomas Kelly, director of operations for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Iraqi prisoners of war climbed to
about 30,000, but other officials said the total may be
closer to 40,000 and is growing rapidly. Allied commanders
face major problems in providing food, transportation and
medical care for what is likely to turn into well over
100,000 prisoners. Bush administration officials have said
that winning the good will of the prisoners and then sending
them back to Iraq angry at their treatment by Saddam Hussein
is likely to be an important tool in trying to unseat the
current regime.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the amount of pressure the U.S. will apply
depends on how events on the battlefield play out in the next
two or three days. The "great tank battle" against Republican
Guard units many U.S. officers anticipated "hasn't
materialized yet," said Lt. Gen. Thomas Kelly, director of
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "and whether it
will or not remains to be seen."
To the south, allied forces continued to consolidate
positions around Kuwait City, amid numerous reports from U.S.
soldiers and Kuwaiti citizens that nearly all of the Iraqi
troops already have pulled out. Navy A-6 pilots fresh from
air strikes north of Kuwait City described the roads there as
clogged with Iraqi military vehicles fleeing toward Basra.
</P>
<P>
They said the vehicles were easy targets.
</P>
<P>
"This morning it was bumper to bumper," one pilot told
pool reporters on the carrier USS Ranger. "We hit the
jackpot," another pilot was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Pentagon officials described Iraqi forces as
confused, leaderless and battle-weary, adding that the few
Guard units that have engaged in tank duels so far haven't
been "any tougher" to defeat than the rest of Saddam
Hussein's army.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Kelly said Iraqi prisoners of war climbed to about
30,000, but other officials said the total may be closer to
40,000 and is growing rapidly. Allied commanders face major
problems in providing food, transportation and medical care
for what is likely to turn into well over 100,000 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Bush administration officials have said that winning the good
will of the prisoners and then sending them back to Iraq
angry at their treatment by Saddam Hussein is likely to be an
important tool in trying to unseat the current regime.

WASHINGTON - President Bush declared victory in the
Persian Gulf war against Iraq, ending the nearly seven-month
allied struggle to free Kuwait and the campaign to crush
Saddam Hussein's army.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait is liberated. Iraq's army is defeated," the
president told the nation in a televised address last night.

"Our military objectives are met."
The president ordered a cease-fire - but a temporary one,
contingent on Iraq's freeing its captives, complying with
United Nations resolutions and taking other steps to help
defuse the region. He said that Secretary of State James
Baker will ask the Security Council to begin arranging the
war's conclusion, and that Mr. Baker will travel to the Gulf
next week for consultations on establishing a permanent
peace.
</P>
<P>
Late last night it was reported that Iraq's U.N. mission
had sent a letter to the U.N. accepting all the Security
Council resolutions on the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Although Mr. Bush took pains to note that "no one country
can claim this victory as its own," the triumph will clearly
leave the U.S., along with its friends in Egypt and Saudi
Arabia, as the dominant powers in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Yet even in the moment of victory, a whole new set of
challenges and anxieties emerges. As the final tank clashes
drew to a close it became clear that allied success came only
at a grisly cost in Iraqi lives, a reality that could
increase the volume and anger of radical voices in the
region.
</P>
<P>
No one can be sure whether the smashing U.S.-led victory
will create a region safe from aggression - or one so
bruised and disheartened it is ripe for radicalization and
destabilization. And America's longtime adversary, Iran, now
might step into a power vacuum, agitating for the departure
of Western forces, opposing Saudi oil policies favorable to
the West, and spreading its brand of Shiite fundamentalism
into a weakened Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Winning the war, in short, doesn't guarantee the peace.
</P>
<P>
"The problems, the question marks in this war have always
been political, not military," says Zbigniew Brzezinski, the
former national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
President Bush himself acknowledged the new and difficult
course ahead. "There can be and will be no solely American
answer to all these challenges," he said. "But we can assist
and support the countries of the region, and be a catalyst
for peace."
The Bush administration already is laying plans to make
sure its gains aren't squandered after the war. U.S. policy
makers are talking tentatively of securing Kuwait with
demilitarized zones and an Islamic peacekeeping force drawn
largely from Persian Gulf states and Egypt. Then the U.S.
would extract its ground forces from the region while relying
on Gulf governments to craft a new security system that could
be silently supported by Washington. The U.S. could at that
point refocus on the Arab-Israeli problem.
</P>
<P>
Before last night's cease-fire - effective at midnight
EST - allied forces yesterday were still concluding what
Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf called a "classic tank battle"
against the two remaining divisions of Saddam Hussein's
Republican Guard. That battle raged just inside Iraq to the
north of Kuwait, where a broad sweeping maneuver by U.S.,
French and British forces trapped the premier Iraqi force.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's army otherwise now lies in ruins. Following the
allies' lightning-fast ground attack and unrelenting air war,
as many as 3,700 of the roughly 4,200 tanks Iraq had in and
around Kuwait have been destroyed or captured, and well over
50,000 Iraqi soldiers have been taken prisoner, Gen.
</P>
<P>
Schwarzkopf estimated.
</P>
<P>
Early yesterday, Saddam Hussein had made another seemingly
desperate attempt to stop the fighting. In a statement read
on Baghdad Radio, Iraq finally agreed to President Bush's
demand not only to withdraw from Kuwait, but also to accept
U.N. Security Council resolutions that require Baghdad to
drop its claim to Kuwait and that make Iraq liable for paying
war reparations.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration quickly batted down that overture,
as it had every other recent Iraqi peace bid. The statement
was unacceptable, officials said, because Iraq also insisted
that the U.N. simultaneously drop the three resolutions that
imposed trade and economic sanctions. The U.S. wants to keep
those sanctions in place as long as Saddam Hussein remains in
power - one more incentive, perhaps, for the Iraqi people to
topple him.
</P>
<P>
The very terms of the cease-fire are crafted partly to
maintain negotiating pressure over Saddam Hussein. An
administration official said the U.S. doesn't expect him to
give in to all of Mr. Bush's demands of last night. But, the
official said, the administration can say it won't discuss
lifting economic sanction until Saddam Hussein takes the step
of negotiating a formal armistice.
</P>
<P>
But the postwar problems go well beyond this. "At this
point, making it very clear Saddam Hussein has been defeated
and there are no illusions about it is good - provided that
we know how to play the next phase," said William Quandt, a
former National Security Council Middle East analyst now with
the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the challenges and opportunities as they
now appear on the eve of a clear military victory:
The first order of business will be simply pacifying the
stormy border between Iraq and Kuwait. The problem is
exacerbated by the growing likelihood, acknowledged privately
by Bush administration aides, that Saddam Hussein will
survive in power for at least a while longer. The task is
made all the more difficult by new signs that he retains the
ability to launch an occasional Scud missile attack to shake
up any postwar tranquility. U.S. commanders yesterday
conceded that Iraq went into the war with far more mobile
Scud launchers than U.S. intelligence had estimated. Mr. Bush
last night emphasized that the temporary cease-fire would be
off the minute that Iraq fired any Scud missiles.
</P>
<P>
So Bush administration officials have privately planned a
series of steps to protect newly liberated Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
To insulate Kuwait from follow-on attacks, they are
discussing what one aide calls "reciprocal" demilitarized
zones along the Iraq-Kuwait border. These might be built
along the model of demilitarized zones in the Golan Heights
between Israel and Syria, which have proven highly successful
in keeping the peace.
</P>
<P>
Under those arrangements, Kuwait and Iraq would agree on
precisely what kind and how much military equipment and
troops would be allowed in specified border areas. Compliance
might be monitored by aerial surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, officials of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
military alliance of Saudi Arabia and the five smaller Gulf
Arab states, already have worked out plans for an Islamic
peacekeeping force to guard Kuwait. Its core would come from
Council states and Egypt, though other Islamic nations such
as Morocco and Pakistan might be represented.
</P>
<P>
In that way, U.S. troops could withdraw quickly from the
slice of southern Iraq that they have swept through in their
attacks on the Republican Guard. American officials insist
they haven't any interest in occupying pieces of Iraq or
trying to set up a different government there. And they say
they don't plan for U.S. forces to provide the security
blanket Kuwait needs. Removal of foreign forces would help
prevent another nightmare turn of events or the internal
disintegration of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We've been saying these are Arab matters for a specific
reason," says one Bush administration official. "We don't
want to be there. And that's not a trick."
The overall security and prestige of America's friends, of
course, is sure to be enhanced by the crushing defeat allied
forces have dealt to what was widely considered the Arab
world's best army. This particularly enhances the position of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Saudi King Fahd, who
gambled that they could defy Iraq and rely on the U.S. to
stand with them - and who now can claim that their gamble
paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
"This is almost unqualified good news" for the Egyptian
and Saudi rulers, Mr. Quandt of Brookings says. Though some
Egyptian students have violently protested Egypt's
participation, the dissent has been less than feared.
</P>
<P>
The picture is more complicated for Syria. President Hafez
Assad's power clearly is enhanced by the defeat of his
archrival next door, Saddam Hussein, and his new chumminess
with Washington.
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Assad also bucked overwhelming public opinion at
home by joining a U.S.-led military coalition. Syrians don't
love Saddam Hussein, but they aren't fond of the U.S.,
either.
</P>
<P>
In private discussions with the U.S., Syria acknowledged
that it faced serious internal unhappiness over sending
Syrian forces along on the ground attack in Kuwait. But in
the authoritarian Syrian system, public unhappiness can't be
vented. So Mr. Assad is gambling that he will be able to use
the Iraqi defeat to enhance his own strength in the region
and secure his control over Lebanon while the U.S. and other
Western countries keep silent in appreciation for his help in
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
But there's a troubling long-term question for these
American partners, and for President Bush himself: Precisely
how much anti-Western sentiment has been stirred up by the
sight of allied armies crushing Iraqi soldiers? That
sentiment could vent itself through Islamic fundamentalism, a
potential problem for Egypt and Saudi Arabia as well as for
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The air campaign against Iraq, while swift and decisive,
was more brutal than many in the region had anticipated. That
may not translate into much sympathy for Saddam Hussein -
never personally beloved in the Middle East - but it may
feed anger in the streets.
</P>
<P>
In response to the potential for a backlash, America's
regional allies are likely to put new pressure on Washington
to address the Palestinian problem. That, they will argue,
will show that the U.S. is interested in the Middle East for
more than its oil.
</P>
<P>
Yet that problem may be harder to solve now, rather than
easier. For starters, there's likely to be new resistance in
Israel, where some are already asking what this war would
have been like with a pro-Iraqi Palestinian state next door.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians' support for Saddam Hussein has only deepened
Israeli suspicions. And Yasser Arafat's pro-Iraq stand has
cost him whatever support he had in the Bush administration
and Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Jordan's open sympathy for Iraq has deeply
strained relations with the U.S., creating another impediment
to solving the Palestinian problem. Jordan has long been
considered the Arab state most likely to help identify and
shepherd moderate Palestinians into a peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
And even though U.S.-Israeli ties have been strengthened
by Israel's restraint in the face of Scud attacks, strains in
the relationship between the Shamir government and President
Bush surface easily.
</P>
<P>
During a recent Oval Office meeting between Mr. Bush and
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens, for instance, Mr. Arens
annoyed the president by complaining about how hard it was to
exercise such restraint, and implied that Israel's air force
could do a better job than America's of destroying Scud
sites. Mr. Bush and other officials were miffed that so
little appreciation was expressed for U.S. efforts to
eliminate the Iraqi military threat.
</P>
<P>
Yet an opportunity is hidden among the problems. The new
U.S. bonds with Syria and Saudi Arabia create an opening to
address the Arab-Israeli conflict on a more comprehensive
plane in which the U.S. tries first to lead Arab states to
make peace with Israel, then addresses the Palestinian issue
in that broader process.
</P>
<P>
The biggest wild card, though, may be Iran. It is
strengthened simply because its Iraqi foe has been cut down
to size. Tehran will insist on being a part of any new
Persian Gulf security system, and may use its influence
within it to agitate for expelling any Western forces from
the region.
</P>
<P>
A muscle-flexing Iran also could clash with Saudi Arabia
on oil policy. The Saudis appear willing to support oil price
moderation as they concentrate on keeping their own
production high after the war; Iran, still rebuilding from
its own debilitating war with Iraq, feels its interests are
best served by higher prices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some Middle East specialists think radical
fundamentalists within Iran will begin trying to undermine
Iraq's government by extending their influence over Shiite
areas in southern Iraq. In 1979, after the Iranian
revolution, Shiite clerics funneled money to this region,
preaching there and calling for the establishment of an
Islamic state in Iraq, which has a large Shiite population.
</P>
<P>
"If Saddam Hussein is weak enough, you'll see that kind of
thing going on again," predicts Kenneth Katzman, a former
U.S. intelligence analyst who now is a defense consultant.
</P>
<P>
Any drift toward a radical Shiite government in Iraq, in
turn, would alarm Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Katzman believes that Iranian President Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is considered a pragmatist, wouldn't
favor such actions. But he probably would have to go along,
much as he did when Iranian Revolutionary Guards sacked the
Kuwait and Saudi Embassies in Tehran following rioting in
Mecca some time ago.
</P>
<P>
Iran also may get some leverage from the nearly 150 Iraqi
warplanes "parked" in its territory. Shaul Bakhash, a George
Mason University scholar, says Iran worries that the U.S. and
Saudi Arabia will dominate postwar regional politics. Tehran
could use its control over the warplanes both to secure its
place at any regional security meeting and to press old
demands against Iraq.

The news from Iraq is bad. After the brilliant military
victory, a colossal human tragedy is emerging that is
bringing the U.S. to the edge of a political defeat. For it
is the human dimension, we all know, that shapes the verdict
of history. But don't despair; the great victory in the Gulf
war - now looking so tattered and tarnished - can yet be
saved.
</P>
<P>
The dynamics of the situation will soon force a change.
</P>
<P>
Within days, the United Nations will be compelled to
implement a massive intervention in Iraq's internal affairs,
under the term of its cease-fire. If the U.N. fails, it will
become irrelevant as the League of Nations did in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
As day follows night, the U.N. will thus move into ever
expanding confrontations and conflicts with Saddam Hussein
and his remaining military forces. Either Saddam Hussein will
win by destroying the credibility and influence of the U.N.,
or he will finally make his last mistake.
Between the invasion of Kuwait last August and the end of
the Gulf war, many brave souls inside and outside the U.S.
government worried about clever stratagems that Saddam
Hussein might employ to defeat the U.S. What if he split the
coalition by making enticing offers? What if he dragged
Israel into the war? What if he inflicted heavy casualties?
</P>
<P>
What if he suddenly withdrew from Kuwait to save his huge
army and then built nuclear weapons - as Lenin saved his
Bolshevik regime by surrendering a third of Russia to the
Germans in the Brest-Litovsk treaty? Well, Saddam Hussein may
be twice as brutal as Lenin, but he is only one-tenth as
smart.
</P>
<P>
George Bush, by contrast, developed a coherent strategy to
liberate Kuwait; backed up his diplomacy with a war plan that
provided for sufficient force to achieve a clear military
objective; obtained at every step the endorsement not only of
America's allies but - miraculously - also of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Security Council; secured public support at home and the
consent of a divided, reluctant Congress; wisely left
military campaigns and tactics to his commanders; and fended
off a last minute attempt by Mikhail Gorbachev to turn Iraq
into a Soviet protectorate.
</P>
<P>
Now, for the coming final round in "Bush vs. Saddam," I
certainly wouldn't place my bets on the half-witted Butcher
of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
To be sure, many critics now fear President Bush has
walked away from this final round, leaving Iraq a vast
disaster area, like an abandoned Chernobyl reactor, and
condemning Kurds and Shiites to choose between permanent
refugee camps, prison or death. Even if the president wanted
to, he could not walk away from Iraq's internal affairs. Not
without destroying the U.N., and thus destroying any chance
of success for his Middle East peace diplomacy; not without
inscribing "his" Gulf war on the same tablet as Woodrow
Wilson's League of Nations and Lyndon Johnson's war in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein will, of course, try to turn America's
victory into a Pyrrhic one. In an hour-long speech on March
16, he praised political pluralism, democracy and Iraq's
future contribution to stability in the Middle East. He was
appealing, it seems, to Washington's interest in some balance
among Iran, Iraq and Syria; to Ankara's concern about turmoil
on Turkey's southern border; and perhaps to friendly German
arms merchants who would again want to do business with him.
</P>
<P>
But then he hurled at his neighbors and at the world at large
acts of mass cruelty that compelled Ankara and London, Tehran
and Paris, Bonn and - yes - Washington, to recognize that
one's own moral integrity is more important than Iraq's
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Even though the Bush administration's response to the new
challenge has been mysteriously slow and inept, Saddam
Hussein's most recent depredations have killed his last
chance to plead for "magnanimity in victory," or to posture
himself as the "lesser evil," who would, at least, give us
the blessings of "stability" in Iraq. He also prevented his
few remaining supporters in the U.N. from diluting the tough
cease-fire terms.
</P>
<P>
Now the U.N. is committed to implementing the destruction
of all of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons,
longer-range ballistic missiles, and nuclear materials and
components. And once Iraq is permitted to resume oil exports,
it must contribute part of its earnings to a
U.N.-administered fund for reparations to Kuwait and other
victims of its aggression. It is most implausible that Saddam
Hussein could survive as Iraq's dictator and comply with
these terms. To become a law-abiding ward of the U.N. is too
alien to his mindset, too contrary to the thuggery that his
henchmen are forced to practice.
</P>
<P>
When Saddam Hussein is told to hand to the U.N. a list of
all his prohibited weapons as a first step in complying with
the ceasefire, he might well respond by arguing: (1) Iraq
never had any of these weapons, (2) if it had, American
bombing raids have destroyed every one of them, and (3) if
there were remaining weapons, all records have been burned by
Kurdish terrorists. But he will not refrain from using more
brutal ways as well to obstruct the implementation of the
U.N. directives. We should expect unexplained disappearances
of U.N. arms control inspectors, crashes (blamed on Kurds) of
U.N. helicopters looking for hidden chemical weapons, and the
killing of thousands of Iraqi soldiers, scientists and
technicians who might reveal the location of prohibited
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein may not realize it, but as he begins to
obstruct, violate and sabotage the U.N. implementation of the
ceasefire agreement, he must take on not just some
bureaucrats at U.N. headquarters and the U.N. flag. He must
take on George Bush and Old Glory. Since Mr. Bush has just
succeeded in turning the U.N. into a useful instrument for
enhancing world order, he can't let Saddam Hussein steal his
success. Moreover, the president will depend on the U.N. "to
put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict," a key policy goal
he announced after Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all suggestions for the Arab-Israeli conflict call
for territorial concessions by Israel in exchange for
internationally guaranteed security arrangements - the
"territory for peace" principle to which the president
referred. How could the U.S. ever help to promote such a deal
if it permitted Iraq to violate the U.N. cease-fire terms?
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. achieved total military dominance over the
Iraqi forces and now plays a leading role in the U.N., the
conditions for enforcing U.N. prohibitions on armaments are
optimal. If international security guarantees were to fail in
this instance, the deal that could be offered to Israel would
no longer be "territory for peace," but territory for a
worthless U.N. document.
</P>
<P>
Senior administration officials are saying that the Desert
Storm victory opened "a window of opportunity" for U.S. peace
efforts in the Arab-Israeli conflict. For this to be true,
Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to slam the window shut.
</P>
<P>
Five weeks ago, in his triumphant speech to Congress,
President Bush said that "our commitment to peace in the
Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait."
Indeed, it does not. The U.S. is committed to support the
U.N., and the U.N. is now committed to inserting itself
deeply into the internal affairs of Iraq. The success or
failure of this endeavor will largely determine the prospects
for peace in the Middle East. It will also determine the
final winner in the contest between George Bush and Saddam
Hussein.
