Here is a chronology of events in the first
few hours after the 12:04 a.m. (local time) March 24 grounding of
the oil tanker Exxon Valdez on a reef in Alaska's Prince William
Sound, based on Coast Guard transmissions monitored in Washington:
12:28 a.m. _ The Exxon Valdez is reported ``hard aground'' with
1.26 million barrels of North Slope crude oil and ``approximately
150,000 barrels'' initially released. Initial pollution reports are
described as ``uncertain due to darkness.''
12:30 a.m. _ Coast Guard closes Port Valdez to all traffic and
dispatches the commercial tug Stalwart from Alyeska Marine Terminal
to assist the Exxon Valdez. Two vessels designed to skim oil off
the water are ``being prepared ... for delivery and deployment.''
1 a.m. _ A pilot association boat leaves Valdez carrying Coast
Guard officers and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation
pollution personnel to the Exxon Valdez.
2:06 a.m. _ The Coast Guard notes that high tide was reached and
the ship remained moored on the reef.
2:27 a.m. _ A merchant ship reports the oil slick a half mile
south of the Exxon Valdez.
2:30 a.m. _ Coast Guard personnel arrive at the Exxon Valdez for
the first time.
3:23 a.m. _ Coast Guard officers aboard the ship report back
that 138,000 barrels of crude oil has been lost.
4:14 a.m. _ The Exxon Baton Rouge is sent to begin taking oil
from the Valdez.

<P>
Exxon crews Tuesday finished pumping the
remaining crude oil out of the tanker Exxon Valdez in preparation
for refloating and removing the source of the nation's worst-ever
oil spill.
</P>
<P>
The fugitive captain of the Exxon Valdez sent signals he was
ready to surrender to face criminal charges of operating the vessel
while drunk.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Exxon said placing an oil-catching boom around the
ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant
explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason
it took 11 hours to set the first containment line.
``The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom
the vessel. We would have lost the vessel,'' said Exxon Shipping
Co. President Frank Iarossi.
</P>
<P>
A boom wasn't placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it
wasn't available in Valdez, Exxon officials have said.
</P>
<P>
Iarossi also said Exxon has changed its policy because of the
spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is
prohibited, four hours before sailing. Authorities charged the
captain had been drinking before the Valdez sailed.
</P>
<P>
Thick oil has floated over more than 1,640 square miles and
soiled 800 miles of beach. Thousands of animals are known dead,
including 30 sea otters.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, Exxon said it had finished transferring about 42
million gallons of crude to three other ships. Another 42 million
gallons of oily waste water remained aboard the Valdez, which
spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince William
Sound when it struck a reef March 24.
</P>
<P>
The company said crews would attempt to pump air into the hold
and refloat the vessel off a reef at high tide Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
If freed, the still-leaking ship, which has eight holes some 20
feet long in its hull, will be towed to a remote and already fouled
cove for repairs.
</P>
<P>
Exxon then planned to take the ship to a port in the Far East,
or to a Portland, Ore., dry dock. Port officials there said they
weren't sure if they'd allow that, even though the $12 million
repair bill would provide about 200 jobs.
``We're not willing to trade in the environment for jobs,''
Portland port spokesman Darrel Buttice said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said Tuesday there are ``a lot of
questions that need to be answered'' before the Valdez is allowed
in.
</P>
<P>
Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances there will
be no damage to the British Columbia coast if the tanker is towed
to Oregon, and the mayor of Valdez said the ship was not welcome
back in the port where it took on the load of crude.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Environmental Protection Administrator William
Reilly said the spill could put the brakes on petroleum exploration
there and in other areas. ``We will take apart the environmental
planning for every aspect of oil development in Alaska and in other
sensitive areas where the environment potentially could be
threatened,'' he told a House appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
The family of the fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood,
said the skipper wants to surrender but is awaiting advice from his
attorney, according to Lt. Thomas Fazio, commander of the New York
State Police on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
But after Long Island law enforcement authorities waited a
second day for Hazelwood to turn himself in, the Suffolk County
district attorney's office announced there would be no surrender
that day.
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, 42, is accused operating the ship while under the
influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge
of oil. Bail was previously set in Valdez at $50,000.
</P>
<P>
Of about three dozen oil-soaked otters rescued following the
spill, about one-third have died, Alaska Department of Fish and
Game spokesman Jon Lyman said. ``Dozens of otters are dying before
rescuers can get to them,'' he said. Six otters were flown to Sea
World in San Diego on Monday for rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen counting on the sound's $12 million annual herring
industry were told Monday by the state that it will not allow a
season this year. Sablefish and shrimp fisheries in Prince William
waters also have been closed.
</P>
<P>
An effort at Sawmill Bay, 11 miles west of Valdez, to keep oil
away from a hatchery where 2 million salmon are waiting to be
released to the sea appeared to be failing. Tendrils of oil had
floated past a boom streched across the bay, said officials.
</P>
<P>
The spill has shifted public opinion in Alaska about the energy
industry, which has been lobbying for new exploration.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski, a champion of oil exploration in
Alaska, asked that plans for drilling in Bristol Bay, the state's
richest fishing grounds, be set aside until the industry can
demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills.
``The Exxon Valdez accident has taught us that simply having a
plan is not sufficient,'' the Alaska Republican said.
</P>
<P>
At the first Valdez City Council meeting since the spill, two
council members and Mayor John Devens expressed concern that anger
and frustration over the spill was surfacing as harrassment of
pipeline company workers and their children.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a multimillion-dollar class-action lawsuit was filed
Monday in federal court in California against Exxon Corp., charging
that the spill has led to gas prices of 10 to 15 cents more a
gallon for California drivers.

<P>
Exxon today refloated its still-leaking
oil tanker, whose fugitive captain surrendered a few hours earlier
to face charges of operating the vessel while drunk.
</P>
<P>
A judge in Hauppauge, N.Y., set bail at $500,000 for the
captain, 20 times as much as prosecutors had recommended, saying
``we have a manmade destruction that has not been equaled,
probably, since Hiroshima.''
With claims against Exxon for damages escalating into the
millions, U.S. Navy oil skimmers were pressed into service, and
Exxon accepted an offer of help from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Salvage crews pumped compressed air into the $125 million ship
to float it off Bligh Reef, 25 miles from the port of Valdez. From
there, it began a 30-mile journey under the control of six tugs to
a remote cove off Naked Island for temporary repairs, picking its
way through scattered icebergs.
</P>
<P>
The ship was refloated before tide reached its peak Wednesday.
``It was not just a stroke of good luck,'' said Gary Gorski,
Exxon's salvage coordinator. ``It took a lot of hard work.''
Company officials turned to the Far East in search of a dry dock
willing to accept the crippled leviathan Exxon Valdez.
</P>
<P>
As the oil off Alaska spread over 2,600 square miles, an area
larger than the state of Delaware, the fired captain of the tanker
turned himself in this morning to authorities in Hauppauge, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Hazelwood, who lives on New York's Long Island, appeared
with his attorney 12 days after his ship ran aground and nearly a
week after the National Transportation Safety Board said tests
showed he was under the influence of alcohol several hours after
the accident.
</P>
<P>
He had been sought since Sunday on a fugitive warrant for three
misdemeanor charges that carry a penalty of up to 2\ years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Alaska authorities have said they will seek his extradition.
</P>
<P>
Exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill and
now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited,
four hours before sailing.
</P>
<P>
Oil as thick as mayonnaise has soiled 800 miles of beach,
thousands of animals are known dead, including at least 30 sea
otters.
``Dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them,''
said fish and game spokesman Jon Lyman.
</P>
<P>
The dead otters included a year-old pup, one of five that had
been sent to San Diego's Sea World for treatment.
</P>
<P>
While the toll from the nation's worst oil spill mounted, its
impact on the flow of Alaskan crude was abating.
</P>
<P>
The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said it would resume a normal
daily flow of 2.1 million barrels of oil through the trans-Alaska
pipeline today. The flow had been cut by 60 percent because of
restrictions on tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, but those
restrictions have eased.
</P>
<P>
In the longer turn, though, the spill could slow petroleum
exploration in environmentally sensitive areas at least
temporarily, Environmental Protection Administrator William Reilly
told Congress.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, crews finished transferring about 42 million gallons
of crude from the crippled tanker to other ships in preparation for
the refloating. The $125 million vessel, one of Exxon's newest, had
been sitting on Bligh Reef in since running aground March 24 and
spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude.
</P>
<P>
After that, Exxon said its first choice for dry dock is
Portland, Ore., but officials there said they weren't sure if
they'd allow that, even though the $12 million repair bill would
provide about 200 jobs.
``A lot of questions that need to be answered,'' Oregon Gov.
</P>
<P>
Neil Goldschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances that towing
the tanker to Oregon won't damage the British Columbia coast.
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said the company has
had discussions with dry docks in South Korea, Japan and Singapore
about accepting the vessel. He said the ship won't trail any
pollution while it is towed.
</P>
<P>
Iarossi said Exxon had not added up its costs so far.
``Millions, multiple millions. It's going to be big numbers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
One hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages,
including 40 on Tuesday alone. The claims have come mostly from
fishermen. Exxon has settled only two so far.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 lawsuits have been filed.
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated
the leading edge of the spill was 100 miles southwest of the tanker
off the Kenai Peninsula. The spill has been pushed away from Kenai
Fjords National Park and the area south of Seward by water flowing
out of Resurrection Bay.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries within the sound remained threatened, and the slick
appeared to be oozing slowly toward other Alaskan ports.
</P>
<P>
Exxon gave $1 million on Monday to Prince William Sound
Aquaculture Corp. to buy boom to defend hatcheries, said Susan
Ogle, a spokeswoman for the Cordova spill response office.
</P>
<P>
Exxon said it has asked the State Department to notify Moscow
that it has accepted a Soviet offer of an oil skimmer. Five of the
U.S. Navy's 18 heavy-duty oil skimmers went into operation Monday,
and Exxon requested the remaining 13.
</P>
<P>
The company also said that placing an oil-catching boom around
the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a
giant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the
reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line.
``The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom
the vessel. We would have lost the vessel,'' said Iarossi.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said boom wasn't placed around the vessel
immediately because the equipment wasn't available in Valdez.

The tanker Exxon Valdez was freed
Wednesday from the reef that ripped its hull and spilled more than
10 million gallons of crude oil, and Alaska's governor asked the
Coast Guard to take over the cleanup from Exxon.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the captain of the Exxon Valdez surrendered to police
and was ordered held on $1 million bond.
</P>
<P>
Cleanup crews continued to skim mayonnaise-thick oil from Prince
William Sound, but progress was slow and the oil had spread over an
area larger than Delaware. The animal death toll rose and salmon
hatcheries remained endangered.
</P>
<P>
In Juneau, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said he asked Coast Guard
Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr. to take over the much-maligned and
slowly progressing cleanup effort from Exxon, and Nelson indicated
he would, although he has not formally approved the request.
</P>
<P>
Cowper said the Coast Guard should be better able to handle
coordination and management of the cleanup than Exxon, which he
said was too bureaucratic.
``Maybe that's been the problem all along. You need a military
system to get things done,'' the governor said.
``We appreciate the efforts of Exxon _ we think they were done
in good faith. But we think there has to be a much more disciplined
management structure,'' Cowper said at a Capitol news conference.
</P>
<P>
President Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level officials
to Valdez and determined that federal management of the cleanup
wasn't necessary. Cowper said Coast Guard management is different
from the plan Bush rejected.
</P>
<P>
Although Cowper said he didn't want to be ``extremely critical''
of Exxon, a letter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmental
official said Exxon had been unresponsive.
``Exxon has failed to provide ... the information necessary to
make sound planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil
and the protection of resources,'' wrote Lynn Kent, chief of the
state Oil and Hazardous Substance Spill Response Section.
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company disagreed with
charges it wasn't handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxon
was the best organization to manage the effort.
``We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup. We
think the most effective and efficient way to carry out this
project is (for Exxon) to continue,'' Beathard said.
</P>
<P>
Fired tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood, 42, surrendered to police
on New York's Long Island and a judge set bail at $1 million bond
or $500,000 in cash, up from a prosecutor's recommendation of
$25,000. He had been sought since Saturday on a fugitive warrant on
misdemeanor charges of operating the tanker while drunk.
``These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been
equaled, at least in this country,'' Judge Kenneth Rohl said as
Hazelwood was arraigned. ``He's got to think about that. We have a
manmade destruction that has not been equaled, probably, since
Hiroshima.''
Salvage crews pumped compressed air into the $125 million ship
and floated it off Bligh Reef, 25 miles from the port of Valdez.
</P>
<P>
From there, it began a 30-mile journey under the control of six
tugs to a remote cove off Naked Island for temporary repairs,
picking its way through scattered icebergs.
``No pollution was immediately visible. There's a real good
possibility (oil) sheen will show up, but they're ready for it,''
Coast Guard spokesman Rick Meidt said.
</P>
<P>
The ship was refloated at 10:35 a.m., hours before the tide
reached its peak Wednesday.
``It was not just a stroke of good luck,'' said Gary Gorski,
Exxon's salvage coordinator. ``It took a lot of hard work.''
Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said the company has
talked with dry docks in South Korea, Japan and Singapore about
accepting the vessel after the temporary repairs are made.
</P>
<P>
First choice is a Portland, Ore., dry dock, Iarossi said, but
Oregon officials have raised concerns about accepting the ship.
</P>
<P>
Iarossi said the ship won't trail any pollution while it is towed.
</P>
<P>
Oil has floated over 2,600 square miles, soiled 800 miles of
beach and killed thousands of animals, including at least 30 sea
otters, officials said.
``Dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them,''
said fish and game spokesman Jon Lyman.
</P>
<P>
Favorable weather, however, has kept it offshore from a national
park and additional coastline outside Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
Flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to its normal daily
flow of 2.1 million barrels Wednesday, the Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co. said. Oil flow from the North Slope had been cut by 60 percent
because the spill restricted tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, but
traffic has increased.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Mel Levine accused
the federal government of covering up the possibility of a major
spill and the ineffectiveness of cleanup technology. The California
Democrats also asked President Bush to cancel oil leasing off the
California coast pending a review of the program.
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood turned himself in with three attorneys in Hauppauge,
N.Y., and was arraigned. His lawyer said he had not decided whether
to waive extradition proceedings and return to Alaska to face the
charges.
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood is charged with operating a ship while under the
influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge
of oil. The charges carry a combined maximum penalty of 2\ years in
prison and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
FBI officials in Washington say they also are investigating
whether Hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of the
Clean Water Act, which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants
into navigable waters.
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood was fired by Exxon a week ago after the National
Transportation Safety Board said tests taken about nine hours after
the disaster showed he was drunk.
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood had been arrested twice for drunken driving and had
his license suspended three times. His mother has told The
Associated Press that her son had undergone rehabilitation and that
Exxon was aware of his drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
Exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill and
now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited,
four hours before sailing.
</P>
<P>
One hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages,
including 40 on Tuesday alone. The claims have come mostly from
fishermen. Exxon has settled only two so far. At least 14 lawsuits
have been filed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of oil-spattered workers
hampered by worsening weather have only a few more days to clean
crude oil off Alaska's petroleum-fouled shoreline before Exxon Corp.
stops work for the season.
</P>
<P>
Exxon says it will pull out the last of its workers by this
coming Friday after treating more than 1,000 miles of shoreline
tainted by the nation's worst oil spill. The company claimed
Thursday that only four miles remained to be treated, but state and
federal agencies disagree with Exxon about how much has been cleaned
and how well.
``Our position is that the weather is going to make us go
regardless of what the numbers are, regardless of how much is
left,'' said Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard.
</P>
<P>
Exxon said it chose Sept. 15 for the withdrawal of the last of
its thousands of workers and hundreds of vessels to avoid
increasingly poor weather and reduced hours of daylight. In this
land where winter comes early, the first dusting of snow can already
be seen in some higher elevations.
``We have buses and planes set up for them to leave that day,''
Beathard said. ``They don't have the option to take that free trip
three days later.'' Already, the first fall storm has raked Prince
William Sound, where the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil on March 24. Gusts to 70 mph and 6-to
10-foot seas shut down the Point Helen cleanup operation once. On
Smith Island, a test of a solvent Exxon wants to use to clean oily
shores was delayed for at least four days by the storm.
</P>
<P>
Point Helen, one of the last heavily hit shorelines on the
cleanup list, was left untouched until after mid-August to avoid
disturbing a fish hatchery at Sawmill Bay, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Weather permitting, the shore will be ``environmentally stable,''
if not clean, by Exxon's deadline, the company said.
``I'm quite confident we are going to make it _ if we can just
get a few good days of weather,'' said beachmaster Warren Winstead
of Baton Rouge, La. ``I think if we can get another few days in,
we'll beat it.''
But the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and Exxon
dispute just about everything, including how many miles have been
treated, how well the job has been done and whether Exxon plans to
duck out after giving the shore a quick once-over.
</P>
<P>
The state has sued Exxon and a half-dozen other oil companies
that get oil from Alaska's North Slope by way of the Alyeska
pipeline, claiming they were negligent in preventing and cleaning up
the spill. The Exxon Valdez was outbound from the pipeline terminal
at Valdez when it ripped its bottom open on a reef.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, environmental and fishing groups took two dozen
boats into Port Valdez for a demonstration demanding greater
protection against oil spills.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the event held with Coast Guard permission said
their main goal was to draw attention to tankers of foreign registry
that travel in and out of the port, terminus of the trans-Alaska oil
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Seven vessels that are registered in Italy, Liberia and Israel
and use the port are not regulated adequately and do not carry
sufficient liability insurance for oil-spill compensation, said
Nancy Lethcoe, vice president of the Prince William Sound
Conservation Alliance and a partner in a local tourism business. The
Coast Guard said a total of 70 tankers use the port.
</P>
<P>
Crews have removed gross contamination from many shorelines, but
they remain oily. Exxon claims about 244,000 gallons of oil and
water emulsion have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Exxon, the DEC and the Coast Guard all have different figures for
virtually everything, in part because they use different criteria
for measuring contamination and what constitutes an effective
cleanup. The state agency's figures show Exxon claiming to have
treated more shoreline than was fouled.
``We're the only people honest about the numbers,'' said Joe
Bridgeman, a DEC spokesman. ``The numbers are being manipulated to
show great shoreline progress.''
Exxon officials acknowledged discrepancies. ``I honestly don't
have an adequate explantion,'' said spokesman Karsten Rodvik.
</P>
<P>
As the cleanup operation grinds down from its peak of 12,000
workers and 1,300 vessels, Valdez officials are bracing for a
shrunken economy.
</P>
<P>
Temporary housing set up by Exxon will close. The Valdez
population likely will plunge from 13,000 to about 4,500.
</P>
<P>
Public agencies are getting ready to pare their staffs to winter
levels, although some work will continue. Scientists are studying
the effects of fertilizer spread on test beaches to stimulate the
growth of oil-eating bacteria. Other agencies plan to collect
samples and study the environment during the winter.
</P>
<P>
Otter and bird rescue operations are shutting down. More than
32,000 birds and 980 otters died from the spill's effects.
</P>
<P>
Exxon has started shipping millions of pounds of equipment to
winter storage in Anchorage, home of its Alaska headquarters.
</P>
<P>
State environmental officials say Exxon's withdrawal is premature
and that it should stay on the job as long as the weather permits.
``We don't buy the deadline. We not only want them to come back next
year. We want them to work past Sept. 15,'' Bridgeman said.
</P>
<P>
Over the winter Exxon plans to monitor how the shoreline looks.
</P>
<P>
It has made no commitment to come back next summer but says it will
abide by any reasonable decision of the Coast Guard on whether more
cleanup is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The price tag for this summer's cleanup is expected to top $1.2
billion and the effort has become an industry of its own.
</P>
<P>
Exxon's spending spree was felt statewide and helped lower
unemployment, said state labor economist Neal Fried. In Valdez and
Cordova, unemployment was about half the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
Exxon has paid more than $90 million in damage claims so far, and
is paying up to $3 million a day, about two-thirds directly to
fishermen who were kept in port by oil-covered water.
</P>
<P>
Exxon bought 302,000 pairs of rubber gloves, 167,000 sets of rain
gear, 73,000 pairs of rubber boots, 125,000 coveralls and 53,000
life vests.
</P>
<P>
The company said it purchased more than 12 million pounds of
groceries, amounting to 1,000 cows, 360,000 chickens, 1,000 turkeys
and 700 pigs. Washing machines agitated more than 3 million pounds
of laundry, and equipment consumed more than 400,000 gallons of
diesel fuel each week.

Here is a chronology of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, its cleanup
and related developments:
</P>
</TEXT>
<HEADLINE>
<HL>
1989
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
March 24: The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez runs aground on Bligh
Reef some 25 miles south of Valdez, Alaska, spilling nearly 11
million gallons of North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
March 26: Alaska fishermen's union spokeswoman Riki Ott says the
group wants full compensation for damage from the spill. More than
250 lawsuits will be filed against Exxon in the following months.
</P>
<P>
March 30: Exxon fires tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood after
tests reveal he was legally drunk 10 hours after the accident.
</P>
<P>
April 4: U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan calls the spill
the oil industry's ``Three Mile Island.'' Oil now covers 1,000
square miles, leaking out of the sound to foul beaches along the
Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet.
</P>
<P>
June 19: Exxon and other big oil companies announce plans for a
voluntary network of response teams capable of handling big spills
anywhere in U.S. coastal waters. Estimated cost: $250 million.
</P>
<P>
Sept. 15: Exxon suspends its beach cleanup for the winter,
claiming it has left 1,100 miles of oiled beaches ``environmentally
stable'' and saying its 25-week cleanup involving more than 10,000
workers was a job well done. Alaska officials disagree and announce
their own $21 million winter cleanup plan.
</P>
<P>
Oct. 10: State officials warn people not to consume shellfish in
areas affected by oil.
</P>
<P>
Oct. 27: The National Wildlife Federation says Exxon has
resigned from its corporate advisory board. Exxon calls the
conservation group unfair in its criticism of the oil spill; the
group calls Exxon ``a corporate pariah.''
Nov. 8: The U.S. House of Representatives passes a bill
preserving states' ability to adopt stricter oil spill liability
laws than the federal government. The Senate also is working on a
bill, but agreement is put off until 1990.
</P>
<P>
Dec. 4: U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
Exxon's cleanup has cost the company $1.9 billion, and praises
Exxon for ``a very substantial, good-faith effort.''
Dec. 31: Wildlife officials report that more than 1,000 sea
otters, 140 bald eagles and nearly 36,500 seabirds have been found
dead in the spill area.
</P>

<P>
Jan. 5: The Alaska Oil Spill Commission issues a report calling
for an overhaul of the nation's oil transportation system. It
blames the Valdez spill in part on the Coast Guard's ``unduly
friendly relationship with industry,'' and a reckless rush to
profits by the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Jan. 22: Hazelwood goes on trial in Anchorage, facing charges of
criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of
oil, and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
Feb. 20: The Coast Guard orders Exxon to resume its cleanup May
1 and to submit a plan by March 15.
</P>
<P>
Feb. 27: A federal grand jury indicts Exxon and its shipping
subsidiary on five criminal counts. Officials say that if convicted
on all counts, the company could be fined up to $1.6 million and
could be assessed an additional $700 million in penalties.

RADAR CREW LOST TRACK OF EXXON VALDEZ 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ANCHORAGE 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Coast Guard radar watchers testified Monday that they did not notify the 
skipper of the Exxon Valdez when the vessel sailed off their screens and did 
not try to track its progress by radio until after the tanker grounded on Bligh 
Reef. 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez was the only ship under surveillance by the Coast Guard vessel 
traffic center for hours before the March 24 wreck, but that failed to 
guarantee that radar watchers monitored its progress out of treacherous Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard radar watchman who started work 25 minutes before the grounding 
and 45 minutes before the Exxon Valdez radioed that it was aground said he 
never even tried to locate the off-course vessel because the earlier watchman, 
Gordon Taylor, said it had disappeared from radar. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Blandford testified in Alaska Superior Court that, at the first radioed 
report of the wreck, he tried for the first time to find the Exxon Valdez on 
radar and the grounded tanker showed up perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers capitalized on the testimony to demonstrate that perhaps it was 
Coast Guard negligence, not the captain's alleged drunken recklessness, that 
contributed to the grounding. Lawyers for the Coast Guard and the Justice 
Department listened intently. 
</P>
<P>
The skipper, Joseph Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., faces up to seven years 
and three months in jail and a $61,000 fine if convicted on charges of 
operating the Exxon Valdez while intoxicated, reckless endangerment, negligent 
discharge of oil and criminal mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Blandford nor Taylor notified the skipper when his ship disappeared 
from their radar screens as it sailed on a collision course with Bligh Reef, 
where it broke open and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into 
Prince William Sound last March 24. 
</P>
<P>
The two men revealed that another loaded tanker, the Arco Juneau, had taken a 
similar detour around ice four hours earlier without any problems, and thus 
they thought nothing of the Exxon Valdez leaving its prescribed tanker lane. 
Blandford said such a detour was considered routine. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Blandford said the radar was less than reliable, affected by 
snowstorms and sometimes went on the blink, working off and on near Bligh Reef, 
25 miles out. 
</P>
<P>
Blandford said the radar seemed to be deteriorating. Taylor indicated that in 
the weeks before the wreck, radar "targets were getting harder to hold onto." 
</P>
<P>
Blandford said the 987-foot Exxon tanker may have shown up on radar after the 
grounding because by then the radar had a broadside view of the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after assuming the watch, Blandford said, he left the controls for 5 
minutes to get coffee and check the weather.

HAZELWOOD ACQUITTED OF 3 CHARGES; GUILTY ON 1; 
OIL SPILL: AN ANCHORAGE JURY FINDS THE EXXON VALDEZ SKIPPER CULPABLE ONLY ON A 
MINOR POLLUTION COUNT. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ANCHORAGE 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former tanker skipper Joseph Hazelwood, accused of being drunk, reckless and 
most responsible for the nation's worst oil spill, was acquitted of all but a 
minor pollution charge by an Alaskan jury Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a crowded courtroom that included his wife and father, Hazelwood, 43, was 
found not guilty of felony mischief, operating a vessel while under the 
influence of alcohol and reckless endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
The lone guilty verdict was for the negligent discharge of oil, a misdemeanor 
carrying a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, far less than 
the 7 years and $61,000 fine he faced if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts came two days before the anniversary of the grounding of the Exxon 
Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince 
William Sound after slamming into a reef and ripping open its hull. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated less than 11 hours. Bursts of applause greeted each "not 
guilty" verdict read by Judge Karl Johnstone. Attorney Michael Chalos 
triumphantly slammed the defense table with his fist when the felony charge 
fell first. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not done. We're going to appeal that misdemeanor, but we're very happy 
that all the serious charges were rejected," Chalos said later. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the appeal results, however, legal problems stemming from the 
grounding of the Exxon Valdez will continue to haunt Hazelwood and his former 
employer, Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The company still faces federal criminal charges, and Hazelwood is named in 
about 150 civil lawsuits seeking financial damages for the oil spill that 
polluted hundreds of miles of Alaskan shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how Hazelwood's exoneration on serious criminal charges might 
affect those other cases, but state prosecutors had argued at the close of 
Hazelwood's trial that Exxon would benefit from an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were clearly swayed by defense arguments that the disastrous grounding 
was an accident, not a crime. Some members of the panel said after the verdict 
that they felt Hazelwood had been negligent, but not criminally reckless, when 
he left the bridge about 12 to 15 minutes before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded Hazelwood was as stoic in victory as he had been through more than 
seven weeks of trial, but he smiled broadly as reporters and television cameras 
mobbed the defense table moments after the jury was polled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just relieved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been long and difficult. I was a pretty anonymous character up until 
about a year ago," Hazelwood told reporters outside the courthouse. "I'm going 
to try to get on with my life now. I'd like to go back to sea. . . . It's what 
I do." 
</P>
<P>
His attorney said that Hazelwood may talk to Exxon about reinstatement and 
would fight an expected U.S. Coast Guard effort to revoke his master's license. 
"The only job he ever had was working on tankers owned or operated by Exxon, so 
I suspect that's what he wants to do is go back to work as a captain," Chalos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Morakis, a spokesman for Exxon in New York, said the company, which has 
fired Hazelwood, was "pleased that the ordeal of the trial is over for captain 
Hazelwood and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"The verdict would seem to confirm the view that the grounding of the Exxon 
Valdez was an accident," Morakis said. "In light of pending litigation, any 
other comment would be inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, jury foreman Lori Wing stood and smiled at Hazelwood, 
wishing him "good luck" before disappearing into the judge's chambers with her 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's tearful father, airline pilot Joseph O. Hazelwood, pushed through 
the media throng to embrace Chalos and greet his son. Suzanne Hazelwood, the 
former captain's wife, reached through the crowd to squeeze her husband's hand, 
then hurried from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Hazelwood at one point broke away from his attorneys to 
shake hands with one of the jurors, Jeffrey Sage, a 28-year-old grocery 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see justice done, Mr. Hazelwood," Sage said. "So am I. Thank you," 
Hazelwood responded. 
</P>
<P>
Sage, whose sister was killed by a drunk driver more than 10 years ago, 
ridiculed the state's drunk driving case against Hazelwood. He noted, for 
example, testimony of the 21 witnesses who saw Hazelwood before and after the 
grounding, all of whom said he did not appear to be under the influence of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"For him to have had as much to drink as the state said he did, he would've had 
to crawl back to the ship," Sage scoffed. "He would've been dead." 
</P>
<P>
The key sobriety test, taken 10 hours after the grounding, proved only that the 
captain's blood alcohol level was .061%, slightly above the Coast Guard's 
permissible level but well below the state's .10% minimum standard. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors brought in an Oklahoma toxicologist who used a complicated, and 
scientifically controversial, formula to estimate that Hazelwood was legally 
drunk when he sailed from Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that Hazelwood, alone in his cabin and believing that his 
career had just ended on Bligh Reef, drank after the accident and skewed the 
test results. No evidence of that was presented during the trial, however, and 
Hazelwood did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
Sage also said the panel concluded that Hazelwood's orders before and after the 
grounding "all were prudent and precise. He was not impaired." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow juror Terrill Smith said the panel was leaning to acquittal from the 
very first ballot, although it took some time to reach unanimous agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The incident that provoked the most discussion, the two jurors said, was 
Hazelwood's absence from the bridge, leaving his third mate responsible for 
steering around ice floes. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Brent Cole had argued that was an example of criminal recklessness. 
The jury agreed with the defense, which noted that Hazelwood had given the 
correct course instructions and was not behaving differently than other 
captains in similar situations. 
</P>
<P>
Both jurors also criticized the Coast Guard, which operates a $70-million 
vessel traffic center in Valdez. Coast Guard radar operators had failed to 
alert the Exxon Valdez that it was heading for the rocks of Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
"They obviously weren't doing their jobs," Sage said of the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the issue of who is to blame for the disastrous effects of the spill 
remains unresolved, at least to some extent. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers had complained since the outset that Hazelwood was being held 
responsible not only for the grounding - which they conceded was "a tragic 
accident" - but also for the "botched containment and cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people shared the blame for what happened, but all sides were trying 
to sink captain Hazelwood. The state of Alaska, the Coast Guard, the federal 
government, they all wanted him to be their scapegoat," said Tom Russo, another 
defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps now people will look beyond the captain." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups quickly reacted to the verdict by agreeing with the 
defense characterization of Hazelwood as a scapegoat. "Exxon, not one of its 
employees, should have been tried," said Robert H. Sulnick, executive director 
of Santa Monica-based American Oceans Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Manheim, spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, 
D.C., said "we think Mr. Hazelwood has been to some extent set up by that 
corporation as a scapegoat and that Exxon is the real culprit in this 
disaster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Atty. Gen. Douglas Baily said at a news conference in Juneau that he was 
pleased with the verdict and had congratulated the prosecutors on the single 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
He said the prosecution had proceeded against Hazelwood "certainly not as a 
scapegoat, but as a result of his own involvement as we saw it. It was always 
my view that the captain of that vessel is ultimately responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Former Valdez Mayor John Devins said Hazelwood was never the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue confronting the state of Alaska is whether industry is prepared 
to prevent another oil spill," said Devins, now a candidate for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's legal battles began within a few days of the grounding. He was 
still in Valdez when the Coast Guard served a summons notifying the captain 
that his license would be reviewed. Exxon immediately fired the skipper. 
</P>
<P>
Relieved of command and a job, and with his personal security in some doubt, 
the grounded captain drove to Anchorage and flew home to Huntington, Long 
Island, apparently unaware that local law enforcement officials were preparing 
a criminal action against him. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few days, Hazelwood would become the object of a highly publicized 
manhunt launched by embarrassed Alaskan officials who didn't know he had left 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, however, accompanied by his attorneys, Hazelwood surrendered 
to a court near his Long Island home. Amid a circus of reporters and TV 
cameras, a Suffolk County judge accused Hazelwood of complicity in an 
environmental disaster comparable to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was set at $1 million. Hazelwood spent a night in the county jail before 
an appeals court reduced it to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last May a grand jury in Alaska added the most serious charge - a felony count 
of criminal mischief that carried a potential penalty of five years in prison 
- setting the stage for the trial that began Feb. 5.

VALDEZ, Alaska 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker Exxon Valdez on 
Wednesday as the former captain of the vessel surrendered to authorities in New 
York to face criminal charges in the massive oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Hazelwood, 42, surrendered to police in a Long Island suburb of New York 
City and hours later Judge Kenneth Rohl set bail at $500,000 - 10 times what 
Alaskan authorities had sought. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood's lawyer said he had not decided whether to waive extradition 
proceedings and return to Alaska to face the charges; Hazelwood was not 
required to enter a plea Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fired by Exxon 
</P>
<P>
After the Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24, Hazelwood was found to be 
legally drunk and was fired by Exxon. Hazelwood left Alaska before local 
authorities could interview him, and had been pursued since Saturday on a 
fugitive warrant on three misdemeanor charges: operating a watercraft while 
intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Together, those three charges have a maximum penalty of 27 months in prison and 
a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
"These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been equaled, at 
least in this country," Rohl said. "We have a man-made destruction that has not 
been equaled, probably, since Hiroshima." 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials in Washington say they also are investigating whether Hazelwood 
could be charged with felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits 
negligent discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. 
</P>
<P>
No people have been killed or even seriously injured by the spill, but oil has 
seriously disrupted the rich Prince William Sound fishing industry. Also, 
animal-rescue teams estimate the spill has killed several thousand birds and 
hundreds of sea otters. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of wildlife deaths are not easy to make because oiled birds are hard 
to spot from the air, and many beaches are difficult to reach for in person 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
In the wildlife-rich sound, cleanup crews continued to skim emulsified oil as 
thick as pudding. As of Wednesday, 12 days after the Exxon Valdez ran aground, 
the 240,000-barrel slick was estimated to affect an area the size of Delaware, 
and Exxon's fleet of oil-skimming boats had picked up only about 5% of the 
spilled oil. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Alaska condemned Exxon's cleanup on Wednesday and asked the Coast 
Guard to take over the effort. Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), a senior member 
of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee added during a tour of 
Prince William Sound that fraud "is not too strong a word to describe Exxon's 
cleanup claims." 
</P>
<P>
"What they are really doing is managing the failure," Miller said after meeting 
with Aleut Indian residents in the tiny fishing village of Chenega Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said the Coast Guard should be better able to handle 
coordination and management of the cleanup than Exxon, which he said was too 
bureaucratic. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that's been the problem all along. You need a military system to get 
things done," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cowper said he did not want to be "extremely critical" of Exxon, a 
letter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmental official said Exxon had 
been unresponsive. 
</P>
<P>
"Exxon has failed to provide . . . the information necessary to make sound 
planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil and the protection of 
resources," wrote Lynn Kent, chief of the state Oil and Hazardous Substance 
Spill Response Section. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level officials to Valdez and 
determined that federal management of the cleanup was not necessary. Rear Adm. 
Edward Nelson Jr., commander of the Coast Guard's 17th District in Juneau had 
no immediate reply to Cowper's request. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company disagreed with charges it was 
not handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxon was the best organization 
to manage the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup. We think the most 
effective and efficient way to carry out this project is (for Exxon) to 
continue," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker refloat went unexpectedly well. The 987-foot ship lifted off the 
reef three hours earlier than the Exxon salvage crew predicted, proceeding 
without problem under close watch of a flotilla of six tugs and other support 
craft, including the Coast Guard Cutter Rush, to a cove on uninhabited Naked 
Island 25 miles to the southwest, where repairs will be made. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a relatively well-known salvage technique was used to float the 
Valdez - using compressed air to force water out of the ruptured hold and thus 
assist high tide in lifting the vessel off the rocks - "we couldn't predict 
this by the exact hour or minute," said salvage coordinator Gary Gorski, who 
supervised from the ferry Glacier Queen II. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 1 million barrels of oil were pumped from the Exxon Valdez to three 
smaller tankers over the last 11 days, and the salvage process began as soon as 
the last of the tankers left for Southern California refineries on Tuesday. The 
ship was made airtight above the water line, and then, on Wednesday, compressed 
air was forced inside. 
</P>
<P>
The air forced out some of the 998,000 barrels of sea water that had been 
pumped into the stricken tanker as oil was removed. 
</P>
<P>
Naval architect Richard Smith, hired by Exxon, estimated before the refloat 
that the pressure would force enough water out of the hull to lift the ship at 
least three feet. He added that this technique also would produce a pressurized 
buffer of clean sea water between the oil left in the tanker - about 15,000 to 
20,000 barrels - and the once-pristine waters off Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Exxon officials warned in advance that refloating the ship could 
uncover additional oil that had been pinned in pockets between the ship's hull 
and rocky Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
The Port of Valdez was closed at 10 a.m. to clear the iceberg-dotted waters of 
other vessels as the refloating was attempted and Coast Guard spokesman Bruce 
Pimental said that the vital oil terminal would remain closed until the 
stricken tanker was safely anchored. 
</P>
<P>
However, flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to its normal daily flow of 
2.1 million barrels Wednesday, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said. Oil flow 
from the North Slope had been cut by 60% because the spill restricted tanker 
traffic in Valdez harbor, but traffic has increased. 
</P>
<P>
Gorski said that the ease with which the refloat was accomplished may indicate 
that the damage, while severe, may not be as bad as earlier feared. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials were reluctant to estimate how long temporary repairs would 
take or discuss where the tanker would be taken to permanently patch its hull 
and rebuild its internal pumping system, which also was compromised in the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Portland, Ore., was the company's first choice, but it backed away from that 
option after Oregon Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt and managers of the Port of 
Portland expressed concern that the Exxon Valdez would still be leaking oil 
when it arrived there. 
</P>
<P>
Already under attack by Gov. Cowper for fouling Prince William Sound, Exxon 
said it would consider having the tanker repaired in the Far East - Japan, 
Korea or Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Even as it made that concession, the company denied its ship would endanger any 
port it visited for repair.
