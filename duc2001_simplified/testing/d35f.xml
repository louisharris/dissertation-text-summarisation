Heavy Smokers Show Significantly Higher Leukemia Death Rate
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent
higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among
non-smokers, according to a study published Friday.
</P>
<P>
While no direct link has been established between smoking and
leukemia, research published in the British Medical Journal showed
that the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10
cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day it was 57 percent, and
for smokers of 21 or more cigarettes 63 percent, the study showed.
``If the findings in our study represented a direct relationship
between smoking and leukemia, then it must follow that smoking is
responsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hitherto
established causes combined,'' said Dr. Leo Kinlen, director of the
Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
Kinlen conducted the study of 248,000 U.S. military veterans
with E. Rogot, a statistician at the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
They wrote that it was ``the largest study of leukemia and
smoking habits to date (and) represents additional evidence that
leukemia is a smoking-related disease.''
In an editorial in the prestigious weekly, Professor Nicholas
Wald of St. Bartholemew's Hospital in London cautioned that no
cause-and-effect relationship had been established.
</P>
<P>
But he added: ``Whatever the mechanism, the balance of evidence
suggests that smoking may cause leukemia.''
It should therefore be added to the World Heath Organization's
list of tobacco-related causes of death, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted on data collected from 248,000 veterans
between 1954 and 1969, the researchers wrote. During that period
723 died of leukemia. Of these 330 were cigarette smokers, 185 were
ex-smokers, 46 smoked cigars or and 162 were non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
The study found that in some types of leukemia, the death rate
among smokers was sharply higher than the average.
</P>
<P>
Thus for monocytic and myeloid leukemias, the rate among smokers
of more than 20 cigarettes a day was 93 percent higher, compared
with 48 percent for lymphatic leukemias.
</P>
<P>
For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death from
lymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher, and for one to 10
cigarettes, 40 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
When the data was broken down into smokers and ex-smokers, it
suggested that ex-smokers also are significantly more at risk. The
death rate among smokers was 53 percent higher, and among
ex-smokers 39 percent.

Loss of Interferon Genes Linked with Leukemia
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A form of blood cancer that strikes children
appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the
body's ability to make interferon, according to a study published
today.
</P>
<P>
The researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's
production of interferon, a disease-fighting substance, may play a
role in warding off the development of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as
regulators that stop the body's cells from becoming cancerous.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, based at the University of Chicago, found an
association between loss of the genes and development of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood leukemia.
</P>
<P>
They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found
that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes.
</P>
<P>
Their work, directed by Dr. Manuel O. Diaz, was published in the
New England Journal of Medicine. It adds to the growing list of
cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of
particular genes.
</P>
<P>
Some genes, known oncogenes, are though to trigger cancer.
</P>
<P>
Cancer can also occur when other genes, known as anti-oncogenes,
are missing.
</P>
<P>
Interferon plays a variety of roles in regulating the body's
immune defenses and controlling cell growth.
</P>
<P>
The production of two forms of interferon, known as alpha and
beta-1, are controlled by two genes that are close together on
chromosome 9 in the body's library of genes.
</P>
<P>
In the latest work, the researchers found that this section of
the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. However, they left open the possibility
that some other gene in this region besides those that make
interferon could also be the tumor-suppressing gene.
</P>
<P>
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts for about one-quarter of
all childhood cancers. It strikes one in every 30,000 children.

New Drug Effective Against Rare Form of Leukemia
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An experimental cancer drug that works after a
single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine
yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study.
</P>
<P>
The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA _ has
produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia
patients treated, and none has relapsed so far.
</P>
<P>
Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it
``may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell
leukemia.''
The drug also has been used successfully against chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. It, like hairy cell leukemia, is a cancer of
the white blood cells, which produce disease-fighting antibodies.
</P>
<P>
The latest study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, was directed by Dr. Lawrence D. Piro of the Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif. Scripps recently
made an agreement with Johnson 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceuticals to
produce and distribute the drug once it's approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
In the published work, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients as
far back as four years ago. In 11, the disease disappeared and they
remain disease free.
</P>
<P>
In all, the Scripps doctors have treated 24 patients with almost
complete success. However, they caution that longer follow up will
be necessary before they can be sure they have actually cured the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed
in recent years. They are interferon and deoxycoformycin, a drug
that is similar to 2-CdA. However, interferon is less effective,
and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the only unwanted effect of 2-CdA was a few days of
fever. Patients experienced no nausea, hair loss, rashes or other
symptoms typical of cancer therapy. Also unlike other treatments,
this one appears to work after a single seven-day course of therapy.

<P>
A single round of treatment with an experimental
new medicine appears to be highly effective against a rare form of
leukemia and may help fight other kinds of blood cancer as well,
says a study published today.
</P>
<P>
The new drug was developed at Scripps Clinic and Research
Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., where doctors tested it on patients
with hairy cell leukemia. In almost every case, the medicine erased
all signs of the disease.
</P>

Hairy cell leukemia affects the white blood cells that make
disease-fighting antibodies. Doctors are also testing the drug
against chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and
cutaneous T cell lymphoma.

 Smokers Are More Apt Than Nonsmokers To Die From Leukemia, Study Concludes 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE> LONDON  
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men who smoke heavily are nearly twice as likely as nonsmokers to die from a common form of leukemia, concludes a report by the University of Edinburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis, based on a previous study of 248,046 U.S. veterans, offers the firmest link yet between cigarette consumption and the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The finding could add leukemia to the already lengthy list of suspected health risks from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
The report in tomorrow's British Medical Journal "may well have an emotional impact on some people who are vacillating" about quitting smoking "and for one reason or another have a fear of leukemia," suggested Nicholas Wald, an epidemiologist at the Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital here. 
</P>
<P>
"The balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia," Dr. Wald wrote in an accompanying commentary on the analysis, which was conducted by University of Edinburgh epidemiologist Leo Kinlen. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kinlen, who directs the university's Cancer Epidemiology Unit, examined leukemia deaths from a U.S. study that had tracked veterans' smoking between 1954 and 1969. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier study tallied overall deaths from various causes, including 723 deaths due to leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kinlen found veterans who had smoked more than 21 cigarettes a day were the most likely to die from myeloid leukemia, the most common form of the disease in middle-aged people. 
</P>
<P>
These heavy smokers had a 93% greater chance of developing fatal leukemia than the veterans who never had smoked. 
</P>
<P>
For those smoking between 10 and 20 cigarettes a day, the increased risk was 75%. 
</P>
<P>
And men using fewer than 10 cigarettes daily were 31% more likely to die from leukemia than nonsmokers, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Previous studies have observed higher death rates from leukemia among smokers, but either involved fewer patients or didn't compare amounts smoked with incidence of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, leukemia "has in general not been regarded as a a malignancy related to smoking," Dr. Kinlen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The latest analysis doesn't prove a causal link, Dr. Kinlen noted in a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
But "it is the best evidence to date that the relationship is genuine." 
If the link is causal, an editorial in the medical journal said, "then smoking is a more important cause of leukemia in adults than all other known causes combined." 
Current known causes include radiation and exposure to the chemical benzene. 
</P>
<P>
Leukemia is fairly rare. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 18,100 Americans will die from it this year, making the disease the fifth-greatest cause of cancer deaths. 
</P>
<P>
But leukemia represents the third-leading cause of death in U.S. children, behind accidents and birth defects, according to the American Cancer Society.

   New Drug Shows
   Promise Treating
   Type of Leukemia

<P>
A new cancer drug proved strikingly successful with very
few side effects in treating a relatively rare form of
leukemia, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The drug, called 2-CdA, was nearly 100% effective treating
12 patients with hairy-cell leukemia. The patients underwent
just one seven-day treatment and experienced almost none of
the debilitating side effects such as vomiting, hair-loss and
kidney and liver problems associated with other chemotherapy.
The results need to be replicated by other researchers
before definitive conclusions can be made, and the long-term
effect of the treatment remains unknown. But the initial
experience with the compound is especially promising, and an
apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease,
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
"There aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one
course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay
away for as long as four years," says Lawrence Piro, chief of
cancer research at Scripps Clinic 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Research Foundation, La
Jolla, Calif., where the drug was developed. "The leukemia
hasn't come back in any of the patients we treated." The
study is published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
"It is without doubt the most effective treatment for
hairy-cell leukemia, in terms of rapidity of response," adds
Elihu H. Estey, a cancer researcher at the University of
Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. Dr. Estey
recently began treating patients with 2-CdA and has had
similar results with five patients. "It's a striking
finding," he says. "It's very unlikely to be a fluke."
Hairy-cell leukemia, so-called because of the appearance
of the cancerous cells under the microscope, affects about
6,000 people in the U.S., with 600 new cases a year. As the
disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to
infection and often need blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
Until the mid-1980s, treatments were ineffective, and
patients often died of blood problems and infections. Since
then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.
and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called
deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from
hairy-cell leukemia. Hoffmann-La Roche is the U.S. subsidiary
of F. Hoffmann-La Roche 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co. of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
But neither drug is as effective as 2-CdA appears to be in
low doses and both can cause such side effects as nausea,
vomiting, skin rashes and nervous-system disorders,
researchers say. "With the lack of toxicity and the ease with
which people go into remission {with 2-CdA}, I think there's
something really going on here," says Ellin Berman, a staff
leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,
New York.
</P>
<P>
Scripps said it negotiated an agreement with a subsidiary
of Johnson 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., to produce and
distribute 2-CdA to other centers for broader clinical
trials. The researchers said the drug is easy to produce and
thus is likely to be less expensive than other cancer
treatments.
</P>
<P>
In the 12-patient study, 2-CdA, short for
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, was administered continuously for
seven days to patients aged 36 to 61. Within eight to 10
weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their
blood or bone marrow; the 12th had a small amount remaining
in the marrow, but he declined further bone marrow
monitoring, Dr. Piro said. His blood tests are normal, Dr.
</P>
<P>
Piro added. None of the patients have had a relapse; complete
remission has lasted from seven to 46 months after treatment,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
"When you can make all the disease go away with a single
infusion of therapy, you have a disease which may be able to
be cured," Dr. Piro said. But because hairy-cell leukemia
proliferates slowly, a relapse could occur long after
treatment. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether
2-CdA actually cures the disease.
</P>
<P>
The drug was first made about 10 years ago at Scripps by
Dennis A. Carson, who studied severe combined
immunodeficiency disease, made famous a few years ago by the
Texas boy that lived in a bubble. People with that disease
lack an enzyme that processes deoxyadenosine, a chemical
that, without the enzyme, builds up in infection-fighting
white blood cells and kills them. Since cancer patients have
the enzyme, Scripps scientists developed a compound that
mimics deoxyadenosine, but tricks the enzyme so it can't be
processed. The compound then kills the white blood cells,
including those that are cancerous. New, normal white cells
are then generated in the bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
Because hairy-cell leukemia is rare, a 12-patient study
"is considered a pretty good series," says Sloan-Kettering's
Dr. Berman. "It's ironic that we have three active drugs for
a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common
forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments."
Dr. Piro said 2-CdA has also been used effectively in
initial trials to treat more common cancers, including
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. About 50% to 60% of patients -
most of whom had failed other treatments - responded to the
drug, some with complete remission, he said. "Now, we will
use {2-CdA} as a first treatment to see if response and
remission are higher," he said. Meanwhile, researchers at
University of California at San Francisco are testing 2-CdA
on AIDS-related lymphoma.

   Acne Drug's Success Against Leukemia
   May Lead to New Way to Treat Cancer
   -

<P>
NEW YORK - Preliminary success with a variation of an
acne drug to treat an adult leukemia may have opened a new
avenue to attack cancer, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Although it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness
of the treatment, 16 of 20 patients treated up to nine months
ago have been in remission of their blood cancer, researchers
from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center here reported.
Because of the way the acne drug is thought to work, the
results support a new concept of cancer chemotherapy. In the
type of leukemia suffered by the patients, white blood cells
have turned malignant at an immature stage of cell
development. Their arrested development is what renders them
practically immortal and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The acne drug is believed to trigger these immature but
malignant cells to divide and mature and then die essentially
a natural death. This new concept of triggering cancer cells
to mature and die contrasts with the conventional concept of
chemotherapy, in which drugs simply poison malignant cells.
</P>
<P>
The drug used in the experimental treatment is known as
tretinoin, which belongs to a class of chemicals called
retinoic acids that are related to vitamin A. Tretinoin is
sold in ointment form as Retin-A, the acne medication
produced by Johnson 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceutical
division. The tretinoin used in the leukemia patients,
however, is a pill that was prepared for the experiment by
chemists at Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., the U.S. arm of Roche
Holding Ltd. of Switzerland. Roche, which has a long history
of making retinoic acids, sells one of its acids as Accutane,
a pill for treating severe acne.
</P>
<P>
The particular form of leukemia that appears to respond
readily to the acne-drug type of treatment is called acute
promyelocytic leukemia. It is an uncommon cancer, afflicting
about 1,000 Americans a year, in which certain cells in the
bone marrow become malignant before they have matured into
fully functioning white blood cells. The malignant, immature
white cells (known as myelocytes) flood the blood stream,
producing fatigue, fever, weight loss and bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Until now, chemotherapy with standard anti-cancer drugs
has been the only effective treatment for acute
promyelocyltic leukemia, but it produces cures in only about
a third of patients.
</P>
<P>
The tip-off that an tretinoin-like drug might be effective
in treating the leukemia came from a genetic finding, Dr.
</P>
<P>
Raymond P. Warrell Jr. of Memorial Sloan-Kettering and his
colleagues in New York and at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston reported in this week's New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Most patients with promyleocytic leukemia apparently have
the same defect in two of their 23 chromosomes, the
structures in the cell that contain all the genes. A piece of
chromosome number 17 appears to have broken loose and become
a part of chromosome number 15.
</P>
<P>
Last year, molecular geneticists identified one of the
genes in chromosome 17 that was damaged when the chunk of the
chromosome broke loose. The damaged gene, it turned out,
ordinarily made a protein - a receptor - that grabbed hold
of retinoic acid. This and other laboratory findings
suggested that the immaturity of the leukemic white blood
cells might somehow be related to a foul-up in the way the
cells handled or failed to handle retinoic acid.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the genetic damage also hinted that doses of
retinoic acids might prod the immature malignant cells to
proceed to maturity and then die as normal white blood cells
do.
</P>
<P>
"We're now the third group to show remissions {with
tretinoin} in this leukemia," following Chinese and French
researchers, Dr. Warrell said. But, he added, the U.S. group
is the first to show that the drug works by triggering the
immature cancer cells to mature, or to "differentiate," in
the biologists jargon. "We've documented conclusively that
differentiation as a method of cancer therapy in humans is a
reality," he said.
