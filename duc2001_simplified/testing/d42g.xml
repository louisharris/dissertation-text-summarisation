Yeltsin Gets Boost in Campaign for Russian President
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The candidate backed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev for
president of the Russian republic withdrew from the race today,
strengthening the campaign of Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist who
has repeatedly clashed with Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
The state news agency Tass reported the withrawal of Russian
Premier Aleksandr V. Vlasov but did not give a reason. It said
Vlasov's pullout had been announced at the Congress of the Russian
Federation, which will elect the president, a newly created post in
the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Gorbachev attacked Yeltsin's platform, accusing
him of calling for the ``breakup of the Soviet Union.''
The Russian republic contains Moscow and encompasses 11 time
zones, from the Baltic to the Pacific. The Russian language
predominates in the Soviet Union, and much of the nation's wealth,
including vast natural resources, is concentrated in the republic.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Yeltsin, two other men remained in the race _
Ivan Polozkov and Vladimir Morokin _ but from the start the
campaign had appeared to be a contest between Yeltsin and Vlasov. A
vote was possible later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Vlasov's announcement, Yeltsin delivered a
well-received speech pledging that if elected, he would defend the
republic from meddling by the national Soviet government, but
refrain from clashing with Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev holds the posts of president of the Soviet Union and
general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, the two most
powerful jobs in the Soviet Union.
``I am for businesslike relations, dialogue and negotiations
with the president and the government, but on the principle that
Russia's sovereignty is not damaged,'' Yeltsin told the Russian
Congress.
</P>
<P>
His bass voice booming through the hall of the Great Kremlin
Palace, Yeltsin pressed a radical platform for bringing the Russian
republic ``out of crisis.''
He presented a point-by-point program on how he would fight for
Russian's sovereignty, unleash market forces, increase housing and
flood stores with consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
He blasted the government program for a transition to a market
economy presented by Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov on Thursday, saying it
had ``already created panic in the stores today.''
Instead, he backed an alternative program involving sale of
government property, more liberal laws on ownership and foreign
loans to make the transition without ``everything falling on the
shoulders of the people.''
Yeltsin already is a member of the Congress of People's
Deputies, which is the national parliament; the Russian Congress of
People's Deputies, the Russian republic's parliament; and the
Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer session, he was asked several times
about his relations with Gorbachev, who entered the hall halfway
through the speech. Yeltsin, formerly Gorbachev's protege, has
become an opponent in the last two years, blaming the Soviet
president for ``halfway reforms.''
But Yeltsin said their personal relationship would not influence
their interaction as presidents. ``If there was or is something
personal, I'll set it aside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin left the podium to prolonged applause, and was followed
by Ivan Polozkov, a Communist Party chief from Krasnodar who is now
considered Yeltsin's main rival.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, with just more
than half the country's population and two-thirds of its territory.

<P>
Russian lawmakers cast ballots Friday night in a
vote to determine whether populist Boris N. Yeltsin would become
president of the Soviet Union's largest republic.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, a onetime Gorbachev ally ousted two years ago as Moscow
Communist Party chief after calling for faster reform, gained a
double boost Friday. Russian deputies and Soviet media praised a
key campaign speech he made, and the candidate backed by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev withdrew.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin, 59, needs backing from 531 of the 1,059 members of
the Russian Congress, more than he himself has estimated he could
count on. Official results from voting late Friday are expected by
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The candidate backed by Gorbachev, Russian premier Alexander
Vlasov, withdrew from the race after it became clear he lacked
Yeltsin's popularity.
</P>
<P>
Vlasov's departure left Ivan Polozkov, a Communist Party chief
from the southern Russia city of Krasnodar, as Yeltsin's main
rival. The third remaining candidate, aviation instructor Vladimir
Morokin, did not appear to have any chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
Russia, by far the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics,
comprises more than two-thirds of the country's territory. It is
home to half the Soviet populace.
</P>
<P>
A Yeltsin victory would mean an important setback for Gorbachev,
who has clashed repeatedly with his former protege. Gorbachev spoke
out Wednesday against Yeltsin's plan for increased Russian
autonomy, claiming it would mean ``the breakup of the Soviet
Union.''
Yeltsin, however, pledged Friday that if elected, he would
defend the republic from Moscow interference while not letting
personal conflicts interfere with his Kremlin dealings.
``I am for business-like relations, dialogue and negotiations
with the president and the government, but on the principle that
Russia's sovereignty is not damaged,'' Yeltsin told the Russian
Congress. The Russians use the term ``sovereignty'' to mean
increased autonomy _ not secession.
</P>
<P>
With his bass voice booming through the hall of the Great
Kremlin Palace, Yeltsin pressed a point-by-point program on
promoting for Russian sovereignty, unleashing market forces,
increasing housing and flooding stores with consumer goods.
``Vremya,'' the nightly news program on state-run Soviet
television, gave Yeltsin high marks for his platform. ``Having
heard all the contenders, I can say his program for the rebirth of
Russia came off the best-argued and thought-through,'' the Vremya
report said.
``The people believe in Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin,'' deputy
Nina Sivova told the Congress. ``His great force of will is needed
today.''
In an early indication of Yeltsin's plans if he wins, his speech
blasted the government program announced Thursday for a transition
to a free market economy. He said it had ``already created panic in
the stores today.''
Instead, he backed an alternative program involving sale of
government property, full independence for enterprises, more
liberal laws on ownership and foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is already a member of the national Congress of People's
Deputies and a member of the Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He has made a remarkable political comeback from disgrace two
years ago, when he was ousted from his post as Moscow party chief
and ostracized by the Kremlin elite, including Gorbachev. Yeltsin
has continued to level public blasts of criticism at Gorbachev for
his ``halfway reforms.''
If no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first
round, the election goes into a runoff between the top two
vote-getters.

Yeltsin Elected President Of Russia
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin triumphed over
opposition from Mikhail S. Gorbachev to win the presidency of the
largest Soviet republic today in what he called ``Russia's social,
economic and spiritual rebirth.''
After three hard-fought ballots in the 1,060-member Russian
Congress of People's Deputies, Yeltsin won 535, four more than the
majority he needed. Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov, received 467
ballots.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin now poses a substantial challenge to Gorbachev, who
retains the two most powerful jobs in the country: president of the
Soviet Union and general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
However, Gennadi Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign
Ministry, said Yeltsin's election could strengthen Gorbachev's
campaign for economic reforms.
``Yeltsin's victory is an expression of general discontent with
how things are going in the Soviet Union's biggest republic,''
Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York.
``The Soviet Union is a democracy, so we accept what the Russian
parliament has decided. It may be a blessing in disguise. President
Gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the right, and
possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the
left,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Igor Malashenko, foreign policy advisor to the Communist Party
who accompanied Gerasimov at the news conference, agreed.
``This victory of Yeltsin has been misinterpreted as a problem
for Gorbachev,'' Malashenko said. ``Yeltsin is also a reformer,
although he reflects concepts which are different from Gorbachev.
``In this respect I believe it (the election) can strengthen the
cause of reform in the Soviet Union. Today, many people blame
Gorbachev for problems and now they have another person to blame.''
After the election result was announced in the Grand Kremlin
Palace, the burly 59-year-old Yeltsin, strode to the podium,
received warm applause and cheers from fellow lawmakers, and was
handed a bouquet of flowers.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he felt ``a certain satisfaction, but at the same
time, I have much more a feeling of responsibility at this turning
point for Russia and the country.''
``I pledge not to spare anything _ health or time _ to do
everything to get out of this crisis and lead Russia to better
times,'' Yeltsin said in his victory speech.
</P>
<P>
He called the day ``the beginning of the road to Russia's
social, economic and spiritual rebirth, the way out of the crisis
and toward the blossoming of Russia as a sovereign, independent
government in the framework of our union.''
Gorbachev actively opposed Yeltsin's election, telling the
Russian Congress last week that his platform of moving political
and economic power from central to local authorities would lead to
a ``breakup of the union.''
The Russian Federation is by far the largest of the 15 Soviet
republics, stretching from the Baltic Sea in the west to the
Pacific Ocean in the east. It is home to one-half the country's 285
million people and includes Moscow.
</P>
<P>
As the president of Russia, Yeltsin will have a highly visible
platform from which to wage his campaign for more radical reforms
than those pursued so far by Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
The victory marks an amazing comeback for Yeltsin. Less than
three years ago, he was reviled in the Soviet press, attacked by
party officials, rebuffed by his former mentor, Gorbachev, and
considered finished politically. Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin to
Moscow to head the city's Communist Party, but he was fired in 1987
after showing little reverance for party hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, however, made his rift with Gorbachev work for him.
</P>
<P>
The popular and outspoken Yeltsin had lost the second round of
voting on Saturday by just 28 votes. He lost the first round Friday
with 497 ballots to 473 for Krasnodar regional Communist Party
chief Ivan Polozkov.
</P>
<P>
He was nominated again Monday and faced Vlasov, who had
Gorbachev's support, and Valentin Tsoy, a little-known businessman
from the Soviet Far East, who received 11 votes.
</P>
<P>
After his election, Yeltsin walked through the Kremlin grounds
with reporters and well-wishers. After passing through the Spassky
Gate, he was joined by more supporters.
``Thank you! Thank you for our future!'' one man shouted.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin mounted the steps of an embankment below the Kremlin wall
for an impromptu speech to supporters who rushed across the
cobblestone street. To shouts of ``victory!'' Yeltsin pledged to
work for a ``renewed Russia.'' The crowd pledged support.
``We're prepared to go together with him into tough times.
</P>
<P>
Everyone says that,'' one crowd member, Nadezda Matveyeva said.
</P>
<P>
During his campaign, Yeltsin called on the Congress to reject
the Kremlin's new program for gradually transforming the country's
crippled, centrally planned economy to a partial market economy.
``The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under its
defense,'' he said. The reform program, which would triple the
price of bread on July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs
starting Jan. 1, caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city
authorities to bar sales to non-residents of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who left Moscow today for a Washington summit, went
on national television Sunday night to try to calm fears. But
anxiety is high and the list of items being rationed is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has broadly outlined a plan that would more rapidly seek
a transition to a market-based economy, giving more freedom to
enterprises and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said Monday they believed Yeltsin's offer of a
coalition government in the republic bolstered his chances to win
today's round.
</P>
<P>
Discontent over the government's economic program also boosted
Yeltsin's campaign, said one of his backers, lawmaker Leonid
Gurevich of Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people
could lose their jobs as a result of the central government's
reforms, expected to drive many inefficient businesses into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-step reform plan, to be implemented through
1995, 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public
sector, and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices.

Populist reformer Boris N. Yeltsin won the
presidency of the largest Soviet republic Tuesday, overcoming
opposition by Mikhail S. Gorbachev and declaring the start of
``Russia's social, economic and spiritual rebirth.''
Yeltsin's election, after three hard-fought ballots in the
Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation, poses a
substantial challenge to Gorbachev and may spur more radical
reforms across the country.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who arrives Wednesday in Washington for a summit,
retains the two most powerful jobs in the country: president of the
Soviet Union and General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
But as president of the largest of 15 Soviet republics, Yeltsin
will have a highly visible platform from which to wage his campaign
for more radical reforms. Yeltsin and other Soviet officials said
they believe his election will help Gorbachev push more radical
reforms.
``It may be a blessing in disguise,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York.
``Gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the right, and
possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the
left.''
Yeltsin said: ``At first, President Gorbachev will react very
unhappily, but then he'll gradually get used to this
inevitability.''
The strapping, white-haired Yeltsin told reporters that he would
seek reconciliation with Gorbachev and avoid confrontation with
him, so long as it did not hurt Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's
Communist Party, but the two men had a falling out in 1987 after
Yeltsin publicly criticized the pace of Kremlin reforms. They have
been at odds since then.
</P>
<P>
After the vote result was announced in the Grand Kremlin Palace,
Yeltsin strode to the podium to warm applause and pledged to
``spare nothing _ health or time _ to get out of this crisis and
lead Russia to better times.''
His bass voice echoing through the hall, he called the day ``the
beginning of the road to Russia's social, economic and spiritual
rebirth, the way out of the crisis and toward the blossoming of
Russia as a sovereign, independent government in the framework of
our union.''
He left through the Kremlin gates later to the tumultuous cheers
of a small crowd of well-wishers chanting ``Victory! Victory!'' One
man yelled, ``Thank you, thank you for the future!''
Gorbachev strongly opposed Yeltsin's election. He told the
Russian Congress last week that Yeltsin's platform of moving
political and economic power from central to local authorities
would lead to a ``breakup of the union.''
The Russian Federation stretches from the Baltic Sea in the west
to the Pacific Ocean in the East. It is home to half the country's
285 million people and includes Moscow, the Soviet capital.
</P>
<P>
As president of the Russian Congress, a newly created body that
holds the Russian Federation's highest government authority,
Yeltsin acts as chief executive of the republic and took office
immediately. As the first president of a newly reorganized
legislature, he will play a major role in shaping his powers and
duties, which as yet are unclear.
</P>
<P>
After three votes in the 1,060-member Russian Congress, Yeltsin
won 535 votes, four more than the majority needed.
</P>
<P>
Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov received 467 votes. Valentin
Tsoy, a little-known businessman from the Soviet Far East, received
11 votes.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said Tuesday they believed Yeltsin gained the last few
votes he needed by offering to form a coalition government with
members of the conservative Communist Party bloc and other groups.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he believed he gained several votes because of a
last-minute push by Gorbachev to block his election. Gorbachev
reportedly urged delegates at a meeting Monday night not to vote
for Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Alexander Liubimov, a well-known TV commentator,
said Yeltsin's election would force Gorbachev to start dealing with
another strong leader instead of ``shadows'' willing to defer to
him. ``It will be a lesson for him. Maybe a hard one,'' Liubimov
said.
</P>
<P>
Vitaly Churkin, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Eduard A.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, said on NBC that Yeltsin's election ``might actually
help Gorbachev because Gorbachev is for radical reform, and he
needs more popular support for that.''
Some also said Yeltsin may have benefited from the adverse
reaction to the Kremlin's proposed program for making the crippled
Soviet economy a partial market economy.
</P>
<P>
The reform program, which would triple the price of bread on
July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs starting Jan. 1,
caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city authorities to bar
sales to non-residents of the capital Monday.
</P>
<P>
The national legislature postponed a decision on the reform plan
Tuesday, raising the possibility of compromise with Yeltsin and
others demanding more radical measures. It also rejected a motion
for a no-confidence vote in Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who
presented the reforms last week.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has proposed a more rapid transition to a market-based
economy that would grant more freedom to enterprises and
entrepreneurs.

New Russian President Negotiates Coalition Government
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the newly elected president of
the Russian republic, sat down with 130 legislators today to
negotiate the makeup of a coalition government for the largest
Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Legislators said Yeltsin immediately came under pressure to
retain as Russian prime minister Alexander Vlasov, a member of the
Communist Party Politburo who had been Yeltsin's rival in Tuesday's
balloting for president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin opened today's meeting in a businesslike fashion and set
only one limit, asking that one of his deputies be a woman,
legislators said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, a frequent critic of Soviet President Mikhail S.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his gradual reforms, was reported to have gained the
last few votes he needed by offering to guarantee a place in his
government for other factions.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the Russian legislators are Communist Party
members, they range from radical reformers like Yeltsin to
hard-liners unhappy with even the more modest innovations of
Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin won his new job Tuesday on the third ballot in the
Russian Congress of People's Deputies.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin poses a substantial challenge to Gorbachev, both through
his personal popularity and his demand that much authority be
transferred from Gorbachev's central government to the republics.
</P>
<P>
That would greatly increase his power, since Russia is the
largest republic with 52 percent of the Soviet Union's 289 million
people and three-quarters of its land.
</P>
<P>
The strapping, white-haired Siberian said Tuesday he would seek
reconciliation with Gorbachev and avoid confrontation with him as
long as it would not hurt Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
He took the first step in that direction today, meeting in the
ornate St. George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace with
representatives of each political faction and each ethnic region in
the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin asked for two to three nominations for each ministerial
post in the Russian government. He said the candidates would be
presented to the full Russian Congress for confirmation starting
Thursday. It was not clear how such a system would lead to the
delicate balance of political forces and personalities typical of a
coalition government in the West.
</P>
<P>
The session was closed to reporters after the first few minutes.
</P>
<P>
Legislators said the talks were not aimed at parceling out
portfolios in the Council of Ministers to specific political
parties or factions.
``We don't really have hard political divisions like that right
now,'' explained Igor Bratishev, an economist and deputy from
Rostov-on-Don who participated in today's meeting with 130
legislators arrayed around a vast rectangle under the ornate
vaulted ceiling of St. George's Hall.
</P>
<P>
So far, 24 legislative groups have registered, including
Yeltsin's own Democratic Russia and one called Communists of
Russia. But the majority have a narrow focus, such as ecology,
medical workers and legislators concerned with the problems of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The so-called ``conciliation committee'' is seeking a consensus
on candidates for prime minister and the three assistants to
Yeltsin, said Vladimir Ivanov, a legislator from Buryatia near Lake
Baikal in Siberia.
``People want Yeltsin to suggest Vlasov for prime minister,''
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The committee, representing each political group and each ethnic
region in the Russian Federation, is examining candidates' personal
qualifications and morale convictions, Bratishev said.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, Canada, on Tuesday Gorbachev told reporters he was
``somewhat concerned'' about Yeltsin's victory but encouraged by
the new Russian president's vow to settle divisions in the Congress
and work with the Kremlin leadership.
``If, however, he is playing a political game, then we may be in
for a difficult time,'' Gorbachev said.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who was to arrive in Washington today for a summit
with President Bush, spent days watching the struggle for control
of the Russian Congress. He even took the floor to speak against
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and many Soviets said the election could help advance
reforms in the Soviet Union.
``It may be a blessing in disguise,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in
New York. ``Gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the
right, and possibly it is better to have the election of a critic
from the left.''
Vitaly Churkin, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
Yeltsin's election ``might actually help Gorbachev because
Gorbachev is for radical reform, and he needs more popular support
for that.''
Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist
Party, but the two men fell out over Yeltsin's public criticism in
1987 of the pace of reform and have been at odds ever since.
</P>
<P>
As president of the Russian Congress, a newly created body that
holds the Russian Federation's highest government authority,
Yeltsin acts as chief executive of the republic.
</P>
<P>
As the first president of a newly reorganized legislature, he
will play a major role in shaping his powers and duties, which as
yet are unclear.

Yeltsin Says He'll Put Aside Differences With Gorbachev
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian
Federation and a leading critic of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said
Thursday he will try to make peace in his personal feud with the
Soviet president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, a radical reformer, was quoted by the official Tass news
agency as saying he would put aside personal differences with
Gorbachev when the president returns from the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was seeking to calm the fears of the deputies of the
republic's Congress about his stormy relationship with Gorbachev,
his former mentor.
</P>
<P>
In his new position as president of Russia, the largest Soviet
republic, Yeltsin has a formidable platform from which to challenge
and criticize Gorbachev, who opposed his election.
</P>
<P>
Deputies speaking Thursday at the Russian Congress ``expressed
concern over the exchange of statements about each other'' by
Yeltsin and Gorbachev, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin answered that after Gorbachev returns June 4 from the
summit in Washington, ``I think we'll have an appropriate
conversation, and we'll resolve most issues without damaging the
sovereignty and aims of Russia,'' Tass said.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Wednesday, Yeltsin called for achieving
Russian ``sovereignty'' within 100 days. The term is used here to
mean not independence, but autonomy in most internal decisions.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also urged the Kremlin to allow the other 14 republics to
enjoy the same autonomy, making the country a federation of states
that could overrule the central government on most matters.
</P>
<P>
Although Yeltsin said he wanted a ``businesslike'' relationship
with Gorbachev, he also made an oblique call Thursday for Gorbachev
to give up one of his posts: either Soviet president or Communist
Party general secretary.
``I am against combining any post in one person. And I am talking
not just about the chairmanship of the party at the Russian level,
at the regional level, or at the local level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa on Tuesday, Gorbachev said he was ``somewhat
concerned'' about Yeltsin's victory and feared that if Yeltsin ``is
playing a political game, then we may be in for a difficult time.''
There have been no reports that Gorbachev sent congratulations to
Yeltsin on his election.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist
Party but fired him in 1987 after Yeltsin publicly criticized the
pace of reform. Relations have been strained ever since.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin capped a remarkable political comeback by winning
election Tuesday as Russian president.
</P>
<P>
However, at Thursday's session of the Russian Congress, Deputy
Ivan Galushko from the Jewish autonomous region in the Soviet Far
East said Yeltsin was overstepping his authority with some of his
statements the day before.
</P>
<P>
He called on Yeltsin ``to refrain from hasty statements on
questions that are within the competence of the Congress or Supreme
Soviet.''
Tass said many deputies seconded Galushko's opinion.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Yeltsin acknowledged disagreements with Gorbachev
but said he would put them aside.
``True, we have our differences,'' said Yeltsin. ``I renounce all
these personal aspects fully and completely. I leave that behind.''
A deputy of the national Supreme Soviet legislature, Anatoly
Denisov, said in an interview that the differences between Yeltsin
and Gorbachev are so pronounced they portend ``very bad
consequences'' and ``difficult conflicts'' for the nation.
</P>
<P>
He said they could lead to the imposition of Soviet presidential
rule nationwide.

  NEWSPAPERS ATTACK YELTSIN'S STABILITY
RUSSIAN REPUBLIC ELECTIONEERING GETS MEAN

<P>
As the race for the Russian presidency entered its last days, the campaign
turned dirty, with newspaper allegations that front-runner Boris Yeltsin is
emotionally unstable, that he tried to commit suicide in late 1987 and that he
is still receiving psychological assistance.;    The charges were contained in
an article published in Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, and in a
story published Saturday by Sovietskaya Rossiya, a conservative daily
published by the Russian Communist Party.  
</P>
<P>
Russians vote Wednesday in the first democratic elections for the
presidency of the huge Russian Republic as well as for the mayors of Moscow,
Leningrad and other cities.;    In Moscow on Monday, an estimated 30,000
people marched through the streets in a show of support for Yeltsin, carrying
balloons and photos of their candidate and urging Russians to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
World chess champion Gary Kasparov spoke in Yeltsin's behalf.;    Just before
the first of the negative articles appeared, Yeltsin's aides privately charged
that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev personally had ordered a KGB smear
against Yeltsin. Though Yeltsin's staff would not repeat the allegations
publicly, the cycle of smear and recrimination indicated that the
rapprochement between Yeltsin and Gorbachev is little more than skin deep.;   
It also indicated growing desperation on the part of the Soviet leadership as
it watched Yeltsin build an apparently unassailable lead. If Yeltsin failed to
win an absolute majority, he would be forced into a runoff with his main
opponent, former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov. It is a matter of
debate whether Yeltsin will face a runoff.;    The Pravda article, purporting
to be a psychological study of Yeltsin by four academics, mentioned "a suicide
attempt at a time when his party career was finished." The assertion was used
to buttress a claim that Yeltsin was particularly unstable under stress.;   
"The main feature of Boris Nikolayevich's personality is his excessive need
for power," the professors wrote.;    Throughout his career, Yeltsin has shown
himself to be simplistic, disloyal and, above all, authoritarian, the
professors said, and his striving for power shows "an unconscious striving to
compensate for feelings of inadequacy.";    The suicide story was developed at
greater length in Sovietskaya Rossiya by former dissident Roy Medvedev, now a
conservative member of the Soviet Parliament. Medvedev supports Ryzhkov for
president.;    In a stinging attack on Yeltsin for hypocrisy and opportunism,
Medvedev declared that in late 1987 "Yeltsin even attempted to commit suicide
with a pair of sharp scissors used for cutting paper. This was a serious
nervous breakdown.";    Medvedev alleged that the incident took place soon
after a stormy meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee in October
1987.

  YELTSIN WINNING POWERFUL MANDATE  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boris Yeltsin, the radical populist who campaigned for a bold transformation
of the Soviet economy on the principles of free enterprise, appeared to have
won a solid victory Wednesday as the first elected president of Russia.;   
Preliminary reports from the cities of European Russia, Siberia and the Soviet
Far East showed Yeltsin, 60, winning more than 50 percent of the vote - and
often 70 percent - against his five rivals almost everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Ryzhkov, the former Soviet prime minister, was reported running a
distant second, averaging about 20 percent of the votes cast but doing better
in rural areas where the Communist Party had mobilized support among
farmworkers.;    Although a strong vote for Ryzhkov and perhaps other
conservative candidates in Russia's smaller cities and rural areas could
diminish Yeltsin's margin, he appeared certain of the absolute majority of
more than 50 percent he needed to win the presidency on the first ballot,
avoiding a runoff election.;    The likely size of that victory, moreover,
should not only assure Yeltsin the new executive presidency of the Russian
federation, the largest Soviet republic, but also give him the mandate he
sought for sweeping political and economic changes in the Soviet Union as a
whole.;    A beaming Yeltsin was greeted by chants of "Victory! Victory!" from
scores of supporters as he voted in Moscow. After dropping his ballot in a
box, he raised his fist and clasped his hands above his head in triumph.;   
"This is a celebration of the Russian federation's sovereignty," said Yeltsin,
noting that Wednesday was a holiday in the republic to mark the first
anniversary of Russia's move to wrest control of its resources away from the
Kremlin.;    Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev refused to say who got his
vote after he cast his ballot in Moscow. But he stressed that he is willing to
work with the winner.;    "I am ready to cooperate with anyone who will be
elected by Russians," Gorbachev said. "There will be no problems from my
side.";    It is clear, however, that a Yeltsin victory would represent a
distinct threat to Gorbachev, who has never faced a popular election. Yeltsin
would be able to claim that he alone has a democratic mandate to speak for the
people of the Soviet Union's largest republic.;    Ryzhkov, at another polling
station, said: "Social tension is high, and if we make drastic decisions that
affect people's lives, there will be unpredictable consequences. . . . I
cannot allow Russia and the rest of the country to be divided into two camps,
one camp for Gorbachev and the other for Ryzhkov or some other person.";    In
other results, the radical leaders of Moscow and Leningrad, Gavriil Popov and
Anatoly A. Sobchak, appeared to have won election over conservative rivals as
executive mayors with greater executive powers, according to the independent
Russian Information Agency.;    A proposal to change the name of Leningrad
back to St. Petersburg reportedly won the approval of 55 percent of the voters
in a non-binding referendum, but the ballot counting was not yet complete.;   
Even from the preliminary reports gathered by the Russian Information Agency
and other independent news organizations from across Russia, the size of
Yeltsin's victory was impressive.;    In constituencies as diverse as the
Soviet navy's Pacific fleet, fishermen and merchant sailors at sea, mining
towns beyond the Arctic Circle, Siberia's great industrial centers, the
ancient cities of European Russia and regions along the Chinese and Mongolian
borders, Yeltsin won the support of 55 percent to 80 percent of the voters,
according to unofficial reports from the Russian Information Agency.;    Such
a victory, demonstrating a strong majority support across the country, should
boost Yeltsin's political stature considerably.; Boris Yeltsin ahead in
election; (box) Born: Feb 1, 1931, in Butka, Siberia, in Russian republic;

<P>
Boris Yeltsin was elected president of the Russian republic with more than 50
percent of the vote, election officials said today.;    His victory in the
first popular balloting for Russian president was certain to accelerate
reforms across the Soviet Union.  
</P>
<P>
By winning up to 57 percent of the vote, Yeltsin avoided a run-off and
strengthened his hand against Communist Party stalwarts who oppose his program
to transfer ownership of state-owned farms and factories to individuals.;   
The victory cleared the way for the white-haired Siberian to travel to
Washington next week, at the invitation of members of Congress, in a
demonstration of his independence from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.;
The White House today applauded Yeltsin's election as "a good sign" for
democracy and said he would visit the White House next Thursday.;   
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush wants to discuss
with Yeltsin "his new position and to discuss the future of the Russian
Republic as well as any other matters he wants to talk about."; Yeltsin's
Russian republic has more than half the nation's 285 million people,
three-fourths of its territory and most of its natural wealth and industry.;  
Two other radical reformers, Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov and Leningrad Mayor
Anatoly Sobchak, also won, according to preliminary results. Popov received
65.11 percent of the vote, and Sobchak 65.5 percent, commission officials
said.;    And a 54 percent majority in Leningrad voted to restore that city to
its original czarist name, St. Petersburg, election officials said. Gorbachev
and other Communist Party officials oppose dropping the current name, which
honors Vladimir Lenin, founder of the Soviet Union.;    The chairman of the
Central Election Commission, Vasily Kazakov, was quoted by the state news
agency Tass as saying that Yeltsin has won a majority, and "a second round in
the elections for the president of Russia, apparently will not take place.";  
Alexander Zamyatin, another member of the commission, said Yeltsin was
winning, but said t the results were "preliminary. We cannot give official
results until June 22.";    Democracy is still in its infancy in Russia, and
election officials said they were laboriously counting paper ballots cast at
each of the 98,000 polling stations, stretching from the Pacific to the Baltic
coasts. Election officials were unable to say precisely what percentage of the
vote had been counted.;    The 61-year-old Yeltsin was resting at home, his
office said, and planned no immediate comment on Wednesday's historic vote.;  
Yeltsin's closest rival, former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov was
supported by the hard-line Russian Communist Party, and advocated a more
gradual transition from a centrally planned to a market economy.;   
Gorbachev, who has never faced a popular election, did not endorse any of the
six candidates for the newly created post of Russian president. He declared
after he voted Wednesday: "I am ready to cooperate with anyone who will be
elected by Russians. There will be no problems from my side.";    Yeltsin said
after casting his ballot that the election was "a celebration of the Russian
Federation's sovereignty. For the first time in its 1,000-year history, the
Russian people are electing their president in a direct vote.";    Four of
Yeltsin's opponents are members of the Communist Party, and party elders were
widely thought to have flooded the field with candidates to block Yeltsin from
a first round victory.;    Preliminary results showed Yeltsin won:;    (check)
75 percent of votes in Moscow.;    (check) 67.5 percent in Leningrad, the
second-largest Soviet city.;    (check) 90 percent in his hometown of
Sverdlovsk, in the Ural Mountains.;    (check) 81 percent in the Pacific and
Indian Ocean Navy fleets, and about two-thirds of the vote among fishing
fleets off Nakhodka on the Sea of Japan.;    (check) 74 percent of votes cast
by officers and students of a special secondary school intended to train
Soviet Interior Ministry staff in Rostov-on-Don.;    Tass, quoting
unidentified "trustworthy sources," said Yeltsin received an average of
between 60 and 70 percent of the vote in major industrial cities. The agency
also said Yeltsin won the most votes in rural areas, countering predictions
that Ryzhkov was stronger among farmers.;    The three-week campaign was not
as boisterous as a Western election, with most of the campaigning confined to
factories and auditoriums. Only Yeltsin drew large rallies as he stumped
across the Russian heartland.;    Besides Ryzhkov, his challengers were former
Soviet Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin, who also enjoys Communist support;
Gen. Albert Makashov, a hard-line law-and-order Communist; Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, head of the tiny Liberal Democratic Party; and Aman Tuleyev, a
Siberian active in the trade union movement.;  Boris Yeltsin elected

   Yeltsin's Win Foreshadows End of Empire

<P>
The election of Boris Yeltsin to the presidency of the
Russian republic is a stunning personal defeat for Mikhail
Gorbachev. For more than two years, Mr. Gorbachev has used
the propaganda mills of the Communist Party to discredit his
former Politburo colleague. Mr. Yeltsin's victory gives
further impetus to the social and political forces that are
tearing apart the last great empire.
</P>
<P>
From the platform of the Russian presidency, Mr. Yeltsin
is certain to strike a triple blow against Mr. Gorbachev's
political line. He will challenge the Soviet president on the
question of economic reform - Mr. Yeltsin favors a "no" vote
on the Soviet government's referendum on economic austerity.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Yeltsin will also oppose the policy of imperial
centralism that holds the republics in the thrall of the
central ministries that control nearly 95% of economic
output. As a leader elected by a legislature that is the
product of the most open election the Soviet Union has seen,
he will challenge the legitimacy of Mr. Gorbachev's
presidency, perhaps to the point of forcing a new unionwide
election.
In recent months Mr. Yeltsin has positioned himself as a
tradition-oriented politician looking back to basic Russian
values and lamenting the destruction of the Russian village.
</P>
<P>
His electoral platform and the movement that supported him -
Democratic Russia - represents an inward-looking Russian
nationalism that promotes Russia's sovereignty against the
state apparat and has little in common with Russian
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
On May 4, while visiting Spain, Mr. Yeltsin criticized Mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's blockade of Lithuania. A Spanish newspaper
reported that he also called for the emergence of "an
independent Russian republic" that "as an independent state
would sign agreements with other republics, also as
independent states." In Mr. Yeltsin's view, it would then be
up to the various sovereign republics to determine whether
they should be part of a federation or confederation, or
fully independent.
</P>
<P>
Among non-Russian peoples fighting for economic and
political sovereignty, the Yeltsin victory is greeted with
unalloyed delight. One leader of Sajudis, the Lithuanian
independence movement, anticipated Mr. Yeltsin's success when
I met him in late April. "He'll sign a trade agreement
between Russia and Lithuania. He'll challenge the blockade,"
the Lithuanian leader predicted. Just three months ago, in an
interview in an Estonian daily, Mr. Yeltsin came out
four-square for "maximum independence" for the republics.
</P>
<P>
Independence-minded Georgians and Azerbaijanis, too,
regard Mr. Yeltsin favorably. He is on record denouncing the
brutal murders of non-Russian demonstrators by Soviet troops
in 1989 and 1990, and has gone after Marshal Dmitri Yazov,
who, says Mr. Yeltsin, "must answer for Tbilisi and Baku."
Mr. Yeltsin's victory shows how far the process of
democratization and radicalization has gone in the past 15
months. It also shows Mr. Yeltsin's keen political sense. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and his reformist cohorts scored their electoral
victory in March elections to Russia's Parliament by playing
to a major shift in Russian public opinion, which is warming
to the idea of surrendering domination of non-Russian
peoples.
</P>
<P>
There are many important signs of this turn inward. A
public-opinion poll conducted in late February by the Soviet
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Sociology in cities across
the Soviet Union indicated that 52.4% of those polled
supported the right of union republics to secede. Another 14%
partly endorsed this right and only 7% were clearly opposed.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Russians are opting out of the empire with their feet
and leaving the non-Russian republics in droves. Between 1979
and 1989, nearly two million citizens - most of them ethnic
Russians - left the non-Russian republics to return to the
Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
As president of a republic of 147 million, Mr. Yeltsin
will be confronted with a new constituency - the 25 million
Russians who live in the non-Russian republics. Mr. Yeltsin
realizes that this group could represent a force for the
maintenance of empire. But, to diffuse this time bomb, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, according to reports in the Soviet press, favors a
"law of return." Such a law would, in effect, include a
transitional program for the orderly withdrawal of worried
Russians from the non-Russian republics.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, Mr. Yeltsin will be an advocate of
a multiparty system and an opponent of Lenin's principle of
"democratic centralism." He already has called for
dismantling the Communist Party's vast salaried apparat and
supplanting it with a party based largely on volunteers and
democratically accountable officials. He also will work for
the "depoliticization" of the army, the Interior Ministry and
the KGB "by eliminating the political organs in them" and
breaking officer links with the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, Mr. Yeltsin's thinking is a bit
fuzzier. He opposes half-hearted reforms that impose
austerities on Soviet workers. His economic prescriptions
include a rapid transition to currency convertibility from
the current three-tiered monetary structure. In Mr. Yeltsin's
view, enterprises that produce goods in excess of state
orders could sell their products on the free market. Any
proceeds from sales would be in the form of a single currency
with which enterprises could improve wages, increase capital
investments and purchase needed consumer goods for workers
and for workplace-related educational facilities.
</P>
<P>
Whether Mr. Yeltsin is the leader of the future, however,
remains to be seen. While he is popular with the Soviet
public, the new Russian president is regarded by younger
radicals, who backed his bid for office, as a man of limited
ability. He may well turn out to be a Soviet version of Imre
Posgay, the radical Hungarian Communist reformer who laid the
groundwork for democracy in his country in 1989 and then was
defeated in his quest for his country's presidency by an
ungrateful electorate.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Mikhail Gorbachev embarks on
a U.S. visit while facing a challenge from a formidable
political rival. The last time he was here that rival was the
arch-conservative Yegor Ligachev, whom Mr. Gorbachev would
later outmaneuver and defeat. This time, with Boris Yeltsin,
he may not be as lucky. But at least he's prepared. Just a
couple of weeks ago, the Soviet Parliament passed a law
guaranteeing a pension, "dacha" and private limousine for
retired Soviet presidents.

<P>
MOSCOW - Boris Yeltsin coasted to a comfortable victory
in the Russian republic's first presidential election, in a
vote that underscored the strong public desire for change and
the dwindling influence of the Soviet Communist
establishment.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Mr. Yeltsin, who is promising swift moves
to establish greater democracy and market economics, was
widely tipped to win the election in Russia, which, with 150
million of the Soviet Union's 285 million people, is by far
the country's largest republic. But the ease with which he
was elected in the first round of voting and the poor showing
by his Communist Party rivals gave him a strong mandate for
genuine reform that is likely to have repercussions on the
national political scene.
In Washington, the White House welcomed Mr. Yeltsin's
election, and invited him to meet with President Bush next
Thursday, a meeting Mr. Yeltsin had sought for months. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was to be in Washington as a guest of the Senate
leadership, but until winning the election he had been
shunned by the White House. On his last trip to the U.S. in
1989, Mr. Bush had only "dropped in" briefly on a meeting Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was holding with National Security adviser Brent
Scowcroft.
</P>
<P>
In general, the Bush administration has avoided doing
anything to add to Mr. Yeltsin's stature as a rival to Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, whose strong personal ties to
Mr. Bush underlie current U.S.-Soviet relations. But
administration officials said Mr. Yeltsin's democratic
election, and his new working partnership with Mr. Gorbachev,
have changed the situation.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many analysts believe Mr.Gorbachev now has no
choice but to work with Mr. Yeltsin, his erstwhile rival, to
transform the Soviet Union at a more rapid pace than the
Soviet leader's Communist allies are advocating. The two men
recently put aside their strong personal differences and
started cooperating on a new federal structure that would
decentralize much political and economic power to the
nation's 15 republics.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Yeltsin's election "is a gigantic historic step
forward," said Gavriil Popov, the reformist mayor of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"It will give additional stimulus to that process" of
cooperation between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary election results gave Mr. Yeltsin an outright
victory with about 60% of the vote, defying some predictions
that a second round of balloting would be needed. His main
opponent, former Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, came in a
poor second with between 15% and 20%. One of the biggest
surprises was the strong showing by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who
finished third with about 7%.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Zhirinovsky, almost unknown a month ago, campaigned
hard on a populist, anti-Communist platform. He easily
defeated the other three candidates, who included a hard-line
Communist general, a former interior minister close to Mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and a worker from the Siberian coal fields.
</P>
<P>
Much of the campaign turned on the issue of how quickly
change should come to Russia, particularly economic reform.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Messrs. Yeltsin and Zhirinovsky, all
other candidates warned against moving too fast to destroy
the decaying socialist system. Mr. Ryzhkov, in particular,
strongly opposed the introduction of private property and
said the government should move very gradually to sell off
any state assets.
</P>
<P>
But the Russian public, tired of years of half-measures
that have merely reduced their already low living standards,
clearly rejected the idea of yet more caution. It remains to
be seen if Mr. Yeltsin can live up to his campaign promise
that the economy will start to turn around within a year or
two. As chairman of the Russian parliament since 1990, he has
introduced much new economic legislation. But it has had
little effect, largely because of a crippling deadlock
between Russia and Mr. Gorbachev's central authorities that
now appears to have ended.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Yeltsin's aides say he is now likely to push for
radical economic measures, including large-scale
privatization, lower military spending and the introduction
of private farming. But opponents, and even some supporters,
say that even such moves may not fill the empty shelves of
stores as quickly as Mr. Yeltsin hopes.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Ryzkhov's main support came from the military,
industry and the government bureaucracy. Despite their
considerable powers, they failed to persuade voters to back
their candidate. "Only the official structures of power
supported Ryzhkov," said sociologist Yuri Levada.
</P>
<P>
A glaring example of the establishment's declining clout
came at the Lenin collective farm near the town of Vladimir.
</P>
<P>
Its managers were among the first to nominate Mr. Ryzhkov for
president. But in the voting, a majority of the 1,130 workers
ignored their bosses and opted for Mr. Yeltsin. The
unofficial Russian information agency said Mr. Ryzhkov was
backed by just 18% of the farm laborers; 51% voted for Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin. Further indicating the rout of the establishment,
two allies of Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Popov and Anatoly Sobchak,
were easily elected mayors of Moscow and Leningrad
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Yeltsin has said he will try to forge a broad
coalition for change, one that includes reform-minded members
of the Communist Party as well as more radical anti-Communist
democrats. On the campaign trail, he sought to present
himself as a responsible, presidential figure who could keep
his emotions in check. Seeking to build bridges to his former
adversaries, he even picked an air force colonel and
Communist Party member, Alexander Rutskoi, as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
As expected, he won strongest support from city dwellers
throughout the Russian republic. He captured 90% of the vote
in his hometown of Sverdlovsk and more than 70% in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
But the total was pushed down by rural dwellers, who are
traditionally more conservative. And the outcome was far less
of a landslide than the 89% support Mr. Yeltsin won in Moscow
in 1989, when he ran for the national parliament.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say his popularity appears to have
peaked since he gave up his stance as the rebel outsider
fighting the system and became chairman of the Russian
parliament. "He wasn't absolutely dominant," said Andrei
Zdravomyslov, president of the Soviet Sociologists
Association. Mr. Levada said some voters may have been irked
by the slow pace of practical change in Russia under Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's leadership. "People are growing tired of waiting,"
the sociologist added.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Yeltsin's more conciliatory stance has made it easier
for Mr. Gorbachev to distance himself from Communist
hardliners, who seemed to have the upper hand only six months
ago. Sergei Parkhomenko, a political analyst for the liberal
Independent newspaper, said he suspects Mr. Gorbachev
actually wanted Mr. Yeltsin to beat Mr. Ryzhkov, a comment
echoed by other analysts who hope that the U.S.S.R. is now on
the way toward more decisive reforms.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Gorbachev was careful not to take sides during the
campaign, saying only that he was prepared to work with any
winner, including Mr. Yeltsin.

<P>
MOSCOW - For the first time since the overthrow of the
Czar in 1917, the Soviet Union has been seized by the
collective will of its people.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic climax to the coup in Moscow, the
hard-liners who took power Monday were forced to capitulate
yesterday by defiant protesters and a determined Russian
Parliament that held firm against tanks and threats. Boris
Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic, led that
resistance from the embattled parliament building in Moscow
and seemed to tower over the hard-liners during the tense
standoff. He now emerges as easily the most powerful man in
the nation.
By rallying the general public and parts of the army
against the eight leaders of the coup, Mr. Yeltsin showed
that democratic changes ushered in by President Mikhail
Gorbachev over the past six years have had an enormous - and
perhaps irreversible - effect on the U.S.S.R. The defeat of
the hard-liners is widely expected to speed efforts to
transform the Soviet Union into a stronger democracy based on
a new federal system of decentralized power and market
economics. It also provides a unique opportunity for the
nation's legitimate leaders to purge the remains of the old
totalitarian system.
</P>
<P>
"The failure of the coup marks the Soviet Union's
transformation into a kind of modern European society," says
Francis Fukuyama, a former State Department official who has
written about the meaning of the collapse of communism. "It
proves that Gorbachev's revolution hasn't been just a
revolution of elites, that there's been this spontaneous
development of a political consensus among Russians."
But while jubilation filled the streets and squares of
cities throughout the country, and while columns of armored
vehicles retreated from Moscow's center, many people were
cautioning that difficult times lie ahead: The hard-liners
may have been ejected, they say, but the vast problems of
reviving the moribund Soviet economy and streamlining its
central government remain. Both could take years to
accomplish and could usher in new periods of unrest,
particularly in Soviet republics eager to exercise autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"There is no stability in the country at the moment, we
recognize that fact," said Foreign Minister Alexander
Bessmertnykh. Restoring coherence to the economy and
government is "the greatest task facing us."
Mr. Gorbachev's future role in bringing about stability is
uncertain. Late last night, he returned to Moscow from the
Crimea, where he was vacationing when the coup occurred and
where he spent the last three days under house arrest. On
arriving at the Moscow airport, Mr. Gorbachev stepped down
the stairs from his plane, shook hands with waiting aides and
was taken by motorcade to his home.
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent television broadcast, a tanned and
vigorous-looking Mr. Gorbachev called the failure of the coup
"a great victory for perestroika." He proclaimed his respect
for the Soviet people and, specifically, Mr. Yeltsin and said
he had been "surrounded" by troops during his house arrest.
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to break the will of the president and his
family," he said. "But they lost, it just didn't happen." Mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he would describe the details of his house
arrest at a later time when he convenes a "broad conference"
of Soviet leaders.
</P>
<P>
But the 60-year-old Soviet president may be surprised by
the circumstances that greet him today, for the balance of
political power in the country has shifted clearly in Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's favor. Thanks to his popular mandate, the feisty
Mr. Yeltsin was able to withstand the very forces that
deposed Mr. Gorbachev, his longtime rival.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many people in Moscow are starting to talk
about Mr. Gorbachev in the past tense, predicting he will
play a more symbolic than substantive role in the future.
</P>
<P>
Some even contend that he will stay on only briefly as an
interim figure, and then be forced out by public opinion. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev himself helped bring about the coup, these people
argue, because he elevated most of its ringleaders to high
posts in his government and kept them there despite dire
warnings from both his detractors and supporters.
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev created the possibilities for such a coup to
take place," says Valery Lunin, a chemistry professor at
Moscow University and member of the Russian Parliament. "He
should resign, although perhaps not at once, and allow
elections to be held."
Mr. Gorbachev's future now rests largely in his own hands.
</P>
<P>
If he acts decisively to punish the leaders of the coup and
purge his administration of their supporters, he could regain
some of his popularity, which eroded as the economy worsened
in recent years. But any wavering - something he has done
often - could relegate him to a minor role.
</P>
<P>
Whatever he does, the Soviet Union seems headed for a
period of fundamental change that could have a major impact
on the way it deals with the outside world. Mr. Yeltsin, 60,
is expected to press relentlessly for the Kremlin to
relinquish most of its administrative powers to the
increasingly assertive republics. For the nation as a whole,
that could create considerable upheaval as newly "sovereign"
republics attempt to build a federal system from the bottom
up.
</P>
<P>
For the West, the problem of balancing relations with the
Kremlin and with individual Soviet republics is likely to
worsen. Mr. Yeltsin himself, who has sought a greater voice
in international affairs, clearly relished his contacts with
world leaders during the crisis. He told the Russian
Parliament Wednesday of his conversations with heads of state
ranging from President Bush to France's Francois Mitterrand
and British Prime Minister John Major, proclaiming proudly
that "they all support the Russian leadership."
The 64-hour coup disintegrated with astonishing speed.
</P>
<P>
After seizing power and deposing Mr. Gorbachev at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Monday, the eight-man committee headed by Vice President
Gennady Yanayev and including the Soviet prime minister, the
defense minister, the interior minister and the KGB chief,
soon found the tables turning.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday the regime was under fierce verbal attack not
just from Mr. Yeltsin, but from tens of thousands of Soviet
protesters, the leaders of many republics, and the
governments of virtually every country in the world. The
loyalty of the army was being sorely tested; a handful of
divisions switched sides to protect the Russian leadership in
its parliament building. Even hard-liners who had been
expected to support the junta condemned it for what they
called its "illegal" actions.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, hundreds of unarmed volunteers stood
outside the white parliament building on the Moskva river,
nervous about rumors of an imminent armed assault. It never
came. At least three civilians were killed in a brief clash
around midnight, when a column of six light tanks stormed a
barricade near the parliament. But the troops quickly backed
off, and the rest of the night was quiet.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Parliament convened for an emergency session
Wednesday, and after three hours of debate, Mr. Yeltsin
suddenly announced that the coup leaders were "heading to the
airport for an unknown destination." Amid growing excitement,
he ordered them to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, the hundreds of tanks and armored
cars positioned around the Soviet capital started to
withdraw. Russian officials said top Defense Ministry and
general staff brass had issued the order after a brief
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Within hours, a delegation of two Russian republic
officials and four Gorbachev aides flew to the Crimea to meet
with the Soviet president. He had been held incommunicado
since the beginning of the coup, guarded by 32 KGB officers
with machine guns in his spacious yellow dacha in Foros, at
the southern tip of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line regime had justified its takeover by saying
that Mr. Gorbachev was incapacitated by poor health. The
officials quickly discovered otherwise. Arkady Volsky, a
Gorbachev aide, declared the health problems "a gross
invention." He also reported that the coup had taken place
after the eight-man committee had tried and failed to
pressure Mr. Gorbachev into signing a statement imposing a
state of emergency on the nation.
</P>
<P>
By 8 p.m., the coup was officially over and Mr. Gorbachev
announced he was "in full control of the situation and {had}
restored contact with the country, broken off as a result of
the adventurist actions of a group of state officials." After
telephone conversations with leaders of five of the 15 Soviet
republics and with President Bush, Mr. Gorbachev headed for
Moscow from the Crimea.
</P>
<P>
Even before the coup ended, the nation started returning
to normal. Soviet television, which had been broadcasting a
diet of classical music and black-and-white patriotic movies
throughout the previous two days, suddenly switched to
showing the Russian Parliament session. Russian radio resumed
its broadcasts, and all restrictions on the media were
lifted. In Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, Soviet troops
retreated from television and radio stations they occupied
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Baltic states remained tense,
however: According to news wire reports, gunfire was reported
in Vilnius, Lithuania, where one person was shot dead, and a
Latvian died from injuries received when the Soviets this
week took over the radio station where he worked. Some U.S.
analysts are predicting that the coup and the forces it has
unleashed have dramatically increased the chances that the
Baltic states will win their independence. During the coup,
Estonia and Latvia unilaterally declared their independence,
a move Lithuania took last year but which Soviet troops
thwarted.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet federal prosecutor's office, meanwhile,
announced that it had started criminal proceedings against
the eight coup leaders. At one point early yesterday, there
were reports that four of the eight had flown to Mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's vacation home in the Crimea to make a personal
appeal to him. But this couldn't be confirmed. Last night,
Reuter reported that Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president of
the Russian republic, said one plotter, Vladimir Kryuchkov,
chairman of the KGB, had been arrested and would be tried.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of the other seven leaders of the coup wasn't
immediately known.
</P>
<P>
As news of the rapid developments spread, hundreds of
jubilant Russians braved the rain and streamed toward the
parliament building, which was bedecked in the Russian white,
blue and red national tricolor. "We can say that today is the
last day of Soviet Communism, and it's a rainy one," one
parliament deputy, Yevgeny Ambartsumov, shouted down to the
crowd from a first-floor balcony. "Yeltsin, Yeltsin," the
crowd shouted back.
</P>
<P>
But some were already looking to the future, and sounding
more cautious. "A 70-year nightmare doesn't end that
quickly," said Nikolai Medvedev, a member of the national
parliament.
</P>
<P>
As the future takes shape for the Soviet Union, one thing
is certain: U.S. relations with the country will never be the
same.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three days, Mr. Bush became a vocal partner
of Mr. Yeltsin's in the effort to oust the Communist
hardliners who launched the coup. The U.S. now seems to be
moving inexorably toward recognizing the charismatic Russian
leader as the rising force in the Soviet Union. Mr. Bush, who
has struggled for two years to balance relations between his
friend Mr. Gorbachev and the unabashedly pro-Western Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, confirmed that relations with Mr. Yeltsin will now
be different. "They have taken a quantum leap forward now by
this man's displayed courage and by his commitment to
democracy," he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
By moving closer to Mr. Yeltsin, the U.S. inevitably will
also be moving closer to his vision for the Soviet Union,
which sees the U.S.S.R. as a political umbrella but Russia
and the other Soviet republics with vastly expanded freedoms
and power; some republics, particularly the Baltic states,
would acquire their complete independence from Moscow. The
triumph of Mr. Yeltsin is also likely to give new impetus to
proposals for truly radical shock therapy for the Soviet
economy, which Mr. Gorbachev avoided.
</P>
<P>
But a new relationship with Mr. Yeltsin doesn't mean Mr.
</P>
<P>
Bush will abandon his friendship with Mr. Gorbachev. In fact,
their personal bond was evident yesterday when Mr. Bush spoke
with the Soviet leader by phone.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bush was in his boat in the waters off his vacation
home in Maine when Mr. Gorbachev finally was able to return
the repeated calls Mr. Bush had made during the coup. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Bush went ashore and took the call in the bedroom of his
home, with Barbara Bush at his side. Later, he told aides the
conversation was an emotional one in which Mr. Gorbachev was
effusive in his thanks for American support during the
unrest.
</P>
<P>
"The personal thing kicked in," says one administration
official. "It was emotional for both of them." Later, an
obviously relieved Mr. Bush declared that "freedom and
democracy have prevailed." And he insisted that there isn't
any "Gorbachev versus Yeltsin battle."
Moreover, it isn't just Mr. Bush who still has a strong
link to Mr. Gorbachev. If anything, West European leaders
have been even more committed to Mr. Gorbachev. They worry
about any push for radical Soviet changes that might produce
chaos and instability on their eastern borders - and a
possible halt to the withdrawal of Soviet troops from German
soil.
</P>
<P>
That means that an American drift closer to Mr. Yeltsin
isn't risk-free. It could produce strains and differences in
approach between Washington and its European allies if the
drift is too pronounced.
</P>
<P>
Still, there probably isn't any way for Mr. Bush to avoid
moving closer to the policies and tactics Mr. Yeltsin
espouses. "Boris Yeltsin's actions during this coup attempt
- his courage and his ability to exercise charismatic
leadership - offer the greatest possible hope of some
leadership for the future," said Sen. Richard Lugar
yesterday. "My own view is that, by and large, Gorbachev is a
spent force."
As it became apparent that the coup was falling apart,
some of those in the Soviet Union who had supported it rushed
for cover. Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov, a member of the
eight-man committee, was said by his deputy to have agreed to
take part in the coup because "he had been misled by the
information on the state of health of the Soviet president."
Senior officials of the Soviet Communist Party, which is
believed to have played a supporting role in the takeover,
quickly distanced themselves from the coup leaders and
declared the action to have been unlawful. Sensing that
reprisals could be in the air, they also warned against
jumping to hasty conclusions about who is guilty. "Some
forces will probably try to use the situation to strike a
blow at the Soviet Communist Party," said Sergei Kalashnikov,
a nervous secretary of the party's central committee. He said
the coup leaders shouldn't be described as a "junta," but
acknowledged that they had "blundered in a difficult
situation."
In fact, both sympathizers and opponents of the coup were
united in a belief that the whole affair had been handled
with extraordinary clumsiness. The emergency committee
clearly failed to anticipate the fierce reaction from Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and the general public. And once it came, it seemed
at a loss as to how to deal with it and lacked the nerve to
carry out a bloody assault on the Russian Parliament, the
focus of protest.
</P>
<P>
"We must admit that mistakes by the junta let us gather
people and continue disseminating information," said Gleb
Yakunin, a Russian Orthodox priest and reform-minded member
of the Russian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The coup leaders also alienated some potential hard-line
allies by saying they planned to continue with Mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's policies. "The committee was created because of
the catastrophic situation in the country caused by
Gorbachev's policies," said Col. Viktor Alksnis, a critic of
the Soviet president and leader of the Soyuz parliamentary
group. "But Yanayev publicly praised Gorbachev. If he {Mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev} was so good, where was the need to get rid of
him?"
According to several sources, Marshal Dmitri Yazov, the
defense minister and a member of the eight-man committee, may
have played an important role in bringing about the coup's
collapse. He appears to have had major reservations about
ordering troops to attack the parliament building. "It seems
to me that Yazov was just sucked into a political game. He
didn't want bloodshed," said Konstantin Kobets, the head of
the Russian defense committee who is well connected with the
army's general staff.
</P>
<P>
The future of the entire army now seems certain to become
a serious point of contention as Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev
and leaders of the other republics move to build a new
federal structure.
</P>
<P>
Until the failed coup, there had been a tacit agreement to
preserve a single army. But the events of the past few days
have driven home to Mr. Yeltsin and his aides how vulnerable
they are without some defense force of their own. Mr. Kobets
and other top Russian officials now talk about the need to
form a Russian national guard. And some radicals want Mr.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin to take another, far more critical look at the entire
union treaty he, Mr. Gorbachev and two other republican
leaders had been expected to sign on Tuesday. The treaty is
designed to transfer some powers from the central government
to the republics, and is believed to have precipitated the
coup.
</P>
<P>
"Many Russian deputies say they don't want the treaty to
be signed as it stands," says Sergei Belosertsev, a reformist
member of the republic's legislature. "The latest events show
how much still has to be done, including the clauses on the
army. Yeltsin will be wiser after the {coup}. He was in too
much of a hurry before."
Whatever the fate of the union treaty, Mr. Yeltsin is
already confident about one of its key economic clauses. He
told the Russian Parliament that if the treaty had been
signed, President Gorbachev would have immediately handed
over jurisdiction of all factories in Russia to the republic.
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Mr. Yeltsin went ahead and ordered the
transfer himself. He also stole a march on the Soviet
president by firing the head of state-run TV, a notorious
hard-liner.
</P>
<P>
For many Russians, though, yesterday was a time to
celebrate, not to worry about the future. As barricades began
to come down, the libations came out. "I'm drunk," said
Stepan Kisilyov, deputy editor of the reformist weekly,
Moscow News, which was banned during the coup. Speaking over
the phone in the early hours of Thursday morning, he added:
"The whole editorial board has been drinking cognac all
night. We won] We won]"

</P>
<P>
THE AUGUST COUP
</P>
<P>
MONDAY, AUG. 19
- Around dawn in Moscow, an eight-member "State Committee
for the State of Emergency," headed by Vice President Gennady
Yanayev, says it has taken over all power in the Soviet
Union. It Says that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has
been replaced because of health reasons. The publication of
major independent newspapers is suspended.
- Troops move into Moscow, and later seize radio and
television stations in the Baltic republics.
- Thousands of demonstrators assemble around the Russian
republic's parliament, where Russian President Boris Yeltsin
remains defiant of the coup.
- Mr. Yeltsin climbs atop a tank outside parliament and
urges a general strike to protest the coup. He warns that
"clouds of terror and dictatorship are gathering over the
whole country," and calls for the restoration of power of mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev.
- On Monday morning in Kennebunkport, Maine, President
Bush says the coup is "disturbing" and appears to be
"extra-constitutional." He expresses support for Mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and says he will "follow the events very carefully
as they unfold in order to determine the appropriate
response."
- President Bush later issues a statement from Washington
stiffening his criticism and condemning "the unconstitutional
resort to force." The statement supports Mr. Yeltsin's call
for returning power to legally elected leaders and says the
U.S. "will avoid in every possible way any actions that would
lend legitimacy or support to the coup attempt."
</P>
<P>
TUESDAY, AUG. 20
- In the morning, Bush says he has recently spoken with
Mr. Yeltsin and that he reaffirmed U.S. support for
constitutionally chosen Soviet leaders. Mr. Bush adds that
"there will be no normal relations with the United States as
long as this illegal coup remains in effect."
- During the day, allied countries halt aid to the Soviet
Union. The European Community freezes action on more than $1
billion in technical aid and credit guarantees. The U.S.
</P>
<P>
Export-Import Bank suspends its new Soviet program, and
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu tells his parliament
that export credits will be put on hold.
- In Moscow, Soviet television reports that Prime
Minister Valentin Pavlov, a member of the emergency
committee, has resigned because of poor health. Reports also
circulate that two other committee members, Defense Minister
Dmitri Yazov and KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov, have resigned.
- The Soviet Foreign Ministry says Foreign Minister
Alexander Bessmertnykh is ill after returing from vacation.
- Huge crowds in Moldavia, the Ukraine and Leningrad
protest the coup, while coal miners go on strike in several
regions.
- In the evening in Moscow, demonstrators near the
Russian republic's parliament clash with Soviet armored
vehicles. Soviet radio reports that at least three people are
killed.
</P>
<P>
WEDNESDAY, AUG. 21
- Troops begin moving out of Moscow. Soon the coup
leaders are reported to have left the city.
- Leaders of the Soviet parliament demand the
reinstatement of Mr. Gorbachev, and the legislature rescinds
the emergency committee's decrees.
- At 10:30 in the morning EDT, President Bush says he has
spoken with Mr. Yeltsin, who said that more and more troops
appear to be turning against the coup. Mr. Bush declines to
say that the crisis is over, but says the situation appears
"somewhat more positive."
- Shortly after noon, Mr. Bush says he has spoken to Mr.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who tells him that "the constitutional authorities
are back in power." Soviet television broadcasts a statement
by Mr. Gorbachev declaring that the coup is dead.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's Agenda
- With his triumph over the coup plotters, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin is in a far stronger position to
implement the reform measures for which he has long
campaigned. These measures include:
- Popular Elections to implement a "genuine democracy"
- Autonomy for the Soviet republics, a far more
decentralized government with vast powers transferred from
the Communists-dominated Kremlin
- Faster transition to a market economy with guarantees
of economic freedoms and rapid privatization of agriculture
and industry
- Dismantling of the stultifying central bureaucracy
- Lower military spending and greater leeway for
republics to conduct their own foreign policy
