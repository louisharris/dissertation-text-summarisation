KEATING SAYS REGULATORS CUT LINCOLN'S VALUE TO SEIZE IT 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
amp; Loan Assn., regulators arbitrarily 
wrote down the value of its $1.4-billion loan portfolio as 50% less and slashed 
the worth of its extensive land, hotel and stock holdings by 75%, the thrift's 
former owner said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Without any analysis, they took the entire loan portfolio and said it was 
non-performing," Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating Jr. testified in his 
fifth day on the witness stand in his suit seeking to recover the Irvine-based 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Reading from a Federal Home Loan Bank Board analysis of Lincoln's loan and 
equity portfolios prepared a week after the government imposed a 
conservatorship April 14, 1989, Keating called the numbers "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
The analysis, in the form of an April 21, 1989, memo from regulators in charge 
of the Lincoln case to bank board officials in Washington, is the first 
government document specifying regulators' estimate that alleged losses of 
federally insured deposits by the thrift could cost taxpayers $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The document estimated that the thrift's assets were worth only $2 billion to 
$2.5 billion, or $1.85 billion to $2.2 billion less than what they were listed 
on Lincoln's books at the time. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a year, Keating has asserted that he ran Lincoln soundly, and that 
regulators could show the thrift was insolvent only by placing a lower value on 
its assets. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the figures from the regulators' analysis with those provided by 
American Continental's chief financial officer, he testified Wednesday that 
only 3% of Lincoln's $1.4-billion mortage-loan portfolio was more than 60 days 
in default. 
</P>
<P>
All of the loans, Keating testified, were fully secured, with the borrowers 
putting up an average 20% down payment on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators, however, listed the value of those loans at only $703 million, 
accounting for a third of the losses they claim that Lincoln suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wurzelbacher, Keating's son-in-law who headed Lincoln's real estate 
investments, likened the analysis to a family buying a $100,000 home with a 
$20,000 down payment and an $80,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
Then a regulator comes in and says the value of the home and the loan on it is 
worth only $40,000, even though the monthly payments are still being made, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
James Murphy, an attorney representing the Treasury Department's Office of 
Thrift Supervision, repeatedly objected to Keating comparing the numbers from 
the regulators' April 21 analysis and Keating's own figures on the status of 
Lincoln's loans and equity holdings as of Dec. 31, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not by any stretch of the imagination the last word on the 
implementation of the receivership" four months later, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Thrift Supervision succeeded the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as 
the industry's chief regulator under the $50-billion savings and loan bailout 
passed last year by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The government seized control of Lincoln in April last year under the 
conservatorship, claiming that it was being grossly mismanaged but making no 
assertion at the time that it was insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until August that the regulators asserted that Lincoln's alleged 
losses actually exceeded the value of its assets and imposed a receivership 
that took ownership of the thrift from Keating. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin overruled Murphy's objections, but said he 
wanted testimony from Keating's chief financial officer in addition to hearing 
from regulators on their justifications for the writedowns. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't write down 50% on a mortgage portfolio," said Sporkin, who is a 
former accountant and was at one time the chief enforcement officer for the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's attorneys also introduced documents showing that regulators were 
unhappy with the performance of the consultant they hired at an annual salary 
of $300,000 to run Lincoln after seizing control from Keating. 
</P>
<P>
In a July 19, 1989, memo to the bank board's top officials in Washington, Mark 
Randall, the government official in charge of managing the conservatorship, 
said the consultant, Roger Clark, failed to address Lincoln's major problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger Clark's inaction, questionable judgment and lack of participation 
establish his inability to function as a CEO (chief executive officer) of 
Lincoln," Randall's memo read. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said that Clark still holds titles as both the CEO and chief financial 
officer of Lincoln under a contract that requires the government to pay him a 
$100,000 termination fee, but that other officials are actually running the 
thrift under the receivership.

LINCOLN S&#60;amp;L OWNER SPENT LAVISHLY TO GAIN POLITICAL INFLUENCE 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr. doesn't flinch when asked if his financial support of 
politicians is intended to influence them to take up his cause. "I want to say 
in the most forceful way I can, I certainly hope so," Keating recently 
proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Keating practices what he preaches. A review of campaign records by The Times 
shows that Keating, his companies and a circle of about 75 family members, 
associates and employees have showered more than $700,000 in campaign 
contributions on three dozen federal and state politicians over the last six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Loan, its principal 
subsidiary, was seized by federal regulators the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Critics charge that Keating and associates have coordinated their contributions 
in a deliberate effort to buy influence with powerful politicians. As evidence, 
they cite donations of about $300,000 to five U.S. senators who went to bat in 
April, 1987, for Keating in two unusual private meetings with savings and loan 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
'Concerned' About Seizure 
</P>
<P>
amp;L to a group headed by former Republican 
Rep. John Rousselot of San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he was concerned that the seizure would adversely affect the 
Arizona economy and hurt American Continental bondholders, most of whom are 
Californians. He and the other senators denied that Keating's contributions 
influenced their actions on behalf of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But others are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely clear to me that Mr. Keating and his cohorts had lots of help 
from the highest quarters, both financially and politically," said Joseph W. 
Cotchett Jr., an attorney representing American Continental bondholders who may 
have lost $200 million as a result of the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't show any favorites when it came to political parties," Cotchett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the recipients of Keating's largess have been in positions to help him 
in his business affairs and his escalating encounters with savings and loan 
regulators. And Keating is certainly in need of help these days. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L. 
Keating supplemented Lincoln's traditional home loans with investments in 
high-yield securities and riskier real estate ventures. 
</P>
<P>
amp;Ls across the country, 
spent much of the last three years poring over the books of Lincoln and 
American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L in an 
unsafe and unsound manner. 
</P>
<P>
The recipients of contributions from Keating's circle include liberal Democrats 
like Cranston and former presidential hopeful Walter Mondale. But most of the 
money went to the Republican Party and GOP stalwarts like Sen. Orrin Hatch of 
Utah, who shares Keating's brand of staunch conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
For Keating, campaign contributions are one way that the American political 
system is made more responsive to its constituents. It is practiced by 
executives at major corporations across the land. It is something he has been 
doing since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Outspoken Critic 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Keating plodded through the halls of Congress in search of allies in 
the war on pornography, a personal political crusade that he still pursues. In 
1980, he briefly ran the 1980 presidential campaign of former Texas Gov. John 
B. Connally. Connally's son, Mark, now is American Continental's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Keating contends that his contributions merely give him a fighting 
chance against hostile regulators who drove American Continental into 
bankruptcy proceedings because they didn't like his unconventional business 
strategies and his outspoken criticism of the regulatory structure. Elected 
officials, he has claimed, ought to come to his aid when the government 
bureaucracy runs amok with its regulatory authority. 
</P>
<P>
"We support and campaign for the political leaders we believe will represent 
the best of American virtues," he told reporters last month. "In the contract 
between the voter and the politician, we have the right to seek their help when 
needed and demand it when justified. This I have done." 
</P>
<P>
And he has done it in a big way, with the help of his firms, family members, 
business associates and employees. In the last five years, state and federal 
campaign records show: 
</P>
<P>
* More than $100,000 has gone to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and more than 
$55,000 to Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), both of Keating's home state. 
Congressmen from Arizona also have fared well, including Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who 
has received $20,950 while representing the district Keating lives in. 
</P>
<P>
* More than $52,000 has gone to the two California senators - Cranston and 
Republican Pete Wilson - who represent Lincoln's home base. Sen. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) has picked up $34,500 from Keating's circle. Keating was born in Ohio, 
and American Continental is incorporated there. 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly $166,000 has gone to 11 members of the Senate and House banking 
committees, where deregulation of the savings and loan industry was conceived 
and implemented in recent years, much to the dismay of some regulators. The 
largest amount, more than $70,000, was given to the Senate panel's current 
chairman, Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). Other members who received donations 
are Cranston, who got $39,100; Jacob (Chic) Hecht (R-Nev.), $19,000; Timothy E. 
Wirth (D-Colo.), $8,000; William L. Armstrong (R-Colo.), $7,000; Phil Gramm 
(R-Texas), $1,000, and Jacob Garn (R-Utah), $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
House committee members were Reps. Doug Barnard Jr. (D-Ga.), $16,000; Frank 
Annunzio (D-Ill.), $1,000; Stephen L. Neal (D-N.C.), $1,000, and Fernand J. St 
Germain (D-R.I.), $500. 
</P>
<P>
* At the California Statehouse, where gubernatorial appointees oversee Lincoln 
operations, Keating money has added $41,000 to Gov. George Deukmejian's 
campaign coffers in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
* Keating and associates pumped $80,000 into the California Republican Party 
last fall alone. Altogether, he has given the state GOP $97,500 in the last 
four years and has given $3,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. Such "soft" donations allow contributors to get around federal 
individual contribution limits of $1,000 per candidate per election. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last five years, there's no question that it has been important that we 
help those who supported the business areas we were in," Keating said in an 
interview last week. "I've always contributed across a broad spectrum of 
philosophical and political boundaries. But from my background, to do business 
(throughout) America, you need to be politically aware." 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Recall Mondale Gift 
</P>
<P>
With so much money flowing to so many candidates over so many years, Keating 
apparently cannot keep track of the politicians who benefited from his 
fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
He does not recall - and acted surprised when reminded - that he and his 
family gave $2,500 to Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign. Mondale "definitely 
has diverse views from me," said Keating, a conservative Republican. He said he 
probably responded to someone raising money for Mondale's campaign in the hope 
that he could solicit that person later for funds for one of his own favored 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Keating made no direct contributions in 1984 to one candidate 
who seemed to embody his conservative politics: President Ronald Reagan. 
Likewise, four years later, Keating did not contribute to President George 
Bush's campaign, although American Continental gave $80,000 to the California 
Republican Party. This money, which does not come under federal or state 
contribution limitations, was used for voter-registration and get-out-the-vote 
efforts that benefited Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has never been bashful about his political persuasion. And he has not 
hesitated to encourage employees to contribute to candidates who support 
deregulation of financial services, the bulwark upon which his business empire 
is built. 
</P>
<P>
One former executive of an American Continental subsidiary who requested 
anonymity said he made his only political donation ever - $500 - in 1987 
because he was made aware by Keating that Sen. Riegle was "in line 
philosophically with the business we were running." Riegle also was second in 
line at the time to take over as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, 
which he now heads. 
</P>
<P>
Keating frequently invited employees into the company's dining room to hear 
various politicians, said Deborah Karbo, a former vice president of another 
company subsidiary. After Riegle stopped by for a quick visit in March, 1987, 
she contributed $500 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
No Pressure 
</P>
<P>
Both former employees said their gift-giving was "entirely discretionary," as 
Karbo put it. The other former executive said there was "never any pressure" to 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said he "never put the arm" on anyone to make contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the donors may have reached independent decisions, they tended to 
reach them at the same time. For example, 51 donations from Keating, family 
members and associates were made to McCain on the same day: March 17, 1986. And 
a March 23, 1987, fund-raiser for Riegle netted 86 checks from Keating's 
circle. More than a third of those checks were executed on one day, March 12, 
and all but two of the rest were written on one of two other days that month. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Zelman, executive director of California Common Cause, said it isn't 
uncommon to see a large number of executives at a major firm contributing to a 
number of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
But, Zelman noted, "when the numbers get real large, there's a question of 
whether individuals are coerced or even encouraged to contribute." He said that 
encouraging contributions "gets borderline illegal really fast." 
</P>
<P>
Keating lashed out at those who would criticize him for legitimate fund-raising 
activities, saying the public is being "bullied into not contributing" to 
political campaigns by people who question every donation. 
</P>
<P>
Timing of Contributions 
</P>
<P>
In his case, he said, regulators are raising the campaign contribution issue to 
hold senators and congressmen in check while the federal agencies deal with 
Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that Keating has simply used donated dollars to get 
politicians to do his bidding. And the timing of the contributions raises 
questions about his motives. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle and Keating, for instance, met in Detroit on March 1, 1986, when Riegle 
attended the reopening of the renovated Pontchartrain Hotel, which Lincoln 
owned. A fund-raiser on March 23, 1987, netted Riegle more than $70,000, which 
Riegle returned a year later after Keating's contributions became a public 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle was one of five senators who met with regulators on April 9, 1987, to 
find out why a routine examination of Lincoln's financial condition was taking 
more than a year instead of the normal two to three months. Riegle's closest 
aide, Kevin Gottlieb, said the senator attended only at the written request of 
two colleagues, DeConcini and McCain. Cranston and Glenn also were at that 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L owner who had enough 
political pull to get five U.S. senators to meet with federal examiners about a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
At an earlier meeting, Cranston, McCain, DeConcini and Glenn had met with Edwin 
J. Gray, head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Gray later claimed that the 
four senators tried to cut a deal for Keating. He termed the effort a "gross 
violation of the integrity of the regulatory process . . . for the benefit of 
one person who happened to be a friend and contributor." 
</P>
<P>
Deny Impropriety 
</P>
<P>
The senators or their aides denied that any deal was offered or discussed. 
Glenn said he met only to find out why a constituent was having a problem with 
an unusually long regulatory examination. DeConcini's press secretary, Bob 
Maynes, said Gray "has a terrible memory or he's a liar." 
</P>
<P>
All of the senators involved said there was no impropriety in taking money from 
Keating and his fund-raisers and then representing him in a dispute with agency 
officials, something they said they do for all their constituents. Gottlieb 
said Riegle returned the money in March, 1988, only because local papers had 
written about it and the senator did not want it to become a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
An individual "does not suddenly become ineligible for any kind of constituent 
help because he's made a political contribution," Maynes said. 
</P>
<P>
In an Orange County Superior Court lawsuit, however, bondholders who purchased 
$200 million in apparently worthless American Continental debt securities claim 
Keating used his political connections to cover up an alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Keating used politicians - as well as former government 
employees he hired or retained - to keep regulators at bay while he continued 
to sell junk bonds to unsophisticated depositors. 
</P>
<P>
Keating vehemently denies the claims in the suit, one of several class actions 
filed in Southern California and Arizona. He said the bondholders' only chance 
at getting any money back is if control of Lincoln is returned to him. 
Regulators have never saved an institution they have seized, he said.

JUDGE REFUSES TO LOWER $5-MILLION BAIL FOR KEATING; 
COURTS: KEY FIGURE IN COLLAPSE OF LINCOLN SAVINGS &#60;amp; LOAN IS DEEMED A FLIGHT 
RISK AND IS ASSURED OF MORE JAIL TIME. BAIL IS LOWERED FOR THREE OF HIS 
CO-DEFENDANTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles judge Friday refused to reduce the $5-million bail for Charles H. 
Keating Jr., saying the Phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being 
indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Loan - has "significant reasons not to stay around." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that the 66-year-old Keating - a once-wealthy real estate 
developer, lawyer and influential political campaign contributor used to 
pin-striped suits - will spend more time in blue prison fatigues inside Los 
Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Klausner reduced bail for three Keating co-defendants from 
the $1 million he imposed Tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the 
former operators of American Continental Corp. and its former main subsidiary, 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for Judy J. Wischer, 42, former American Continental president, was 
lowered to $200,000. Bail for Robin S. Symes, 37, and Ray C. Fidel, 32, both 
former Lincoln presidents, was cut to $100,000. All three posted bail late 
Friday and were expected to be released during the night. 
</P>
<P>
The four are charged with wrongdoing in the sale of more than $200 million in 
American Continental bonds to thousands of mostly elderly Southern California 
investors. The bonds were sold through Lincoln branches, allegedly as safe and 
insured investments. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds became worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy in 
April, 1989. The next day Lincoln was declared insolvent and seized by federal 
regulators. The failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, indicated he would appeal Klausner's 
ruling. Keating will not flee and intends to fight to clear his name, Neal 
said. But the decision denies Keating access to his attorneys and to records so 
he can mount a defense effectively, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think (the decision) is unsupportable on the evidence that was introduced 
this week," Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had sought to have bail reduced to $500,000, an amount that could be 
paid by his family, Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
Neal argued that Keating, who three years ago had a net worth of nearly $40 
million, is broke. Keating's former accountant testified that his debts exceed 
his assets by $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, whose office has flip-flopped twice 
in its bail recommendations in the case, praised the decision not to reduce 
Keating's bail. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Keating is accused of cheating people out of their savings," Reiner said 
in a press conference after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"For many of them, it was their life savings. And whether somebody wears an 
expensive suit or a cheap mask, stealing is stealing and both of them ought to 
be treated the same." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision came after 1 1/2 days of testimony and arguments in the 
first criminal case to be filed in connection with the collapses of Lincoln and 
Phoenix-based American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, unshaven and looking tired, sat impassively in the prisoners' block as 
the judge announced his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Donald Smaltz, attorney for Symes, criticized Reiner and Klausner 
for their handling of the bail hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The most talked about event in the last several weeks has been the Iraqi 
invasion," Smaltz said. "The sole thing that replaced Saddam Hussein on the 
front page was Charles Keating, and Reiner's milking that for all it's worth." 
</P>
<P>
He also struck out at the judge, saying, "He's never going to get arrested for 
flashing his Phi Beta Kappa key. Bail is supposed to assure a defendant's 
appearance in court and must be within the means he could reasonably afford." 
</P>
<P>
Klausner also said he was "troubled" by the way the district attorney has 
equivocated on the bail issue. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when the indictments were unsealed, prosecutors did not object to 
releasing all the defendants on their own recognizance. On Wednesday, 
prosecutors said they were willing to recommend a reduction in bail to $1 
million for Keating and $50,000 for the others. Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul 
W. Turley argued against reducing the bail. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, who was appointed a special state prosecutor by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp to investigate Lincoln, said he was willing to let the defendants go 
without bail on Tuesday because he didn't want to face a difficult battle 
extraditing Keating from Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
After Klausner first ruled, Reiner said he then supported the bail set. But 
asked why his office changed his mind later, he said, "I'm not sure that I 
understand the semantic difference." 
</P>
<P>
While defense attorneys wouldn't say what they thought of the prosecutor's 
actions, other lawyers connected indirectly to the case scored Reiner for 
allegedly using the case and his changing views on Keating's bail to bolster 
his public image. 
</P>
<P>
Klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper 
bail, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing 
were the most important in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the hearing, defense attorneys brought witnesses and other evidence 
to court to show that their clients were destitute or nearly so. They argued 
that the defendants would return to court for trial to fight for their 
vindication, as they had stayed to fight the massive civil litigation filed 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and the others also have known they were targets of state and federal 
criminal investigations for a long time and would have fled the country by now 
if they had wanted to avoid prosecution, their attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
They also argued that the indictment contains no information about specific 
wrongdoing, alleging only violations of certain laws regarding the sale of 
American Continental debt securities at Lincoln offices to 20 people. The 
alleged crimes caused the victims to lose nearly $1.2 million, hardly serious 
enough to warrant such high bails, they contended. 
</P>
<P>
But Turley contended that the 20 people represented a much bigger group of 
investors who lost much more money, throwing in a new figure in the 
often-changing number of total victims. He said 17,458 small investors had 
bought $250 million in American Continental bonds at Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
He reminded the court of "one major distinction" between this case and other 
thrift fraud cases. "The victims are individuals deprived of their own 
particular finances," he said, not taxpayers asked to foot the bill for the 
entire thrift debacle, now estimated at $500 billion over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said that, though his office had no evidence that Keating would flee, 
"you can't escape the thought of Mr. Robert Vesco in a case like this." Vesco, 
a New Jersey financier indicted in 1972 for allegedly defrauding four firms out 
of $224 million, fled the country and remains at large.

<P>
In late 1985, Shirley Lampel was a woman in anguish. Her husband had just died, 
and years of suffering from diabetes had left her without sight in one eye and 
only limited vision in the other. 
</P>
<P>
The one ray of hope was financial. Her doting husband, Sy, an auto mechanic, 
had left a $30,000 life insurance policy. Prudently invested, it would help 
support her modest but comfortable life in Santa Maria, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Loan and Arizona 
home builder Charles H. Keating Jr., who had acquired the thrift the year 
before. As a result of what she thought was a rock-solid investment with 
Lincoln, her savings were devoured in what was to become one of the great 
financial fiascoes of American history - one that could eventually cost 
taxpayers about $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Lincoln gives a whole new definition to bank robbery," a bitter Lampel said 
recently. "It used to be that a person puts on a mask and goes in with a gun 
and robs a bank. Now we go into the bank and we get mugged. When did the bank 
become the crook?" 
</P>
<P>
amp;L's funds into huge tracts of raw land in 
Arizona, luxurious hotel projects, a portfolio of junk bonds and other 
speculative ventures, according to federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Now, federal and state investigators, regulators and lawmakers are poring over 
the details of Keating's activities. Already, regulators have filed a civil 
racketeering lawsuit accusing Keating and other Lincoln executives of 
squandering $1.1 billion in federally insured deposits through a series of 
"illegal, fraudulent and imprudent acts." The suit and other documents allege 
that Keating and his associates sought to evade regulatory restrictions on such 
investments by making bogus loans to "straw" property buyers. 
</P>
<P>
They also devised a tax plan that let them divert $95 million to Lincoln's 
parent company by creating "phantom" profits through sham land swaps and loans, 
the regulators allege, and used accounting gimmicks, legal maneuvering and 
political string-pulling to further their operations and slow down 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee decided last week to appoint an outside counsel to 
investigate Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other senators who accepted 
large campaign contributions from Keating and then intervened with regulators 
on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the ultimate cost to others, Keating and his associates sold about 
$200 million in now-worthless debt securities to unwary customers such as Mrs. 
Lampel at Lincoln's branch offices. Many of the purchasers were elderly 
Southern Californians who thought the securities - issued by Lincoln's parent 
company - were federally insured. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has repeatedly denied the government's charges. He has accused 
regulators of seeking revenge against him, harassing his employees and failing 
to understand real estate development. That, not his own actions, drove Lincoln 
to ruin, he says. 
</P>
<P>
As a longtime home builder and mortgage lender, he said, his operation always 
has concentrated on single-family housing. He simply turned Lincoln, an 
institution whose financial health was questionable when he bought it, from a 
mortgage lender into a company that prepared raw land for residential 
construction, and he had a number of projects successfully built, he 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the various government investigations ultimately disclose, it is 
already clear that Lincoln is one of the worst disasters in the nationwide 
savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Began as Lawyer 
</P>
<P>
Keating, a collegiate gold medal swimmer in the Pan American Games and a Navy 
fighter pilot in World War II, began his business career as a lawyer in 
Cincinnati. In a conservative business community that traced its antecedents to 
the days when the Ohio River was the key to settling the American heartland, 
Keating stood out as an aggressive risk-taker and a stubborn competitor. 
</P>
<P>
He was once described by his brother, William, as an "impatient" person who 
never worried about the popularity of his positions. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he showed an early taste for combining business with politics. In the 
political arena, he became a vociferous opponent of pornography, aiding 
prosecutions, lobbying elected officials. He was even appointed to a federal 
commission that studied pornography. 
</P>
<P>
And he managed his brother's successful congressional campaigns in 1970 and 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Keating pursued a career in real estate development that 
eventually made him a top executive in a firm owned by wealthy Cincinnati 
financier Carl H. Lindner, who specialized in making aggressive takeover bids 
for other companies. The close association they developed continued long after 
Keating left Cincinnati in 1976 to take over a foundering Lindner real estate 
development firm in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
A few years after moving West, Keating had his first serious brush with federal 
regulators. In 1979, Lindner and Keating consented to a Securities and Exchange 
Commission order prohibiting them from fraudulently diverting corporate assets 
to their personal use. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, Keating - riding the tide of explosive growth in the Sun 
Belt - had built the former Lindner construction firm, renamed American 
Continental Corp., into one of the nation's 10 biggest home builders. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he - like others - had noticed a new opportunity: Congress, trying 
to rescue a savings and loan industry saddled with traditional low-rate, 
long-term home mortgage loans in an era of soaring interest rates, was 
dismantling the web of federal regulations that had always circumscribed the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
amp;Ls were allowed to place a part of their 
assets in direct investments such as ownership interests in real estate 
projects and other ventures, instead of just making loans on which they would 
collect interest. They were also allowed to place customer funds in high-yield, 
high-risk "junk" bonds and other non-traditional investments. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L investments. The capital requirement for banks was twice as high: $6 
for every $100 in assets. 
</P>
<P>
California was an especially tempting target for such takeovers. In an effort 
to prevent state-chartered savings and loans from converting to federal 
institutions, California had enacted an even more liberal deregulation law than 
the federal government. In 1983, the state allowed thrifts to put 100% of their 
money into direct investments. 
</P>
<P>
From his headquarters in Phoenix, Keating spotted a California thrift that 
seemed ideal for his expanding purposes. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Loan was an Orange County thrift that had experienced 
losses in the early 1980s, but it had returned to profitability by the end of 
1983. Keating bought it in February, 1984, for $51 million. At the time, 
regulators say, they were assured that Lincoln's previous management and 
lending policies would be retained. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Keating transformed the traditional mortgage lender into a 
post-deregulation dynamo. Indeed, he said he bought Lincoln to take full 
advantage of California's deregulation law. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L's traditional 
areas of business and began seeking bigger profits from riskier strategies: 
</P>
<P>
 - He used Lincoln's deposits to buy huge tracts of undeveloped Arizona desert 
in an effort to create shining new communities from dust. The most ambitious of 
those projects was Estrella, a 20,000-acre planned community 20 miles southwest 
of Phoenix that was to include 50,000 homes for 200,000 residents as well as 
retail, industrial and office space. 
</P>
<P>
 - He assembled parcels of land in the affluent Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale 
to build a $296-million luxury resort hotel called the Phoenician Resort. He 
also bought the Hotel Pontchartrain, a troubled hotel in downtown Detroit, and 
initiated elaborate renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 - He used Lincoln funds to buy junk bonds and dabble in foreign currency 
trading. He bought big blocks of stock in other companies, prompting 
speculation that he might be a budding corporate raider. 
</P>
<P>
He even sold the home-building unit of American Continental as he created a 
complex organization with 55 subsidiaries primarily devoted to real estate 
investment and development. 
</P>
<P>
Efficacy in Doubt 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, some were beginning to question the efficacy of the 
government's prescription for the ailing thrift industry. Edwin J. Gray, whose 
position as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board made him the nation's 
top savings and loan regulator, was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
amp;Ls were using their customers' money to acquire 
stakes in windmill farms, restaurants and a host of other businesses they knew 
little about. Such investments, far from returning the industry to health, were 
bringing new losses so huge they threatened the solvency of the federal deposit 
insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
amp;Ls such as Lincoln, 
to limit direct investments to 10% of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L game and already the rules were changing. Arguing that Gray's proposed 
restriction would destroy the industry, Keating began lobbying hard against it. 
</P>
<P>
He hired Alan Greenspan, a respected economist who had served as a senior 
official in the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations and now 
heads the Federal Reserve Board, to analyze the proposed rule. Greenspan 
produced a report opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
Although executives at other savings and loans also lobbied against the direct 
investment rule, Keating was perhaps the most prominent and persistent 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Keating arranged for a congressional resolution that called on Gray to delay 
implementing the investment restriction for six months. Although 225 House 
members signed the resolution, it failed to sway the regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to stop the restriction, Keating found a way to blunt its impact on 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The Gray rule would be adopted in early 1985, Keating learned, but would be 
applied retroactively to Dec. 10, 1984; any direct investments made before that 
date would be permitted to stand, even if they exceeded the 10% limit. 
</P>
<P>
Three days before the expected deadline, Lincoln won approval from the 
California Department of Savings and Loan to move an additional $800 million 
into direct investments. That increased Lincoln's direct investments to about 
40% of its $2.2 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Customers Targeted 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Keating and his executives came up with an innovative way to raise 
unrestricted funds for American Continental: They would sell debt securities 
similar to the bonds issued by most of America's major corporations. But, 
instead of selling them through Wall Street brokerages and other investment 
firms, they would peddle the securities to Lincoln customers. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Corporations routinely approved American 
Continental's first request to sell the debt securities, called subordinated 
debentures. About the same time, the state Department of Savings and Loan 
allowed American Continental to set up desks in the lobbies of Lincoln's 29 
branches to sell the securities. 
</P>
<P>
Although the securities were, in effect, junk bonds, Keating said he would have 
recommended them to anyone, even to the Roman Catholic charities he supported 
heavily with donations. In fact, the Sisters of Charity in Cincinnati bought 
$444,000 of the securities. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1988, American Continental sought approval for a second debenture 
offering. The California Department of Corporations approved the sales, even 
though the agency's own staff and the state's top savings and loan regulators 
expressed concern about the company's financial condition and ability to repay 
the debt. 
</P>
<P>
In little more than two years, American Continental sold about $200 million 
worth of debt securities to nearly 22,000 investors. About two-thirds of them 
were elderly Southern Californians who bought them at Lincoln branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them have said in lawsuits and congressional testimony that they were 
persuaded to buy the securities instead of certificates of deposit by American 
Continental sales representatives, who assured them that the securities were 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
Some have said they thought that the debentures were backed by federal deposit 
insurance - a costly mistake, as things turned out. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators Cool 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, federal regulators in the regional office in San Francisco were 
becoming distinctly unsympathetic to Keating's operations. They began a 
detailed audit of Lincoln's books that stretched over a full year - far longer 
than such examinations normally take. They concluded that Keating was handling 
Lincoln in an unsafe and unsound manner. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, examiners reported that Lincoln had made a substantial number of 
loans without proper appraisals, without verification of borrowers' credit and 
even, in some cases, without a loan application. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, the examiners said in their reports, it appeared that 
Lincoln was making bogus loans in an effort to get around the new restrictions 
on direct investments in real estate and to record profits that it had not 
really earned. 
</P>
<P>
Many major loans were made to "straw" buyers: people who bought properties with 
Lincoln funds on favorable terms and who never intended to repay the loans, 
thus leaving the savings and loan in control of the properties, the regulatory 
reports allege. 
</P>
<P>
The examiners said that, after making the loans, Lincoln claimed as profits the 
up-front fees and interest such loans normally generate. However, in many cases 
Lincoln had also provided the money for the fees and interest in addition to 
financing the entire purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, the examiners recommended to their superiors in Washington that 
the government seize the institution or at least impose a restrictive order to 
curtail its high-flying operations. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L's development-oriented business. Regulators 
insisted, for instance, on using standards that applied to single-family loans 
to evaluate Lincoln's commercial loans. The thrift had obtained audited 
financial statements from the borrowers, and those documents provided a better 
picture of possible risks than a consumer credit report, they said. 
</P>
<P>
They contended also that regulators made simple mathematical errors in 
computing such items as how much Lincoln should set aside in reserves to 
protect against possible losses. 
</P>
<P>
The big loans were made to borrowers who came up with 25% down payments, 
company executives said. Lincoln did not finance 100% of the purchase price, 
they said, and any other loans that the buyers obtained were not for the 
purpose of providing the down payments. Lincoln, they said, was entitled to 
record the profits on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of the regional regulators were not adopted by Gray or M. 
Danny Wall, who replaced Gray as head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 
July, 1987. Wall, a former staff aide to the Senate Banking Committee, said 
that there was insufficient evidence to justify the extreme action proposed by 
the San Francisco overseers. 
</P>
<P>
If the rebuff angered the regional examiners, what came next stunned them. A 
year later, Wall stripped them of their supervisory responsibility for Lincoln 
and transferred jurisdiction to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said an internal investigation had determined that substantial animosity 
had developed between Lincoln and the San Francisco regulators and that leaks 
of confidential financial information had damaged the savings and loan. Wall 
ordered a new examination directed by Washington-based regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of absolving Lincoln, however, the new audit reached even more damaging 
conclusions. Among other things, it called into question the tax-sharing plan 
Lincoln and its accountants had devised in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As a subsidiary of American Continental, Lincoln did not deal directly with the 
Internal Revenue Service on taxes. Instead, American Continental collected 
money from all its subsidiaries, then filed a consolidated tax return and made 
tax payments to the IRS on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Over a period of a little more than two years, Lincoln made $95 million in 
tax-sharing payments to its parent company, ostensibly to cover taxes on 
profits it had earned. 
</P>
<P>
But the government alleges in its racketeering lawsuit and other documents that 
Lincoln did not owe $95 million in taxes at the time and that American 
Continental never paid any of that money to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and his subordinates engaged in a series of sham transactions designed 
to create the appearance of higher profits, and thus higher tax obligations, as 
a device for siphoning money out of Lincoln and moving it to American 
Continental, which kept the extra funds, according to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Higher profits also boosted American Continental's stock price. That in turn 
helped Keating and his family collect $34 million over five years from 
salaries, gains on stock sales and other benefits, regulatory records state. 
The stock sales were made to American Continental's employee stock ownership 
plan, which obtained loans guaranteed by Lincoln to acquire the shares. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln executives said they did not misuse the tax-sharing arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The executives contend the transactions that generated the profits were 
legitimate and that Lincoln owed taxes, although they acknowledged that the 
taxes might not have been due immediately. 
</P>
<P>
And, although Lincoln owed the taxes as a separate entity, they said, American 
Continental could use $250 million in tax credits it had accumulated itself to 
offset any profits on a consolidated basis that it or its subsidiaries made. 
Meantime, executives argued, the parent company could invest Lincoln's tax 
payments any way it chose. 
</P>
<P>
The tax plan was reviewed and approved by regulators, they pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
They sold stock to the employee stock ownership plan, the executives said, 
because the plan, by its very nature, required the purchase of American 
Continental stock. 
</P>
<P>
Because the stock was thinly traded, the plan could not acquire the big blocks 
of stock it needed except through sales by insiders. They said also that the 
price the insiders received for their stock was slightly below prevailing 
market prices. 
</P>
<P>
And any allegations of boosting stock prices to get money out of the employee 
stock ownership plan through the sales, they said, fall flat because most of 
such stock purchases occurred in 1985, long before the allegedly fraudulent 
transactions occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Example Cited 
</P>
<P>
One example of how Lincoln conducted its business, according to government 
regulators, is a loan it made to Ernest C. Garcia, a Phoenix-area developer. 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1987, Garcia approached Lincoln to see if he could borrow money to buy 
the remaining stock in a company in which he already held a 20% interest. 
Lincoln executives agreed to make the loan, regulators allege, but there was a 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
According to the government's racketeering lawsuit, the following events 
occurred: 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of lending him the money he wanted, Lincoln asked Garcia to buy 
1,000 acres of land owned by a Lincoln subsidiary for $14 million. The 1,000 
acres were part of an 8,500-acre tract called Hidden Valley Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Investment Corp. to buy the 
1,000 acres instead. Lincoln agreed to the arrangement and lent Westcon $10.5 
million, or 75% of the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lincoln lent Garcia $20.2 million, and Garcia lent $3.5 
million of that amount to Westcon. The $3.5 million was used by Westcon to make 
the 25% cash down payment on the land purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln recorded an $11-million profit on the transaction, even though the only 
cash it received was $3.5 million that had come out of its own coffers, the 
suit contends. Westcon has never made a payment on its $10.5-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
In a May, 1988, letter, Westcon acknowledged that it had acted as Garcia's 
nominee and asked him to "arrange for the transfer of this property to its 
rightful owner as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
That transaction was the first of 10 involving Hidden Valley Ranch property. 
The government alleges that, altogether, Lincoln claimed "phantom profits" of 
$82 million from the 10 deals. Those profits resulted in Lincoln's making $31 
million in tax-sharing payments to its parent company. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental executives rejected the government's characterization of 
the Hidden Valley loans. They said that Garcia, for instance, obtained a 
$30-million line of credit and that the $20.2 million he borrowed on the line 
was wired directly to the Tucson Electric Power Co., which owned 80% of the 
company Garcia had founded in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Hidden Valley deal, they said, was not a condition for obtaining the line 
of credit, and Garcia, a major developer, used his own funds to lend Westcon 
the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Senators Intervene 
</P>
<P>
It was during this period that one of the most controversial episodes in the 
Lincoln case occurred. In his struggle against the regulators, Keating enlisted 
the aid of five U.S. senators, who intervened on his behalf in two 
now-controversial meetings with thrift regulators in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The five senators - Cranston, Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) - had 
received more than $300,000 in campaign contributions from Keating, his family 
and his business associates. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cranston solicited $850,000 from Keating for three voter 
registration groups that signed up primarily Democrats. Glenn solicited 
$200,000 for a political organization he controlled. And McCain's wife and her 
father invested nearly $360,000 in a 1986 Keating partnership that put up a 
Phoenix shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The first meeting, on April 2, 1987, involved bank board Chairman Gray and 
Sens. DeConcini, Glenn, McCain and Cranston. Gray later stated publicly that 
the four senators tried to make a deal for Keating by promising to get Lincoln 
to make more traditional home mortgages again if Gray would rescind the 10% 
limit on Lincoln's direct investments. 
</P>
<P>
Their effort, Gray declared, was an "abuse of senatorial authority" and 
"tantamount to an attempt to subvert" the regulatory process. 
</P>
<P>
The senators heatedly deny proposing any such deal. They say they met with Gray 
to discuss the unusually lengthy audit of Lincoln by the San Francisco regional 
office; their only message, the four senators say, was that the regulators 
should charge Keating with something or get off his back. 
</P>
<P>
The second meeting occurred a week later. Riegle joined the other four in a 
session with regional regulators who were conducting the protracted examination 
of Lincoln. Minutes of the meeting show that DeConcini mentioned the direct 
investment rule, but there was no subsequent discussion of the issue. The 
minutes indicate also that the session ended abruptly when the regulators said 
they intended to refer the Lincoln case to the Justice Department for criminal 
prosecution. That investigation is now under way. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether a deal over the 10% rule was ever discussed, critics of 
the senators' actions suggest that their involvement may have delayed the 
ultimate seizure of Lincoln by two years, adding at least $1 billion to the 
taxpayers' bill for bailing out the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the Senate Ethics Committee decided to appoint an outside 
counsel to investigate whether the five senators violated ethics rules by going 
to bat for Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, meanwhile, filed a formal response to the committee contending that 
he had done nothing illegal or improper in connection with Keating. He said his 
efforts on Lincoln's behalf never went beyond what a member of Congress can 
legally do for a constituent who is experiencing problems with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston denied that his actions were in any way responsible for the losses 
facing the government or the people who bought the American Continental debt 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Bright Projections 
</P>
<P>
And what of Keating's enormous bets on the future of Arizona real estate? 
</P>
<P>
In brochures for Estrella, his big planned community southwest of Phoenix, 
Keating boasted that Phoenix would soon become the 12th-largest metropolitan 
area in the country. Employment was rising at an annual rate of nearly 4% as 
new residents flocked to the Grand Canyon state, and the future seemed as 
bright as the desert sun. 
</P>
<P>
A Lincoln subsidiary put in miles of sidewalks, created two lakes and made 
other improvements at Estrella. Some businesses began to move in. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Keating poured a total of $296 million into the Phoenician Resort in 
Scottsdale, which was designed to attract the affluent tourists who had been 
streaming into the state in increasing numbers every winter. 
</P>
<P>
Then things went bad. The influx of new residents and businesses to Arizona 
began to slow, but developers kept right on developing. Before long, the state 
was vastly overbuilt. The residential real estate market went flat. The 
commercial market fell through the floor. Even the tourist trade dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Estrella bears little resemblance to Keating's predictions; much of the 
land is still largely undeveloped. The Phoenician opened in late 1988, and, 
although it is generating tremendous income - $4.3 million last month alone - 
it is not generating enough to pay off its construction debt, regulators claim. 
</P>
<P>
"Lincoln never was a viable institution under Keating," said Bert Ely, an 
Alexandria, Va.-based consultant to the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, government regulators seized control of the Phoenician and another 
Lincoln property, the Crescent Hotel in Phoenix, ousting Keating and as many as 
30 of his associates from management of the lodges. 
</P>
<P>
Seizure Occurs 
</P>
<P>
The government finally seized Lincoln on April 14, 1989, declaring that it was 
being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner and that Keating and his 
executives were dissipating its assets. 
</P>
<P>
The day before Lincoln was seized, American Continental filed for protection 
from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix. The bankruptcy case 
prevented regulators from assuming full control of some of Lincoln's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it created an unusual group of victims. Lincoln's regular depositors 
would be made whole by taxpayers through the federal deposit insurance program, 
but the 22,000 investors who had bought the American Continental debt 
securities were left holding worthless paper. There was no federal insurance 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
One of those investors was Shirley Lampel. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Lampel's husband had died of a heart attack at the age of 58. Despite 
her inability to work because of the diabetes that had left her all but blind, 
Lampel sought no pity. With Social Security payments and the monthly income 
from her husband's $30,000 life insurance proceeds, she would make it. 
</P>
<P>
One day, after moving from Santa Maria to Tustin, she had noticed a large 
newspaper advertisement about an investment opportunity being offered at a 
Lincoln office near her condominium. She took her life insurance proceeds and 
"practically beat down the door" at the Lincoln branch to buy American 
Continental debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
After being assured that Lincoln was safe and sound, she had signed two pieces 
of paper and handed over a $30,000 cashier's check. She could not read the fine 
print, and she said no one ever read the documents to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was buying something similar to a certificate of deposit," she 
said. "I didn't know what debentures were. You have home insurance and car 
insurance, but do most of us really understand all that stuff? No. We trust."

VAST INVESTMENT IN STATE POLITICS BY KEATING TOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr., his family and his 
business empire poured nearly $350,000 into state politics during 1985 and 
1986, with about half of it going to Gov. George Deukmejian's reelection 
campaign, contribution records show. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the $173,000 donated to Deukmejian's campaign, Keating's family and 
business connections also contributed $176,500 over the two years to Democratic 
and Republican groups and such politicians as then-Assembly Republican Leader 
Pat Nolan of Glendale and Gray Davis in his successful race for state 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
The figures do not include at least $83,336 in contributions made personally or 
through the firms of two other Keating associates - Los Angeles attorney Karl 
M. Samuelian and San Diego businessman Tom C. Stickel. 
</P>
<P>
Keating hired Samuelian, the governor's chief fund raiser, to be one of his 
California attorneys. He also invested heavily in a San Diego company 
controlled by Stickel, who also was a Deukmejian fund raiser and became the 
Republican Party's finance co-chairman in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie Keating's political reach, in retrospect, was phenomenal," Stickel 
said in a recent interview about Keating's political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
The political largess in Sacramento was part of a web of influence that the 
blunt-talking Arizona businessman wove throughout the country to nurture and 
protect his ill-fated financial and investment companies, which regulators now 
contend inflated the value of their assets and deceived investors into buying 
high-risk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Loan. The move is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion - the 
costliest savings and loan bailout in American history. 
</P>
<P>
After the seizure, the outspoken Keating candidly declared that he had expected 
the political contributions to prod influential politicians, such as U.S. Sen. 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), to fend off hostile regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my 
financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my 
cause," said Keating. "I want to say in the most forceful way I can, I 
certainly hope so." 
</P>
<P>
In California, Keating hired key Deukmejian supporters or appointees to help 
protect his ill-fated Lincoln Savings. As attorneys, he hired fund raiser 
Samuelian and Franklin Tom, a former state commissioner of savings and loan who 
left public service to join Samuelian's Los Angeles law firm. The lawyers 
helped Keating obtain state permission to float more than $200 million in 
high-risk bonds, on which his company subsequently defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
Keating also paid $200,000 in 1985 for the consulting services of former 
Savings and Loan Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart, who had left government 
service in December, 1984, for a job with TCS Enterprises of San Diego. Days 
before he left for TCS, Taggart approved a request by Lincoln to increase the 
amount of assets the institution could sink into high-risk real estate 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1985, when Taggart joined TCS, Keating hired him as an executive 
and paid $2.89 million to buy 19.2% of the fledgling San Diego firm's stock as 
it went public. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Keating and his associates were investing heavily in California 
state politics. His coalition of contributors included his family - son 
Charles Keating III and three sons-in-law - and his corporations, including 
American Continental, Lincoln Savings and three other subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The group also included eight employees and executives, such as American 
Continental Vice President Robert J. Kielty and consultant Taggart, as well as 
Phoenix business associate Conley Wolfs-winkel, who bought 6,150 acres in 
Tucson with American Continental in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
While Keating himself gave only $7,000 - all of it to Deukmejian - the 
coalition of his relatives, business interests and associates brought total 
donations to $349,500 in 1985 and 1986. Reports show: 
</P>
<P>
* Deukmejian received $173,000 from the Arizona businessman and his associates. 
The governor received $80,000 directly from American Continental and Lincoln 
Savings; $19,000 from Keating and his family members; $51,000 from other 
American Continental subsidiaries and executives; and $23,000 from Keating 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has said that he met Keating only once and never knew of Lincoln's 
financial woes until he read about them in newspaper reports this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Keating and associates gave $176,500 to other state political organizations 
and politicians. They gave $7,500 to the California Republican Party, $50,000 
to the League of Conservative Voters, $17,000 to then-Assemblyman Davis' 
campaign for state controller, and $85,000 to the state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
They also gave $17,000 to four legislators - Nolan, who authored the law 
deregulating the savings and loan industry in 1982; Assembly Rules Committee 
Chairman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys); Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), and 
Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos). 
</P>
<P>
* Stickel and TCS contributed $50,666 in money, staff time and office space to 
Deukmejian and the Republican Party. Samuelian and his law partners gave 
$32,700.

THRIFT OWNER CALLED A 'CON MAN'; 
S&#60;amp;LS: STATE THRIFTS CHIEF SPEAKS BLUNTLY ABOUT CHARLES H. KEATING BEFORE AN 
ASSEMBLY PANEL. GOVERNOR'S FUND-RAISER DEFENDS HIS ACTIONS AS ONE OF THE 
BUSINESSMAN'S ATTORNEYS. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SACRAMENTO 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. was a "con man" who 
relied on lies and political influence - "juice" - to fool and bully 
regulators in charge of his ill-fated Irvine-based thrift, California Savings 
and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford told an Assembly committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also heard Gov. George Deukmejian's top campaign fund-raiser, Los 
Angeles attorney Karl M. Samuelian, defend his actions as one of Keating's 
attorneys, hired to represent the Arizona businessman's interests before state 
regulators. Samuelian said he recommended the appointment of two successive 
state corporations commissioners - both of whom subsequently approved the 
sales of high-risk junk bonds by Lincoln's parent corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian, Deukmejian's campaign finance chairman since 1982, also said that he 
represented Keating at several meetings with state regulators. After the 
hearing, Samuelian told reporters that he helped set up meetings between 
Keating and the regulators' boss, Business, Transportation and Housing 
Secretary John K. Geoghegan. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Crawford's blunt remarks about Keating's tactics and demeanor that 
provided the most provocative testimony Wednesday before the Assembly's Finance 
and Insurance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for a simple explanation of why Lincoln Savings failed, prompting a 
federal takeover in April that could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, 
Crawford said: "If I had to pick one reason, I would have to say that probably 
the owner was a con man. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a dominant person who believed that he was above the law and 
regulations, that he was powerful and he had the juice and he could win. He 
could fight the regulators, and he did a very good job of it." 
</P>
<P>
When Keating first took over Lincoln in February, 1984, he told state 
regulators one thing but all along planned to do another, Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were going to run a traditional savings and loan. They lied to 
us," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Crawford said, Keating used Lincoln's citizen deposits and sales of 
high-risk bonds as sources of cash for marginal land acquisitions in Arizona, 
Colorado, Texas and Louisiana. Crawford said that when he took over the 
department in 1985, he found that his predecessor had allowed Keating to keep 
the original records of Lincoln Savings in Phoenix, leaving only incomplete 
copies of documents for California regulators in the Lincoln offices in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said he ordered Lincoln's files to be brought back to California after 
he discovered Keating had contributed $50,000 to Arizona's attorney general in 
an uncontested race - a move that persuaded him that any action by California 
regulators would be resisted by their counterparts in Arizona. He also said 
regulators needed the centralized files to help keep up with Keating's 
financial empire, which expanded from 32 corporations in 1984 to 54 entities by 
the end of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"That was 54 places to hide the smoking gun," said Crawford, who added: "We 
were never on top of the problems of Lincoln Savings. . . . They could write up 
(the value of) their assets faster than you could write them down." 
</P>
<P>
He said the task was made even more difficult by the phalanx of Keating 
employees and attorneys, who overwhelmed understaffed regulators. Crawford said 
he tried to keep tabs of Lincoln with only one experienced examiner and two 
trainees. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Lincoln and American Continental) had a battery of people. They had 48 
CPAs, they had 15 attorneys on staff. I just lately learned they employed 77 
outside law firms," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a Home Loan Bank Board memo that said Keating had attempted to 
have him fired, Crawford said he did not know of any such effort but added that 
he, like federal regulators, felt "beat up" by the Arizona businessman. 
</P>
<P>
'Proof of the Pudding' 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that no one from Deukmejian's office tried to influence his 
handling of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the juice (but) he didn't have it on a direct line from the governor to 
me. I'm still here, and that's proof of the pudding, I think," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), expressed 
concern about allegations that Keating and his associates used political 
connections to influence state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Keating was invited to attend the committee hearing but did not respond, 
Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian fund-raiser Samuelian, however, said he has never contacted the 
governor on behalf of any client. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the governor is concerned, I have religiously for 10 years separated 
my business matters from my (campaign) assistance to the governor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian outlined 1986 and 1987 contributions to Deukmejian's campaign 
committee from Keating's companies, relatives and business associates totaling 
$150,000, plus an additional $100,000 to Republican fund-raising efforts in 
California that Samuelian collected. 
</P>
<P>
However, he denied ever "lobbying" for Keating or his companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We were representing a client as a lawyer, not doing any lobbying work," 
Samuelian said. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Samuelian said he helped set up Keating's meetings in 
February and March, 1988, with Transportation and Housing Secretary Geoghegan, 
a Deukmejian appointee whose agency oversees the state's savings and loan and 
corporations regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian also revealed to the committee Wednesday that he had recommended that 
Deukmejian appoint two former law associates, Franklin Tom and Christine W. 
Bender, as corporation commissioners. The governor named Tom first, and then 
Bender succeeded him. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tom and Bender approved the sale of controversial high-risk bonds issued 
by American Continental and sold through Lincoln's branches. 
</P>
<P>
After Tom left his post as commissioner, he rejoined Samuelian's law firm and 
represented Keating's position in meetings with Bender, his successor and 
former deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Wording Deleted 
</P>
<P>
Also during the hearing, state savings and loan examiner Richard Newsom said 
the state attorney general's office deleted wording in a December, 1988, 
cease-and-desist order against American Continental that could have warned 
investors not to buy the company's high-risk junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Newsom said the wording would have been the "atomic bomb" to end the junk bond 
sales, which continued through early 1989. But, he added, the attorney general 
balked at including the language because his office lacked the expertise to 
defend the state on a court challenge over securities matters. 
</P>
<P>
However, Newsom's testimony was immediately refuted by both Atty. Gen. John K. 
Van de Kamp and an attorney for the Savings and Loan Department. The attorney, 
Shirley Thayer, said she and others in the department made the decision to drop 
the language, not Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President 
Bush had no immediate plans to oust M. Danny Wall, the embattled chairman of 
the office of thrift supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who previously headed the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, is under fire for 
not acting on a recommendation by regional regulators to seize Lincoln in 1987. 
The government did not take control of the thrift until last April, and critics 
contend that the delay greatly increased the eventual cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press briefing if the White House planned to fire Wall, Fitzwater 
replied: "No, there's been no consideration of Mr. Wall's tenure. He's serving 
on the (office of thrift supervision) board, and there's been no change." 
</P>
<P>
Calls for Wall's resignation have increased in recent days. On Wednesday, three 
nonprofit organizations - the National Taxpayers Union, Public Citizen and 
Citizens Against Government - sent a letter to Bush urging him to oust Wall.

EX-KEATING AIDE TELLS OF CRANSTON BIDS FOR FUNDS; 
THRIFTS: THE FORMER LINCOLN S&#60;amp;L LOBBYIST TESTIFIES THE SENATOR SOUGHT 
CONTRIBUTIONS AT THE SAME TIME HE PROMISED TO ASSIST IN BATTLING REGULATORS. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. 
said Friday that moments after he first met Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) at a 
political event in 1984, the senator suggested Keating should contribute to his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
James Grogan also told the Senate Ethics Committee he remembers more than one 
occasion on which Cranston or his aides sought contributions from Keating while 
at the same time promising to assist Lincoln in its battle against federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has acknowledged only one such conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan, a surprise witness who testified under a limited grant of immunity from 
prosecution, said there was never a trade-off between Keating's contributions 
and his request for assistance. But he appeared to strengthen the committee's 
case against both Cranston and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). He provided 
important new details of Cranston's close alliance with Keating and 
contradicted earlier testimony by Cranston aides Joy Jacobson and Carolyn D. 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is investigating charges that Cranston, Riegle and three others - 
Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) 
- improperly assisted Keating in exchange for contributions. Their 
intervention with federal regulators allegedly delayed the government takeover 
of Lincoln, contributing to losses of $2 billion by the federally insured 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan, 36, who was paid $300,000 a year to lobby for Lincoln, recalled that he 
introduced himself to Cranston at an event in 1984, explaining that he worked 
for an Arizona builder who had just purchased a savings and loan in California. 
</P>
<P>
He said Cranston promptly pulled a 3x5 card from his pocket, saying: "I've been 
very good to the savings and loans. I've worked hard for California savings and 
loans. You all should really support me." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston then wrote Grogan's name and telephone number on the card, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, according to Grogan, he received a telephone call from 
Jacobson, the senator's fund-raiser. He said she repeated Cranston's contention 
that he had been "very supportive" of California thrifts and asked him if 
Keating would raise money for the senator. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan indicated he was surprised by this aggressive appeal for money because 
Keating is a conservative Republican who opposes abortion, and Cranston is a 
liberal Democrat who is an abortion rights advocate. As a result, he said, he 
did not immediately commit Keating to anything during his first conversation 
with Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
He said he later persuaded Keating to assist Cranston by telling him that the 
senator shared his negative opinion of then-Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
Chairman Edwin J. Gray. Keating disagreed with Gray's policies and later 
accused the bank board chairman of carrying on a "vendetta" against Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1985, as a result of Cranston's appeal for funds, Keating collected 
$15,000 in checks from his employees for the California senator. It was the 
first of nearly $1 million that Cranston solicited from Keating - $60,000 for 
his campaigns, $85,000 for the California Democratic Party and $850,000 for 
voter registration groups founded by the senator. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Grogan emphasized that Keating did not always have Cranston's 
support for his proposals. He said contributions could buy him access to a 
senator, but the money provided no guarantee that the senator would do the 
bidding of a contributor. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," he told the committee, "Sen. Cranston, whom I believe we gave 
the most money to, there were several times specifically when I went to his 
office and asked him, on behalf of Mr. Keating, to take action. And he said, 
'No, I can't do it.' And this was after tremendous amounts of money had been 
raised for him." 
</P>
<P>
Grogan contradicted earlier testimony by Jacobson, who said that she - not 
Cranston - was approached at the 1984 Democratic National Convention by 
Grogan, who "offered to be helpful to the reelection campaign." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Keating, who eventually developed a warm friendship with Cranston, 
usually waited until the end of his meetings with the senator to discuss 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
As Grogan explained it: "Normally as we were leaving, either Mr. Keating would 
say, 'Is there any way I can help you, senator? I appreciate our relationship.' 
Or at times, Sen. Cranston would say, 'Could you help in this area, could you 
help raise money here, could you do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
He added: "There was never an occasion where Mr. Keating asked Sen. Cranston to 
do something, and Sen. Cranston said, 'Only if you raise funds for me.' There 
was never an occasion where Mr. Keating said, 'If you do this for me, I will 
raise X-amount of dollars for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by special counsel Robert S. Bennett, Grogan detailed the 
following occasions on which he said Cranston or his aides allegedly sought 
contributions while at the same time pledging to assist Keating with 
regulators: 
</P>
<P>
 - In late 1986, when the Senate was considering legislation that would have 
imposed restraints on Keating's management of Lincoln, Grogan tried to contact 
Jordan, Cranston's aide on the Banking Committee, for assistance in battling 
the proposal. Unable to reach Jordan, he instead talked to Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
When Jacobson called back an hour later to report that she had told Jordan of 
Keating's opposition, she then said she wanted to "switch gears" and discuss 
something "totally unrelated." She asked him whether Cranston could get a 
personal loan for his reelection campaign from Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Cranston's campaign subsequently received a $300,000 line of 
credit from Lincoln that he never used. 
</P>
<P>
 - In September, 1987, Grogan personally delivered two checks totaling 
$250,000 for voter registration to Cranston in his office in the Capitol. "Mr. 
Keating wanted me to give you those checks," he told the senator. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan and Cranston then discussed Lincoln's problems, with Keating joining the 
conversation over the office speaker phone. Keating asked Cranston to contact 
then-bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall on Lincoln's behalf, and the senator 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 - In January, 1988, Grogan, Keating, Cranston, Cranston's son, Kim, and Kim's 
then-girlfriend, actress Shelley Duvall, had dinner together at Jimmy's 
restaurant in Los Angeles. Kim explained the work of Cranston's voter 
registration groups, one of which he headed, and Cranston offered to make two 
telephone calls suggested by Keating. In one call, Cranston arranged a meeting 
for Keating with Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has previously acknowledged that both contributions and assistance for 
Lincoln were discussed at the dinner. Grogan could not remember any discussion 
of specific amounts of money that Keating would contribute to the voter 
registration effort. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan contradicted testimony by Jordan concerning a written statement she 
inserted into the Congressional Record on Cranston's behalf in 1987 that 
assisted Lincoln in a pending court suit against the bank board. Jordan told 
the committee she acted entirely on her own initiative, but Grogan said she was 
acting on his request. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan also contradicted Riegle's statement that he did not arrange meetings 
between the five senators and federal regulators in early April, 1987. These 
meetings have been a central focus of the so-called Keating Five case because 
the regulators alleged that they were asked improperly by the senators to go 
easy on Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was during Riegle's visit to Keating's headquarters in Phoenix in 
March, 1987, that the senator first proposed the idea of such meetings. He said 
he later learned that Riegle had contacted Gray, who consented to meet with the 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan said Riegle, who was in line to become chairman of the Senate Banking 
Committee, had also insisted he himself could not attend such a meeting with 
the regulators unless he was invited by McCain and DeConcini, who represented 
the state where Keating lived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent to me . . . Sen. Riegle knew as a true politician that this 
was a potential politically explosive situation because there was so much media 
at the time about Mr. Keating and Mr. Gray fighting," he said.

  KEATING FOUND GUILTY ON 17 COUNTS OF FRAUD  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles H Keating Jr., the high-flying financier whose excesses came to
symbolize the collapse of the savings and loan industry, was found guilty
Wednesday of 17 counts of securities fraud.;   He faces up to a 10-year prison
sentence for his convictions by a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury and
will soon be indicted on federal charges, attorneys familiar with the case say.  
</P>
<P>
Keating's four-month Superior Court trial ended in guilty verdicts on
Wednesday, his 68th birthday. The jury found him guilty on 17 of 18 counts of
duping investors about the safety of junk bonds sold through Lincoln
branches.;   The land developer and financier, who donated $1.3 million to the
"Keating Five" senators and paid colossal salaries to relatives, never
flinched as the verdicts were read.;   Keating contends vindictive regulators
hounded him out of business. His lawyer said he would appeal the conviction.; 
The victims were among thousands of bondholders who lost $250 million when
Irvine-based Lincoln collapsed, the costliest thrift failure in history with a
bailout tab to taxpayers of $2.6 billion.;   Many elderly investors said they
were told Keating's bonds were safe, like insured certificates of deposit.;  
"We couldn't bring their money back, but we brought them a measure of
justice," said lead prosecutor William Hodgman.;   Jeri Mellon, the leader of
a bondholders support group, shouted "Justice! Justice!" after the verdict was
read.;   She said the group would now turn its efforts to a seemingly odd
goal: delaying the federal criminal case against Keating.;   Mellon said the
bondholders want a civil lawsuit in Tucson federal court heard before a
federal criminal case. The reason is simple: The civil action holds the
promise of recovering their losses from lawyers and accountants accused of
propping up Keating's crumbling empire.;   "A lot of our members are in their
80s and 90s," Mellon said. "We're talking to legislators, anybody who'll
listen, insisting that the (criminal) case be postponed.;   "We can't wait
another 2 1/2 years until they get to our trial.";   Several lawyers involved
in the Keating legal wars told the Associated Press that a federal indictment,
of Keating and probably four others, would be returned this month. Attorneys,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the indictment could come as early as
Dec. 12.;   A Los Angeles federal grand jury has spent more than two years
investigating Keating, his family and officers and directors of Lincoln and
its parent company, Phoenix's American Continental Corp. Keating was American
Continental's chairman and chief executive.;   Four former associates have
pleaded guilty to federal crimes and are cooperating with prosecutors in hopes
of light sentences.;   The federal prosecutors in Los Angeles, Alice Hill and
David Sklansky, declined to comment on when an indictment might come, as did
Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett in Washington.;   However, the topic
surfaced publicly Wednesday as prosecutor Hodgman and defense attorney Stephen
C. Neal addressed Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, who set sentencing for
Feb. 7 and rejected a Hodgman request to raise Keating's bail from $100,000 to
$1 million.;   "As Mr. Neal has indicated, there is the possibility of some
imminent action on the federal front," Hodgman said in arguing that Keating
was now an increased flight risk.;   Emotions ran high during the trial, which
became a national window into the extravagances and duplicity that contributed
to the collapse of the savings and loan industry during the freewheeling
1980s.;   Civil lawsuits contend that after buying Lincoln in 1984, American
Continental quickly and illegally began siphoning off federally insured
deposits to fund a playground of lofty salaries and company-paid jet-setting
for Keating, his family and top officers.;   During the trial, bondholders
jeered Keating as he passed them in court hallways. An elderly woman who lost
$4,900 on a junk bond gave him a shaking, demanding repayment. A comic swatted
him with a powdered wig, shouting, "This is for America.";   In addition to
the action to recover bondholder losses, the Tucson suit includes a $2.7
billion racketeering suit by the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency
that inherits failed thrifts.;   Other actions include an effort by the Office
of Thrift Supervision to recover $131 million allegedly looted from Lincoln by
Keating and his cronies, and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.;   At the trial, defense attorney Neal gambled by calling no
defense witnesses, saying prosecutors never showed Keating took part in or
even knew about any deceptions of bond buyers at Lincoln's Southern California
branches.;   Neal told jurors an innocent verdict would rebuke the regulators
Keating accuses of driving him into insolvency.;   But Joseph Cotchett, the
attorney for the bondholders in the civil suit, said the jurors sent another
message instead.;   "It's a tribute to the system, because the Keatings of the
world can buy a lot of people, including politicians. But they can't buy a
jury," Cotchett said.; WHO'S DOING TIME IN THE S

Loan Association offered the government an
unusual trade in the days after the feds seized the thrift
last April: We'll give you loan documents if you give us the
art in Lincoln's offices.
</P>
<P>
Charles Keating, the colorful chairman of Lincoln's parent
company, called this yet another "ridiculous" exaggeration of
the real story from incompetent regulators.
The takeover was "the most chaotic, incredible situation
I've been involved in," said regulator Keith Seibold. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Seibold, a 20-year veteran of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., has been in the first wave of regulators in many a
bank seizure.
</P>
<P>
Testifying in Mr. Keating's court challenge to the
takeover, Mr. Seibold said "lots of documents - loan and
credit files - were missing" when an FDIC team swept through
Lincoln's offices in Phoenix, Ariz., April 14, 1989. He said
that over the next several days, the FDIC managed to retrieve
the documents from Lincoln officials - in exchange for
giving the officials some of the art that decorated Lincoln's
offices.
</P>
<P>
Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin seemed incredulous.
</P>
<P>
"You don't actually mean pictures on the wall?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, your honor, pictures on the wall," Mr. Seibold replied.
</P>
<P>
But during a break in the trial, Mr. Keating said the
suggestion that there was any bartering to get documents back
was "ridiculous." He explained that Lincoln's files were
spread among two buildings used by Lincoln and by American
Continental Corp., the parent company.
</P>
<P>
In sorting out what belonged where after the takeover,
Lincoln's files were returned to Lincoln's building.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mr. Keating asked the regulators to return to him
a painting, which hung in Lincoln's offices and was given to
him by his nephew. Mr. Keating also said that Lincoln was
required to keep all original loan files at its headquarters
in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Seibold wouldn't speak to reporters about Mr.
</P>
<P>
Keating's version of the events.
</P>
<P>
A few blocks away on Capitol Hill, Rep. Henry Gonzalez,
who made Mr. Keating something of a celebrity with his
hearings on Lincoln last year, called for the Justice
Department to freeze the assets of Mr. Keating and other
"highflyers who have defrauded savings and loans."
Mr. Keating said Mr. Gonzalez was ignoring the "truth" of
regulatory iniquity that was evident from the trial. "He
prefers his kangaroo court," Mr. Keating said.

The suit in Los Angeles also charged Mr. Paul, the former
CenTrust chairman, with helping American Continental
improperly report a gain of $24.6 million on the sale of
securities during the second quarter of 1988.
