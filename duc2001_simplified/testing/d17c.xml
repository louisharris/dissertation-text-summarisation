Detector Checks For Brain Waves Of A Lie
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lie detector that measures brain waves would be
more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says
its developer.
``It would probably not falsely accuse any innocent people, and
it would probably pick up 70 to 90 percent of guilty people,'' says
J. Peter Rosenfeld, a Northwestern University professor of
psychology and of neurobiology and physiology. ``I think that's
better than existing units.''
The American Medical Association and the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment have said polygraphs are wrong 15 percent to
50 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeld's lie detector picks up brain-wave activity through
electrodes attached to the scalp, amplifying the signals and
feeding them into a computer, which coordinates the information and
displays it on a video screen.
``If sensory information has a special meaning for you ... then
your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the P3
wave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In tests at Northwestern, subjects have been asked to look at a
series of words, most with no special meaning. ``Occasionally,
they'll see a word that is meaningful, like some anti-social act
they're involved in _ cheating on tests or using drugs _ which is
sometimes the case here,'' Rosenfeld said.
``When they see terms like that, their brain waves break into P3
waves.''
Polygraphs measure the physical expression of emotions _ pulse,
sweating, blood pressure and breathing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Advertising researchers have measured P3 waves to better gauge
what consumers want instead of what they say they want, and
psychiatrists can detect certain disorders, such as attention
deficits, by measuring them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeld has worked on the detector for almost four years and
says it could be widely used within three more. He published a
study last year and will publish another this summer in the
International Journal of Neuroscience.
``It's a perfectly valid way of detecting lies,'' said Sidney
Weinstein, a professor of neurology at New York University College
of Medicine in New York City and editor of the Danbury, Conn.-based
neuroscience journal.
</P>
<P>
However, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times
as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would
need a great deal more training, Weinstein said.

Most Private Employers Will Be Barred From Using Lie Detector
Tests
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning in December, most private employers
will be barred by law from using polygraphs and other types of lie
detectors to screen job applicants or test the current employees
except in rare circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Under new regulations issued Friday by the Labor Department,
employers can be fined up to $10,000 for requiring a job seeker or
employee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph exam
for voice stress analysis.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, which take effect Dec. 27, implement
legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Reagan last
June outlawing about 85 percent of the current use of lie detector
tests.
</P>
<P>
The congressional Office of Technology Assessment had estimated
that 2 million polygraph examinations were conducted last year _ 90
percent of them by private employers.
</P>
<P>
Some 7.2 million employers nationwide will be required to put up
posters in December summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions and
outlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detector
test.
</P>
<P>
Fred Alvarez, assistant labor secretary for employment
standards, said the posters will be mailed out in the next three or
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the fines, anyone required to take the test in
violation of the new law can sue employers in federal and state
courts for relief, such as employment reinstatement, promotion and
any payment of lost wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
Exempted from protection under the ban are employees of federal,
state and local governments or of federal contractors engaged in
national security, intelligence or top secret activities.
</P>
<P>
Also exempted from the ban are prospective employees of armored
car, security alarm and security guard firms hired to protect
operations affecting health and safety, national security or money.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical concerns or companies manufacturing, distributing
or dispensing controlled substances also can require job applicants
to submit to a lie detector test, but only for those people who
would have direct access to the drugs.
</P>
<P>
Polygraphs still can be used by employers to investigate
specific incidents of theft, embezzlement or sabotage, but not a
persistent problem, such as recurring inventory shortages.
</P>
<P>
But any workers asked to submit to a polygraph exam under those
conditions must be given at least 48 hours advance notice and a
statement in advance telling them of their rights, including the
right to refuse the test or to terminate it at any time.
</P>
<P>
The pre-test statement also must explain the specific incident
or activity being investigated and the basis for the employer's
suspicion that the person asked to take the exam was involved in it.
</P>
<P>
Results of a polygraph test or refusal to submit to such an exam
cannot be used alone as a basis for taking any action against an
employee. The regulations also forbid disclosure of the test
results to anyone other than the employee without the employee's
consent or a court order.

Workers Now Have Protection Against Random Use of Polygraphs
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you go on a job interview today and are
asked to take a lie detector test, the chances are you would be the
victim of an illegal act.
</P>
<P>
The same situation applies if your boss has a polygraph examiner
come into the warehouse tomorrow to hook wires to randomly selected
employees and question them about merchandise missing from the
company's shelves.
</P>
<P>
It is now illegal across America for most employers in interstate
commerce to use the controversial polygraph for pre-employment
screening purposes or to use them randomly against workers already
on their payroll.
</P>
<P>
These restrictions on lie detectors, whose accuracy has long been
under attack, are enumerated in a federal law that took effect
Tuesday, six months after it was signed by President Reagan.
``This is a holiday gift for working people,'' said Judy
Goldberg, legislative representative for the American Civil
Liberties Union.
``We expect that the new law will ban 80 percent of the
approximately 2 million polygraph tests given annually,'' Goldberg
said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
The law's restrictions will be felt most heavily in 28 states
that lack their own statutes restricting the use of lie detectors,
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
Not covered by the new rules, however, are federal, state and
local governments and firms doing sensitive work under contract to
the Defense Department, FBI and CIA.
</P>
<P>
The only other private-sector exceptions to the general ban apply
to companies that manufacture, distribute or dispense controlled
substances and some types of firms in the security guard, armored
car or security alarm fields.
</P>
<P>
The law prohibits an employee from being fired, disciplined or
discriminated against solely for refusing to submit to a polygraph
examination.
</P>
<P>
An employer can request an employee to take a lie detector test
if the worker had access to missing or damaged material and if the
employer sets forth in a written statement a reasonable suspicion
that the worker was involved in the loss.
</P>
<P>
Any such polygraph exam would have to be conducted under strict
conditions, with no questions about personal beliefs and sexual
behavior, and the exam results alone could not be used as a basis
for discipline or a refusal to hire.
``Complaints about polygraph abuse and firings based on polygraph
abuse have been one of the single largest sources of calls to ACLU
offices nationwide,'' Goldberg said.
``Now employees can complain to the Department of Labor or go
into court to protect themselves against these inaccurate gadgets,''
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
She said the law would have the greatest impact in Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
Virginia and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said employers in the following states, which allow
businesses to request people to take lie detector tests, could be
affected by the new law: California, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland,
Montana, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 14 states and the District of Columbia have laws
banning polygraph examinations for employment purposes, and these
laws take precedence over the new federal statute if they are more
restrictive, according to Goldberg.

Polygraphs Face Moment of Truth

<P>
A prosecutor calls it ``witchcraft'' and a
psychologist says it's as reliable as a coin toss.
</P>
<P>
After years of debate, court rulings and federal legislation,
use of the polygraph has dropped sharply, despite supporters who
insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a
lie.
``They have been useless and give misleading information,'' said
Leonard Saxe, a visiting professor of psychology at Brandeis
University and a leading opponent of polygraph testing. ``They
suggest whether you're guilty or innocent. You might as well flip a
coin.''
Last week, the state Supreme Court banned lie detector tests
from being introduced as evidence in criminal trials. Massachusetts
had been one of the last remaining states that gave defendants the
right to use polygraphs to support their alibis.
</P>
<P>
The court, noting polygraph studies have shown success rates
varying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent, said: ``There
remains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraph
testing to detect deceit.''
The court was not alone in deciding against polygraphs, which
attempt to determine someone's honesty by their physiological
response to certain questions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress prohibited most private sector employers
from using lie dectectors to screen job applicants or randomly test
workers.
</P>
<P>
Exempted from the rules were federal, state and local
governments, firms that do sensitive work for agencies like the CIA
and FBI, companies that provide security services and those that
make or distribute controlled substances.
``I think it's appropriate to seek if someone is lying, and the
most appropriate way is to seek evidence,'' said Judy Crockett, who
fought on behalf of the federal law for the American Civil
Liberties Union. ``Polygraphs tend to be an attempt to short-cut
investigations.''
The federal law, which took effect a year ago, has taken a big
bite out of the polygraph business.
``There's been a definite decline in the private sector,'' said
Chris Fausett, product manager for Lafayette Instrument Co., based
in Lafayette, Ind., one of the country's largest makers of
polygraph machines.
</P>
<P>
He declined to give specific numbers, but he said the drop was
``about as sharp as you can get.''
``No doubt businesses have had to abandon 75-80 percent of
polygraph tests,'' said Joseph Buckley, a spokesman for the
American Polygraph Association, a trade group based in Chattanooga,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
Buckley said his group had about 3,000 members a year ago, but
the number has dropped by a third. ``A lot of them had to change
careers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
However, these trends do not mean polygraph testing is dead.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies use lie detectors to interview
witnesses when investigating crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Defense uses polygraph testing to search for
spies, and also to screen job applicants if something suspicious
arises in background checks, said spokesman Jim Turner.
</P>
<P>
Reading from a Defense Department statement regarding the use of
polygraphs, Turner said:
``In all instances the polygraph exam process produced data of
important security or criminal significance which was not otherwise
obtainable. It was also invaluable in establishing the innocence of
people confronted with serious accusations.''
Many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if both
the prosecution and defense agree.
</P>
<P>
New Mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a
polygraph examination as evidence, with the trial judge deciding
whether the tests meet certain standards. But not everyone in the
state supports it.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Cornish, a prosecutor in the New Mexico attorney
general's office, called polygraph exams ``witchcraft.''
``It can, if used in an unbridled way, change the entire
truth-seeking process,'' he said. ``It replaces the jury.''
David Raskin, a University of Utah psychologist often called
upon to support polygraphs in the courtroom, said he favored the
federal law because lie detectors were being misused to predict
future performance in the workplace. But he said they are reliable
tools in determining someone's past actions.
``Every piece of evidence has a dose of uncertainty,'' Raskin
said. ``Jurors are very cautious with polygraph evidence. They are
overly skeptical. They do not ignore other evidence and concentrate
on the polygraph.''

Polygraph Expert Appears Before Grand Jury
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A grand jury's questioning of a polygraph
expert who is helping investigate the bombing of Pan AM Flight 103
indicates the Justice Department's probe is entering a new phase.
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Washington heard testimony last Friday
from James Keefe, a polygraph expert for a security consulting firm
hired by lawyers representing Pan Am in a civil suit over the Dec.
21, 1988 bombing.
</P>
<P>
Keefe testified about giving polygraph tests to three Pan Am
baggage handlers in Frankfurt, West Germany, during his appearance
before the grand jury, said a source familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
Keefe told the panel two of the three baggage handlers failed
the polygraph tests when they said they knew nothing about the
transfer of a piece of luggage to Flight 103, said the source, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The source confirmed a report published in Tuesday's editions of
the Syracuse Post Standard.
</P>
<P>
Keefe's appearance before the grand jury indicates U.S.
authorities are stepping up their investigation of the bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 259 passengers and crew members and
11 people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Anti-terrorism laws give federal prosecutors in Washington
jurisdiction to bring cases in acts that occur abroad.
</P>
<P>
Scottish police believe the bomb was in a suitcase that was
placed aboard Pan Am Flight 103 in Frankfurt before it took off for
London. Passengers and luggage were transferred to a Boeing 747 at
London's Heathrow Airport for the trans-Atlantic leg of the trip to
New York City.
</P>
<P>
The suitcase is believed to have been brought to Frankfurt
aboard a plane from Malta. Investigators found clothing fragments
in Lockerbie that were traced to a clothing store in Malta,
according to a federal law enforcement source.
</P>
<P>
The bombing investigation has focused on a number of terrorist
organizations, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
</P>
<P>
Polygraph tests cannot be admitted in court, but the questions
Keefe asked the baggage handlers and their responses may provide
investigators with new leads in the case.
</P>
<P>
Keefe works for Interfor Inc., a New York-based security
consulting firm retained by lawyers representing Pan Am's insurance
carrier in a $300 million damage suit filed by relatives of people
killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
He was served with the grand jury subpoena on Jan. 25 as he
stepped off a plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New
York following his return from Europe, said the source.

LIE TESTS FOR POLICE APPLICANTS AFFIRMED; 
COURTS: APPELLATE PANEL SAYS POLYGRAPH EXAMS DO NOT VIOLATE CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHTS TO PRIVACY. THE RULING WILL BE BINDING ON TRIAL COURTS THROUGHOUT THE 
STATE. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state Court of Appeal ruled Monday that cities and counties may require 
applicants for jobs as police officers to submit to polygraph tests about their 
character and background. 
</P>
<P>
In a 2-1 decision, the panel rejected claims that such testing violated the 
state constitutional right to privacy or conflicted with statutes that bar such 
tests for public safety officers already on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"(Municipalities) have a compelling governmental interest in conducting a 
comprehensive background investigation and in utilizing the polygraph 
examination to protect the public from applicants who may be attempting to 
conceal undetected criminal activity, racial prejudice, sexual aberrance or 
violent tendencies," Appellate Justice James F. Perley wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
The panel noted that the right to privacy was "not absolute" - and said that a 
city's interest in ensuring its officers were of the highest integrity 
outweighed any harm suffered by an applicant who loses a job opportunity for 
refusing the test. 
</P>
<P>
The court acknowledged that some critics have questioned the reliability of the 
polygraph, or so-called "lie detector." But proponents and opponents of the 
device agree that a polygraph test can distinguish between truth and deception 
"with an accuracy greater than chance," the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Given a police officer's unique status in society, compulsory polygraph 
testing of applicants for police officer positions is justified," Perley said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision sought to resolve an important question left open by a ruling by 
the state Supreme Court in 1986 that held unconstitutional any involuntary 
polygraph tests for public employees. State statutes already had barred such 
testing of private employees and police officers. The court's holding, however, 
did not settle the issue for applicants for public safety jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling, unless overturned by the state high court, will be binding on 
trial courts throughout California. According to attorneys in the case, at 
least half of the cities and counties in the state currently require applicants 
for public safety jobs to take polygraph tests. 
</P>
<P>
Michael H. Roush, an attorney representing the city of Vallejo in its defense 
of the practice in the case before the court, welcomed the ruling. "Cities have 
an interest in making sure they hire the right candidates for jobs that have 
important powers in this society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Pinckard, a deputy city attorney representing San Diego and three 
other cities backing Vallejo in the case, said the ruling was especially 
important in view of state laws barring polygraph exams for officers already on 
the job. "The only place to catch (wrongdoers) is at the pre-employment stage," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco attorney Duane W. Reno, who represented a former officer who 
challenged the tests, said an appeal to the state Supreme Court would be 
considered. Reno said there are "less intrusive means" to screen applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came in the case of Clarence E. Rust, a former police officer in the 
city of Vallejo who was granted disability retirement for chronic back problems 
but later sought reinstatement to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Rust refused the city's requirement that he take a polygraph test and filed a 
lawsuit, charging violation of his constitutional and civil rights. In support 
of his suit, he cited the statutes that prohibit officers from being forced to 
submit to such tests against their will, along with language in the 1986 state 
high court decision suggesting cities would bear a heavy legal burden in 
justifying the tests for applicants for public safety jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A Solano County Superior Court rejected Rust's claims and the Court of Appeal, 
in its ruling Monday, affirmed that ruling, concluding that both applicants - 
and ex-officers seeking reinstatement - could be required to take the tests as 
a condition for getting the job. 
</P>
<P>
The panel noted that pre-employment polygraph screening is widely used by 
intelligence and law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. 
Although 23 states, including California, have in some way restricted tests, 14 
have specifically permitted law enforcement agencies to conduct them for 
applicants, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Perley's 23-page opinion was joined by Appellate Justice Carl West Anderson. In 
dissent, Appellate Justice Marc Poche said that ex-officers like Rust should be 
treated like officers holding jobs and be protected against involuntary testing 
when they seek reinstatement.

  HILL PASSES POLYGRAPH TAKEN AT HER REQUEST  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anita Hill took a lie detector test Sunday - and the polygraph expert who
administered it said she is telling the truth in accusing Clarence Thomas of
sexual harassment.;   Polygraph expert Paul K. Minor told reporters that Hill
did not deceive the Senate Judiciary Committee when she testified Friday that
Thomas had discussed pornographic material and various sex acts with her.  
</P>
<P>
Trying to save her name; Charles Ogletree, a Harvard law professor and one
of Hill's lawyers, said Hill wanted to take the test to refute the attacks
made on her motives and integrity by Republican senators Saturday.;   However,
the significance of polygraph tests is limited. They are not admitted as
evidence in most courtrooms because the scientific community believes they are
insufficiently reliable and judges believe juries give them too much weight.; 
The danger of polygraph tests is that "some people are able to fool lie
detectors because they believe what they're saying, even though it isn't
true," Georgetown University criminal law professor Paul Rothstein said.;  
What Hill was asked; Minor, a well known polygraph expert who has taught FBI
polygraph operators, said he put four questions to Hill:;   (check) Have you
deliberately lied to me about Clarence Thomas?;   (check) Are you fabricating
the allegation that Clarence Thomas discussed pornographic material with you?;
(check) Are you lying to me about the various topics that Clarence Thomas
mentioned to you regarding specific sexual acts?;   (check) Are you lying to
me about Clarence Thomas making references to you about the size of his
penis?;   She answered "no" to each question. "There was no indication of
deception to any of the relevant questions," Minor said outside the hearing
room. "It's therefore my opinion Ms. Hill is truthful.";   Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum asked that Hill's polygraph results be placed in the committee
record, but chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., refused, noting that courts did not
accept such evidence and that the test had been produced outside committee
control.;   Nevertheless, Rothstein said, "polygraphs are 60 to 80 percent
reliable, depending upon whom you ask," and Peter Tague, also a Georgetown
criminal law specialist, said that "Prof. Hill's willingness to take a
polygraph test tends to support her credibility.";   The devices purport to
detect untruthful answers by measuring changes in blood pressure, pulse rate
and perspiration.;   While he is considered to be a prominent expert in his
field, Minor's reputation is not without controversy.;   In July 1980, Minor,
who was then with the FBI, administered two polygraph tests to Herman Sillas,
then the U.S. attorney in Sacramento, to determine the veracity of allegations
that he had taken a $7,500 bribe from a prison inmate several years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The test was later determined to have been improperly administered.;   Minor
could not be reached for comment Sunday.

  DETECTING THE TRUTH
RANGE OF EXPERTS SHARPLY DIVIDED ON ACCURACY OF
POLYGRAPH TESTS

<TEXT>
<P>
ANITA HILL took one to clear her name, but in the end, it didn't matter.;  
Millionaire-turned-cocaine dealer John DeLorean took one because he thought he
could beat it. He didn't.  
</P>
<P>
The construction workers on the site where the Oakland hills fire may have
started also took one. They were cleared of suspicion.;   It's a polygraph
test, an examination by that simple machine that supposedly detects the lies
of those who submit to its cold wires and straps.;   Believers in the
polygraph include 2,000 polygraph examiners, plus criminologists, attorneys,
police departments and the CIA.;   They say their tests work because when
people lie, their anxiety and fear of being caught involuntarily cause changes
in their heartbeats and the way they breathe and sweat. Polygraph machines
detect these changes.;   Critics, including psychologists, labor unions and
many judges, say the polygraph is nothing but a crude interrogation tool with
as much credibility as a mood ring. They say it's a mistake to equate fear and
distress with guilt.;   "Wouldn't it be nice if you had a simple test to prove
deception?" said David Lykken, professor of psychology at the University of
Minnesota and a nationally  known polygraph expert. "But we aren't made like
Pinocchio.";   The public usually hears about polygraph tests when somebody
famous takes one, often in situations where it's one person's word against
another. William Kennedy Smith's accuser took the test - and passed - to
"prove" she was telling the truth when she said he raped her.;   Ronald Reagan
was fond of polygraph tests. But in 1985, when he would have forced Cabinet
members to take them, Secretary of State George Shultz threatened to resign
and Reagan quietly dropped the idea.;   Pre-employment testing;   The test
gained popularity in the 1970s, when it was used by retail stores and other
private firms to screen job applicants. It lost ground in 1989, when the
federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act took effect, outlawing
pre-employment polygraph testing in most private industry. The act was
endorsed by unions who said the polygraph was an invasion of privacy with
questionable reliability.;   However, the pre-employment polygraph is still
widely used for job applicants in many government offices, including the San
Jose Police Department.;   The credibility of the polygraph is questioned in
criminal courtrooms throughout the country. Twenty-three states allow
polygraph results to be admitted as evidence, but usually only if both sides
agree in advance. California is one.;   Polygraph literally means "many
writings." The instrument measures several body responses - breathing, blood
pressure and sweat. It was invented in the 1920s by William Moulton Marston, a
lawyer who later went on to create the comic strip "Wonder Woman.";   The
testing procedure begins with a discussion of the test and the allegations.
</P>
<P>
One purpose of this pre-test interview is to reduce the subject's anxiety and
fear, and take the surprise out of the allegations. Another purpose is to help
the examiner craft questions aimed at eliciting both true statements and lies
as a basis for comparison.;   Not just physiological;   The test is not merely
physiological. Polygraphers can be sly and manipulative in the interest of
producing an accurate test. They rely on complex assumptions about human
nature and criminal psychology, and their subjects are often unaware how
extensively they are being analyzed.;   The polygraph test itself is short -
usually no more than 10 questions. Two to four questions are directly relevant
to the issue at hand - "Did you steal the $400?";   These questions are mixed
with others that are less relevant but help the examiner analyze the responses
- "Do you live in California?" or "Have you ever stolen anything in your
life?";   Then the examiner interprets the test and pronounces the subject
truthful or deceptive.;   The examiner also looks for clues to deception -
movement at this question, sweating at that one, a pause or a blink.;   More
'art' than science?;   "Candidly, there's a lot of art that goes into it,"
said Paul Minor, former FBI chief of polygraphs, who tested John DeLorean and
Anita Hill.;   Critics say there's too much art involved and not enough
science.;   "The highly trained examiner is relying on their skill as an
interrogator," said Oakland labor lawyer Brad Seligman, who successfully
opposed pre-employment polygraph tests in 1989 at an electronics store chain.
</P>
<P>
"The machine is a good prop that the examiner uses to convince people that the
machine knows everything.";   Critics say polygraphers' premises are flawed.
</P>
<P>
They say it is normal for both guilty and innocent alike to be distressed by
relevant questions.;   "It's a natural reaction to being accused," Leonard
Saxe, a polygraph expert and psychologist at City University of New York. "The
guilty person is going to be afraid of getting caught, while the innocent
person is afraid of being wrongly accused.";   But veteran San Jose
polygrapher George Harman said anxiety and nervousness do not affect his
results.;   "The problem is when you have a person with not enough
nervousness," Harman said. "You can get an inconclusive test result.";  
Pathological liars;   Studies also have been done by polygraphers to prove
that pathological liars and psychopaths have no advantage because both types
know they're lying and neither wants to get caught, said David Raskin, a
polygraph examiner and University of Utah psychologist.;   Polygraph examiners
claim accuracy rates as high as 95 percent. But they admit that the only way
to prove they were right is when a deceptive person later confesses. Guilty
people who pass the test leave undetected.;   Those accuracy claims are
challenged by polygraph opponents, who point to studies done by polygraphers
themselves that say an innocent person has as much as a 50-50 chance of
failing. Other studies show more accurate results for guilty people, saying
they are correctly identified 79 percent of the time or better.;   One of the
most famous accuracy studies cited by polygraph advocates was conducted in
1969 by psychologist Philip Bersh for the U.S. Department of Defense.;   90
percent agreement;   A panel of lawyers reviewed evidence (other than the
polygraph test) against 400 criminal suspects, then concluded whether the
suspects were innocent or guilty. Results were matched against the suspects'
polygraphs, and in 90 percent of the cases, they agreed.;   "There isn't any
single study that resolves the controversy when one wants to know the accuracy
of the polygraph in the real world," said Frank Horvath, president of the
American Polygraph Association and professor of criminology at Michigan State
University at East Lansing.;   Both sides expect the controversy to go on for
as long as it takes science to come up with the perfect lie detector. Some say
it will never happen; others are content that society has come close enough
with the polygraph.;   "Ask yourself, how does the polygraph compare to other
methods we have in our society of determining somebody's guilt or innocence?"
Horvath said. "We all know that innocent people are sometimes convicted and
guilty people frequently walk. The trial process isn't infallible either."

 House Labor Panel Clears Bill to Bar
Use of Lie-Detector Tests by Employers
-

<P>
The House Labor Committee approved a bill that would prohibit private employers from using lie detectors to test workers. 
</P>
<P>
The panel voted 25-9 for the measure, which is bitterly opposed by many companies, especially pharmaceutical concerns, banks, retailers and other service-industry employers. 
</P>
<P>
Unions, especially in food and related industries, have pushed for the legislation, contending that polygraphs are unreliable in showing a person's veracity, and are an invasion of workers' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Before approving the bill, the Labor Committee rejected a spate of amendments that would have exempted pharmaceutical, nursing and day care, security-guard and other businesses from the polygraph ban. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept the legitimacy of the device," so there shouldn't be any exemptions, said Ernest Dubester, an AFL-CIO lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than limit the legislation's curb on polygraph use, the committee adopted by voice vote an amendment offered by Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.) that would also prohibit use of such equipment as voice-stress analyzers, but would allow written and oral tests, that are aimed at detecting employee deception. 
</P>
<P>
The polygraph bill is one of several labor-backed measures that are picking up steam in Congress after having stalled in past sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the House passed a similar lie-detector bill, and the Senate Labor Committee approved its own version. 
</P>
<P>
But some Republican senators, aided by a veto threat by President Reagan and sizable business opposition, kept the measure off the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected soon to produce a new polygraph bill, which may be narrower than the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
Drafters of the Senate measure are considering limiting the use of lie detectors to workers who are suspects for a specific criminal act, for example, while prohibiting its general use in pre-employment screening or for random testing. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of polygraph testing contend that tests are especially unreliable when they're used in such general ways. 
</P>
<P>
Permitting limited polygraph tests might garner business support that could gain White House backing for the bill, a Senate Labor panel official said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the options being considered are an outright ban as in the House bill, regulating polygraph use instead of prohibiting it, or letting employers request that workers take a lie-detector test. 
</P>
<P>
Banning polygraph use by private employers would affect about 98% of its use, the AFL-CIO's Mr. Dubester said, while allowing government intelligence and other agencies to continue testing of employees in especially sensitive work. 
</P>
<P>
The prohibition would follow a trend set by many states; 31 states now have laws either banning or regulating the use of polygraphs. 
</P>
<P>
But prohibiting polygraphs would strip many employers of a useful tool for fighting rising worker crime, either by uncovering employee theft, or by deterring job applicants or current employees from illegal acts, said Mark de Bernardo, labor-law official for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Congress in 1985 allowed the Defense Department to expand polygraph screening of personnel with access to sensitive classified information. 
</P>
<P>
It's "ironic," he said, that many lawmakers favor a ban on private polygraph use though they voted for allowing more military usage. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's useful and reliable, it's useful and reliable across the board," Mr. de Bernardo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber supports a measure recently introduced by Reps. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Young (R., Fla.) and George Darden (D., Ga.) that would require licensing and regulation of polygraph operators. 
</P>
<P>
Lie detectors can catch wrongdoers and also absolve innocent suspects, Mr. de Bernardo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber cites estimates by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores that consumers pay 10% to 15% more for goods to cover losses from employee theft, and a Drug Enforcement Administration estimate that as much as one million doses of drugs are stolen annually by pharmacy, drug manufacturer and distributor workers. 
</P>
<P>
Legal drugs, stolen and distributed without prescriptions, kill or injure twice as many people as illicit drugs, the DEA has said.

 Japan Union Protests Polygraph-Test Rule At U.S. Navy Bases 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE> TOKYO (AP)  
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese workers at U.S. Navy bases are protesting a policy that requires workers who deal with confidential matters to submit to lie-detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan neglects our basic human rights," said Misao Kamiyama, chairman of the All Japanese Garrison Forces Labor Union, which represents 1,200 workers at the U.S. bases. 
</P>
<P>
The union asked the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, which hires Japanese workers for the bases, to urge the U.S. to drop the polygraph requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, only criminals get that kind of treatment," Mr. Kamiyama said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are planning a full-scale nationwide protest against the decision" if the agency doesn't respond by today. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy briefed the workers on the tests in April. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kamiyama said about 500 Japanese were asked to sign an agreement to take a polygraph examination and were "threatened to be transferred to other sections if they refuse to sign." 
The accuracy of polygraph tests is widely disputed. 
</P>
<P>
An agency spokesman said it consented to the U.S. plan but expressed concern about the "human-rights standpoint" of polygraph tests. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, didn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The agency acts as liaison between the U.S. military in Japan and the Japanese government. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, only employees at Navy plants would have to take the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Since September 1987, the Navy has been requiring the polygraph test before it grants "limited-access authorization," to personnel, a U.S. military spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 Japanese base workers are subject to the lie-detector test, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Most work at ship-repair facilities in Yokosuka and Sasebo. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kamiyama said transfers of employees who refused to take the tests could fuel anti-American sentiment.

 Law Limiting Use of Lie Detectors Is Seen Having Widespread Effect 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Employees at businesses ranging from retail operations to Wall Street brokerage firms will soon be much less likely to have to play truth or consequences with lie detectors. 
</P>
<P>
A bill signed into law Monday by President Reagan will sharply restrict employers' use of polygraph tests. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, about two million U.S. workers annually take such tests when applying for jobs or when companies are investigating theft or other employee violations. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, which becomes effective on Dec. 27, bars pre-hiring polygraph screening and random testing, and it sets strict rules about giving the tests to workers suspected of a particular wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Some businesses, including pharmaceutical companies and many firms that provide security guards for operations related to "health and safety," are exempt from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of polygraph testing, who claim it's both unreliable and subject to potential abuse, are welcoming the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
But many employers - as well as many of the outside companies that typically administer the tests - argue that the measure will crimp security. 
</P>
<P>
They insist that lie detectors are a useful, and even necessary, tool in curbing employee crime. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the new law, employers who have relied heavily on lie detectors will have to resort to such alternatives as written tests that are designed to gauge a person's honesty, and background checks of job applicants - something that critics of polygraphs say they should have been doing in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
A broad range of workers will be affected by the new law. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street firms, for example, commonly use lie detectors for investigations and pre-employment interviews, mainly of individuals who are likely to deal with confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
Such testing isn't confined to low-level employees, according to the Securities Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
Managers and other white-collar workers in the securities industry have been subject to polygraph tests where circumstances warrant, the trade group says, adding that the decision to test hinges on the employee's "access to negotiable instruments, currency or securities - not on the employee's rank." 
While he was chairman of the Securities 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Exchange Commission, John Shad testified in a congressional hearing on polygraph testing that brokerage houses need to keep using lie detectors to protect "trillions of dollars" of securities. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread polygraph testing of bank workers and executives will also be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of some 160 large banks, taken about 18 months ago by the Bank Administration Institute at a bank-security seminar, found that 78% of the banks used polygraphs to check up on their employees. 
</P>
<P>
This, the trade group says, is far more than the percentage that undertake background investigations, criminal-record checks or urine testing for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The law is expected to have a significant impact as well on the companies that actually administer the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Kaufman, president of New York Lie Detection Laboratories, a security-services firm whose clients include a number of brokerage houses, figures the law will "knock out about 98% of our polygraph business." 
Mr. Kaufman asserts that even the use of lie-detector tests when there has been a theft, which will still be permitted under the new law, will end because employers will have to do such things as give an employee a written statement to the effect that he is "reasonably" suspected of stealing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like buying a lawsuit," Mr. Kaufman says. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing you would do when you get a letter like that is go to a lawyer - after a martini." 
Some critics of polygraph testing say a major problem with lie detectors is that a conscientious but easily upset truth teller could show the quickened pulse, faster breathing, increased blood pressure and skin reactions that a polygraph typically measures. 
</P>
<P>
At present, polygraph results generally aren't considered admissible evidence in federal court and are similarly banned in the courts of 27 states. 
</P>
<P>
"Polygraph testing and scoring methods currently used in personnel screening have never been shown to be valid tests of truthfulness," said John F. Beary, an assistant dean at Georgetown University School of Medicine, in recent testimony before Congress for the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
"The polygraph," he added, "cannot detect lies much better than a coin toss." 
While polygraph specialists say the devices can achieve 90% accuracy, critics contend that the accuracy rate can be as low as 25% and that a tough-minded liar can often control himself well enough to pass the test. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lynch, the director of enforcement at the SEC, recalls some investment bankers who passed their polygraph tests with flying colors during insider-trading probes. 
</P>
<P>
They later became cooperative witnesses for the commission, Mr. Lynch says, and "it turns out they were lying" to the lie detector. 
</P>
<P>
One banker who will be glad of the new restrictions is Peter Persaud, who says he was denied a job as a vice president of Amerifirst Bank in Miami after twice flunking polygraph tests early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Persaud alleges in an interview that the young woman examiner who gave him the first test for Amerifirst made him angry by persistently asking questions about stealing and kickbacks; by seeming incredulous when he said that he had no credit-card debt and a mortgage on only one of his three houses; and by implying that he had earlier told her his name was George. 
</P>
<P>
The second examiner asked similar questions, he claims, provoking more anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the polygraph test is designed to make an honest person seem dishonest because of the way it is administered," Mr. Persaud says. 
</P>
<P>
Amerifirst says it doesn't comment on confidential matters involving job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Other employees, too, cite problems arising from polygraph tests. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Darby, a former manager of a Zale Corp. jewelry store in Duluth, Ga., says that after Zale had a theft problem in an Atlanta store in 1986, the company gave lie detector tests to all of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Darby says he took the test for fear he would be dismissed if he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before Congress in support of the bill, he alleged that the examiners pressured him into writing down any gossip he had heard about the conduct of other Zale workers - including drug use - by telling him he would flunk the test and be fired if he didn't comply. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Darby quit, vowing he would never take another polygraph exam. 
</P>
<P>
Zale says it doesn't comment on former employees. 
</P>
<P>
Zale's policy, a spokeswoman explains, is to do "very selective" polygraph testing during an investigation of suspected theft or loss. 
</P>
<P>
The company stopped pre-employment tests last year, the spokeswoman notes. 
</P>
<P>
The bill to ban most polygraph tests was widely backed by civil-liberties groups, labor unions and Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, as well as by such organizations as the AMA and the American Psychological Association. 
</P>
<P>
Among the opponents was the Justice Department, which tried to persuade President Reagan to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
In Congress, the legislation passed with bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward Kennedy, the liberal Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Labor Committee, calls polygraphs "20th-century witchcraft." 
Conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee's ranking Republican, says 500,000 "honest people each year are branded as liars" by false lie-detector results.
