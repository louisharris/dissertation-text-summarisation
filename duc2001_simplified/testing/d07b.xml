Explorers From Six Countries Plan Trek Across Antarctica
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the untouched expanse of the Arctic icecap it seemed a mirage
_ preposterous, incredible: ski tracks.
</P>
<P>
Will Steger, leading the first unsupported dogsled trek to the
North Pole since Adm. Robert Peary's, saw the unmistakable evidence
of cross-country skis. He knew they could only be those of
Jean-Louis Etienne, a Frenchman who was about to become the first
man to ski alone to the pole.
</P>
<P>
It was in April 1986, in a tent on the monotonous frozen
landscape, that the two adventurers sipped tea and dreamed of their
next quest: a multinational trek across Antarctica. After reaching
their destination, they began planning the Trans-Antarctica
Expedition, which is to begin Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
Their previous exploits were for the sheer joy of pitting man
against nature. This one would do that and more: draw attention to
threats against nature and to the need for international
cooperation in protecting Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Steger and Etienne enlisted scientists and explorers from the
Soviet Union, China, Japan and Great Britain for a seven-month,
4,000-mile trip. Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and
giant snow tractors, but this will be the first unmechanized
attempt.
</P>
<P>
Victor Boyarsky of the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Research
Institute, a popular explorer and veteran of polar travel, is a
co-leader. The other members of the team are glaciologist Qin Dahe
of China; Geoff Somers, who has spent 42 months in Antarctica with
the British Antarctic Survey; and Keizo Funatsu of Japan, a former
economist who turned to dog-sledding and adventure.
</P>
<P>
Somers will plot the trek's course; Funatsu is in charge of the
dogs.
</P>
<P>
Steger, who in the past has picked his own teams, says he is
honored that the Soviet Union and China will be sending official
representatives. The four members from Western nations are not
formally backed by their governments.
</P>
<P>
Steger recalled that when he asked if Boyarsky spoke English, a
Soviet official replied: ``In one year, he will speak English very
well.''
``A real interesting diplomatic challenge,'' Steger called it.
</P>
<P>
Other international support includes the use of China's Great
Wall Station on King George Island as a staging point. New
Zealanders stationed at the Scott McArdle base donated 12 dogs
whose lineage can be traced to dogs owned by polar explorer Richard
Byrd. The Soviet Union provided an icebreaker to transport 15 tons
of food for the men and 36 dogs; the provisions were cached on the
route in November. The USSR also plans to send a military cargo
plane to pick up the team from its rendezvous at Steger's Minnesota
camp; the U.S. State Department, while not officially sanctioning
the trek, is expected to let the plane land.
</P>
<P>
After refueling in Cuba, the team will fly to the Great Wall
Base, about 600 miles south of the tip of South America. The
expedition, which will set out in the middle of the Austral winter,
will at first follow known landmarks.
``We'll have maps for the first 1,500 miles. The last 2,500
miles there is virtually nothing. It's flat. There's nothing to
map,'' Steger said.
</P>
<P>
They'll cross the Ellsworth Mountains and skirt Mt. Vinson, the
continent's highest spot at 16,860 feet. They'll visit three
American bases _ Palmer, Siple and Amundsen-Scott at the South
Pole, where they plan to celebrate Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The next dot of civilization they'll aim for is the Soviet base
at Vostok, near the magnetic south pole. Vostok, the coldest place
on Earth, will serve as a base for a French documentary film crew
that will travel with the expedition for three weeks, and for the
team's pilot.
</P>
<P>
By March, the trekkers should reach the Soviet base of Mirnyy on
the east coast, also known as Queen Mary Coast, ending the longest
possible traverse.
</P>
<P>
They'll be picked up by the expedition ship, built in France
with a special aluminum hull designed to pop up and settle intact
on top of the ice rather than be trapped and crushed.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 45 nations have signed television contracts with
the expedition. ABC has bought exclusive U.S. TV rights. ``We want
the world to know much, much more about Antarctica after our
expedition than it did before we set out,'' Steger said.
</P>
<P>
The continent is roughly the shape of a bottle cap. It rises
sharply at the perimeter, then flattens out in a vast, high plateau
at an average elevation of 9,500 feet. Antarctica's 5.4 million
square miles is more than China and India combined. It has no
indigenous people, and wildlife is confined to the coast.
</P>
<P>
A treaty signed in 1959 by a dozen nations, with additional
signatories in subsequent years, put all territorial claims on
Antarctica on hold, banned military activity and established
freedom of scientific inquiry.
</P>
<P>
But many countries now have designs on the land for strategic,
political and even economic reasons _ some expect to find oil, coal
and mineral deposits under the ice. Some want to see the continent
cut into pie-shaped wedges, but Steger wants the people of the
world to demand that it be protected, intact.
``It sounds like a very lofty goal, but Antarctica is a going to
play a very important role in the future of the planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Planetary warming of just a few degrees could melt the polar ice
caps, raising sea level and flooding coastal areas, but Steger said
it's simplistic to worry about submerged cities. With 85 percent of
the planet's fresh water stored in the snow and ice of Antarctica,
a thaw would reduce the salinity of the oceans, change ocean
currents and wreak havoc with weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
The other environmental nightmare awakening interest in
Antarctica is the discovery of a giant hole in the ozone layer
directly over the continent. Ozone screens the planet from excess
ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
Scientists predict continued ozone depletion will increase skin
cancer, but such thinking is ``myopic,'' Steger said. Most
significantly, increased solar radiation could disrupt the
reproduction cycles of plankton, the microscopic oceanic plants and
animals that are the basis of the global food chain.
</P>
<P>
These ominous changes are most apparent in Antarctica, making it
``like a canary in a mine,'' Steger said.
</P>
<P>
The team will be under the ozone hole for about 40 days and 500
miles as they cross a 13,000-foot high plateau known as the Area of
Inaccessibility. It's the worst possible place on earth for
ultraviolet exposure.
</P>
<P>
The team will carry a monitor and Boyarsky will record ozone
levels at regular intervals, the first cross-section of ozone
across the continent.
</P>
<P>
Qin will take snow and ice samples all the way across
Antarctica, recording temperatures and oxygen content for a
geological history of the icecap.
</P>
<P>
Etienne, a physician, will monitor cholesterol levels of the
team members, who will rely on the high-fat diet typical of
cultures in cold regions.
</P>
<P>
But the experiments that can be done along the way are limited
by time and weight. The trekkers plan to travel 30 miles a day on
cross-country skis, and the three dogsleds can carry no more than
900 pounds of gear.
</P>
<P>
Steger admits they won't attempt ``pure science'' but he hopes
the findings will contribute to the knowledge of this frontier.
``We need international cooperation. Solutions to environmental
problems must be global.''

Thirty-nine nations meet in Paris this week on
the controversial future of Antarctica. An AP correspondent who has
been to the disputed continent reports on what is at stake.
</P>
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antarctica, the last place on Earth where nature
reigns over man, is facing a showdown between those who want to tap
its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched
under ice.
</P>
<P>
The majestic continent at the bottom of the world, larger than
United States and Mexico combined, is still peopled by scant
thousands who have to import everything but ice cubes.
</P>
<P>
Although 16 nations fly flags in Antarctica, and seven claim
slices of it, no one holds title. No one needs a passport. It is a
vast global common, ruled only by the harsh, unforgiving elements.
</P>
<P>
But statesmen, scientists and environmentalists must decide soon
whether Antarctica will open up to oilmen and airmen, miners,
commercial fishermen, hotelkeepers and, possibly, colonists.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, bginning Monday, 39 nations will review the 1959
Antarctic Treaty that expires in 1991. They also will examine the
remains of the Antarctic Minerals Convention, signed in May 1988.
</P>
<P>
The convention would have allowed controlled mining and oil
exploration, replacing a voluntary moratorium. But Australia, one
of seven claimant nations with a veto, decided not to ratify it.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the Soviet Union and Japan, among others, are
pressing for a minerals accord. France, echoing Australia's
concerns, wants Antarctica to be an unspoiled world park.
</P>
<P>
Delegates were guarded over an eventual compromise. The 1988
convention took six years to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Proponents say a world short of resources has no choice.
</P>
<P>
Antarctica hoards unknown quantities of gold, platinum and other
strategic metals, along with oil in amounts estimated to be in the
billions of barrels.
</P>
<P>
Detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitably
pollutes a reserve crucial to man's survival. Upsetting its
delicate balance, they say, will have consequences no one can
predict.
</P>
<P>
Undeniably, the world is already muscling in. Penguin livers are
tainted with pesticides and plastics. Century-old garbage litters
pristine panoramas. Antarctica has had its first oil spill.
``Trash thrown into the North Sea will eventually settle in
Antarctica,'' the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau once
told The Associated Press. ``The world is a closed system.''
In a more recent interview, he railed against plans to exploit
the last untamed place on earth.
``That would be almost criminal, at least stupid,'' he said.
``It would be a catastrophe.''
Scientists worry that tourists, whose numbers now approach
10,000 a year, endanger fragile ecosystems. Huge ice floes menace
ships' hulls, adding a threat of oil pollution.
</P>
<P>
Yet it is the ancient lure of the mysterious continent, largely
unexplored for all of history's daring expeditions, that make it
such a disputed prize.
</P>
<P>
Antarctica is 98 percent under ice, but it is no more a white
continent than Africa is a dark one.
</P>
<P>
Old ice grows blue, then rich turquoise. As the sun shifts its
angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond, Antarctica is aglow
in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas.
</P>
<P>
Penguin colonies, like rush-hour crowds dressed in black tie,
amuse scientists who try to take them seriously. Seals frolic and
birds move from place to place in turbulent clouds.
</P>
<P>
For all the beauty, arguments focus on survival of the planet.
</P>
<P>
President Francois Mitterrand of France, making the case for a
world wilderness area, told scientists from 40 countries at a June
meeting: ``It's not just the forests, the prairies or rivers that
are in danger. It's the entire Earth.''
Specialists regard Antarctica as the world's weather factory.
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, scientists there have measured the Earth's
thinning ozone layer, letting through radiation that risks
catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels.
</P>
<P>
A New Zealand team recently reported the ozone hole over
Antarctica was much more serious than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
Cousteau warns that jostling the precarious balance invites
calamity. For example, just scraping the surface of the Earth
spreads dust that alters reflectivity, raising temperatures and
melting ice.
</P>
<P>
Human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birds
and marine mammals, scientists say. Fishing threatens a delicate
food chain that depends upon plentiful supplies of krill, a tiny
shrimp.
</P>
<P>
In Antarctica, with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds,
accidents are common. Once damage is done, experience shows, it is
very difficult to correct.

Call Out For U.S. Regulation of Its Burgeoning Antarctica Tour
Industry
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. tour operators are planning to send a
record 4,000 or more travelers to Antarctica, prompting calls for
strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife
and the very fate of the frozen continent.
``The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than
tripled in the past five years,'' said Bruce Manheim, a Washington
activist of the Environmental Defense Fund who calls existing
controls inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Antarctica has become a ``hot'' travel destination for the
1990s, beckoning older Americans seeking more adventure than Europe
and hoping to see a fragile frontierland visited by only a
privileged few in their youth.
</P>
<P>
They are fueling fresh growth in the adventure travel industry,
an estimated $1.3 billion-a-year phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
About 800 American tourists traveled to Antarctica in 1988,
3,000 in 1989, and tour operators expect at least 4,000 in the
December-February summer season. Manheim says it could reach 5,000.
``There's clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary
visits to remote places in the world,'' said Manheim.
</P>
<P>
He filed an appeal Tuesday with the government urging more
regulation.
``We are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to
Antarctica, we just think tourism is something that has to be
regulated carefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Concern began mounting after the January 1989 grounding of the
Argentine naval ship Bahia Paraiso in which an estimated 175,000
gallons leaked into marine habitats, killing seals, penguins and
other marine life. The vessel remains at the site off Palmer
Station with some oil in its tanks.
</P>
<P>
Particularly worrisome to critics are the plans of Ocean Cruise
Lines of Fort Lauderdale to send the largest cruise ship in years
to Antarctica, the 460-passenger Ocean Princess.
</P>
<P>
Rates begin at $3,895 per person for a double-occupancy cabin on
its three wine-and-caviar cruises, which are selling briskly. The
first round trip from Buenos Aires, Argentina, begins Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
Manheim's appeal is urging the government to place strict
controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on
tourist observation of penguins and seals, and coordination of
cruise ship visits to breeding grounds.
</P>
<P>
He said ships had made repeated tourist visits to the same
wildlife sites, disrupting the breeding of seals, penguins and
other birds.
``A year after Antarctica's most significant environmental
disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar
catastrophes,'' said Manheim.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government responds that effective regulations are
already in place.
``We have tried, and we believed we have dealt succesfully with
the explosion of Antarctica tourism,'' said Jack Talmadge of the
National Science Foundation, which regulates U.S. activities in
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Talmadge said the NSF has issued tourist regulations,
established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and
taken steps to limit visits to U.S. research stations.
</P>
<P>
He said the tour operators are also cooperating with the NSF to
minimize the impact of tourism, including giving advance notice of
ship visits.
</P>
<P>
Although 16 nations fly flags in Antactica and seven claim
slices of it, no nation holds title to the continent, which is
larger than the United States and Mexico combined.
</P>
<P>
Military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists
have been frequent modes of travel to Antarctica since the first
tourists visited in 1958.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Chilean government has opened a spartan hotel at its
Teniente Marsh Station on King George island, and LanChile airlines
began commercial flights to that Antarctic stop last year.
</P>
<P>
Australian entrepreneurs have proposed a five-story hotel,
airstrip and hovercraft dock. The Canada-based Adventure Network
currently flies tourists to one South Pole station.
</P>
<P>
But the bulk of the tourists are Americans brought in by
U.S.-based operators. Conservationists say the United States should
therefore take the lead in adopting a model regulatory policy.
``Antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the United
States, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our
tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international
level,'' said Manheim.
</P>
<P>
Operators of the Ocean Cruise Lines said there is no cause for
alarm.
``The tourist visiting Antarctica is a determined
environmentalist, an avid lover of wildlife, and I can assure you
that no tourist _ not one _ has hurt or killed a bird or animal,''
said Lars Eric Lindblad, an Antarctic travel pioneer who will
lecture aboard the Ocean Princess.
</P>
<P>
James Barnes, with Friends of the Earth in Washington, concludes
that the travelers may leave their footprints, but they often
return home more committed environmentalists _ ``Ambassadors of
Antarctica.''
Nonetheless, he said, ``The scale of these activities is growing
at such a pace that it does provide cause for concern.''

U.S., BRITAIN REBUFF BID TO RESERVE ANTARCTICA FOR WILDLIFE 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PARIS 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain and the United States have kept their hopes of issuing mining licenses 
in the Antarctic alive by refusing to accept proposals to turn the continent 
into a wildlife reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve days of talks here among the 39 Antarctic Treaty nations, discussions 
dominated by the mining issue, broke up Friday night with a wide division 
between the pro- and anti-mining nations. 
</P>
<P>
Australia and France had proposed that Antarctica be turned into a wilderness 
park and that the Minerals Convention of 1988, which took six years to 
negotiate, be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States refused to discuss this proposal and insisted 
that the conference should talk about implementing the convention and discuss 
clauses that would apportion liability in the case of mining pollution. The 
Minerals Convention creates a framework for mining under strict environmental 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the conference, it was decided to hold another two meetings in 
Chile next year. One would discuss comprehensive environmental issues for the 
Antarctic and the second would talk about accident liability clauses for 
minerals. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides refused to compromise but were aware that walking out of the meeting 
would have destroyed the Antarctic Treaty system that has controlled the region 
for 30 years, prevented armed conflict and promoted scientific cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
John Heap, head of Britain's delegation, said London is not prepared to discuss 
the wilderness park idea if it excludes all mining. 
</P>
<P>
"The last great wilderness is the size of the United States and Europe put 
together," Heap said. "Is it inevitable that a mine site somewhere in 
Antarctica would despoil all Antarctica? I don't believe it is." 
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. representative Tucker Scully said that the meeting had agreed on 
other urgent practical steps to protect the environment, including tighter 
rules on marine pollution and waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Litter from the 9,000 scientists stationed on the icecap during the summer, 
plus an estimated 3,000 tourists each year, has already started to pollute the 
coasts where both people and wildlife cluster. 
</P>
<P>
French officials said the conference had been a failure because Britain and the 
United States had refused to discuss their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Barnes, from the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, representing 300 
environmental organizations, said that the wilderness park proposals were still 
on the table, something he said "gives us more time to push our case." 
</P>
<P>
"The tide is running our way," Barnes said. "We believe the minerals regime 
will never be implemented now, although it may take a long time to kill."

U.S. URGED TO LEAD IN SAVING ANTARCTIC; 
ENVIRONMENT: AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE WILL PROPOSE THAT THE CONTINENT BE 
DESIGNATED A WORLD SCIENCE PARK.

<P>
The United States risks losing an unusual opportunity to assert global 
leadership in protecting Antarctica, Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) said Thursday 
on the eve of an international conference on the future of the frozen 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
Gore spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Alliance for Antarctica, a 
coalition of environmental groups. It is calling on the United States and other 
nations participating in the conference, which begins Monday in Chile, to 
designate Antarctica as a world science park. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on 
parks and public land, said he fears that recurring degradation has made 
Antarctica "an environmental time bomb ready to explode." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no time for half-measures if America is to be the world's leader in 
protecting Antarctica," Vento said. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional legislation calling for preservation of Antarctica is awaiting 
President Bush's signature, but there has been speculation that the Interior 
Department might urge Bush to veto the measure. The legislation for the first 
time would apply U.S. environmental protection laws to any activity in 
Antarctica sponsored by an agency of the U.S. government. It also would 
prohibit U.S. exploration or development of minerals in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
The United States "should be leading the way and trying to protect the island 
instead of trying to protect the mineral convention," said Rep. Wayne Owens 
(D-Utah), who introduced the measure in the House. Gore was its Senate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of a dispute between Congress and the State Department is the 
ratification of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources 
Activities, on which the State Department has worked for six years. 
</P>
<P>
The convention, signed two years ago but not ratified by 17 of 20 nations, 
would regulate mineral exploration but not ban it, as the congressional action 
would. The French and Australian governments are now against the accord, saying 
that no international agreement that would endorse even strictly regulated 
exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources could be acceptable to either 
government. If all 20 nations do not ratify the pact, it is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Mining in the Antarctic is not compatible with the protection of the 
continent's fragile environment, many environmentalists contend. French 
oceanologist Jacques Cousteau, in an interview with the New York Times last 
year, declared that an oil spill in the Antarctic could damage the food chain 
for decades and affect the entire hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
But Tucker Scully, director of the office of ocean affairs at the State 
Department and the lead U.S. negotiator for Antarctic issues, disagreed with 
the hands-off approach to the continent. "Creating a world park is to stick 
one's head in the sand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to environmentalists, Antarctica is being marred by air pollution and 
tourist ships and threatened by mining. They also believe that the continent is 
being damaged by scientists who come to unlock its mysteries. They burn their 
garbage in pits and dump their junk in a landfill by the sea, they charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We treated Antarctica like a frontier town," said R. N. Andersen, the National 
Science Foundation's deputy general counsel. Congress has funded a five-year, 
$30-million program to clean up the Antarctic environment. More than 76 
scientific projects are now under way on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
During the peak summer months, about 4,000 people inhabit Antarctica, and 
tourism is increasing rapidly. Last year, about 3,000 people paid more than 
$10,000 each to photograph penguins and view the vast sweeps of ice and rock.

RATIFY THE 50-YEAR MORATORIUM ON MINING AND
DRILLING IN ANTARCTICA

<P>
IT has plenty of ice and penguins and krill, and the only thing endangered is
the ozone above it. So who cares if Arco or Shell sinks a few oil wells in
Antarctica? At least no NIMBYs would complain about derricks spoiling the
view.;    But oil exploration and mining would ruin Antarctica. Development
potentially would disrupt scientific research there, and put at unacceptable
risk an unparalleled ecosystem.  
</P>
<P>
At a just-concluded session in Madrid, Spain, 39 nations reached a
tentative compromise on updating the Antarctica Treaty.;    Washington,
dragging its feet all the way, needs steady pressure to accept the compromise.
</P>
<P>
While other nations - including Japan, Germany and New Zealand - pushed for
a permanent ban on commercial exploitation, U.S. and British delegates held
out for a short moratorium.;    Public pressure at home likely nudged the
holdouts to accept a 50-year moratorium on mining and mineral exploration. The
draft specifies that, when the moratorium expires, it may be lifted only with
approval of two-thirds of the signatories.;    Next month, the original
Antarctica Treaty will celebrate its 30th anniversary. What better way to
honor a model international agreement than to continue its tradition of
preserving Antarctica for scientific research, and keeping it off-limits to
military bases, commercial development and mining.;    Antarctica is as
pristine as environments come these days. With a climate harsher than the
Arctic's, it has less capacity for absorbing intervention and abuse.;    The
Earth endows us with a wealth worth vastly more than the artificial commodity
value of its resources. It may turn out that preserving Antarctica will reap
humankind more benefits than the yield from digging up and selling off all its
gold, silver and oil.

MCMURDO SOUND, Antarctica - Ward Testa is hunting for
seals.
</P>
<P>
He picks his way carefully through cracked ice where
others have fallen to their death. Ahead is his quarry - 20
female Weddell seals and their furry gray pups. Seeing him
approach, big stick in hand, they groan and try to scoot
away.
There is no escape. Fortunately for the furry creatures,
Dr. Testa is interested in seal science, not seal skins.
</P>
<P>
Today he's after urine samples, using a metal tube attached
to a stick. Soon he plans to bar-code the animals,
supermarket-style, with plastic tags on their flippers.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Testa, a bearded University of Alaska biologist, is
trying to learn why so many Antarctic seals starve every few
years. Maybe El Nino, an Equatorial storm system, alters
Antarctic currents, he muses, carrying the silverfish that
the seals feast on out of reach. "There's no mechanism that
can account for this," he says.
</P>
<P>
What drives Dr. Testa and hundreds of other researchers to
Antarctica each year is the hope of discovering a hidden
truth about the planet. It's a unique laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Antarctic science is science of the extremes. A continent
bigger than America, covered in ice more than a mile thick,
Antarctica is isolated by winds and currents that make it the
coldest, driest place on Earth. It is where scientists
discovered the ozone hole over the Earth in 1985, and where
they now hunt for clues to everything from global warming to
cosmic rays.
</P>
<P>
This is the story of three groups of scientific sleuths in
Antarctica: biologists studying the antifreeze systems of
fish; glaciologists examining whether the West Antarctic ice
sheet will break apart and flood the world; and cosmologists
searching for the birth of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
A Fish Story
If it's so cold in Antarctica, why don't the fish freeze?
</P>
<P>
Arthur DeVries has wondered why since his first visit here
in 1961. Seawater under the Ross Ice Shelf ranges from 28
degrees to 29.5 degrees - cold enough to freeze most fish as
hard as Mrs. Pauls's. (The water doesn't freeze at 32 degrees
because salt and pressure lowers its freezing point.) The
fish he hooked beneath the ice swam contentedly in tanks
filled with frigid water, but died when the water was warmed.
</P>
<P>
He had found his life's work.
</P>
<P>
Over the next seven years the biologist returned
repeatedly to Antarctica. He experimented with a family of
ugly gray and brown fish, called "notothenioidei," that
thrive in the waters here. After dissecting hundreds of them
and analyzing their blood, he learned they produce an
antifreeze molecule that lowers their freezing point just
enough to survive. "They live at the edge of freezing," he
says.
</P>
<P>
Now 52, with a graying walrus mustache and walrus girth,
Dr. DeVries is one of the last of the old Antarctic hands
still conducting research "on the ice," as the place is
called here.
</P>
<P>
Dr. DeVries became a pioneer in cryobiology - the study
of the effects of extremely low temperatures on living
things. He and his colleagues found a half-dozen different
fish that produce antifreeze. A former grad student, Jack
Duman of Notre Dame, found antifreeze proteins in Midwestern
beetles, spiders and dandelions. Cryobiologists dream of
using antifreeze to preserve hearts for transplants, or
making freeze-resistant orange groves.
</P>
<P>
Among the results of Dr. DeVries's yearly three-month
stints here are two divorces. His third wife, biologist Chris
Cheng, collaborates with him at their base at the University
of Illinois, trying to isolate the fish gene that makes
antifreeze proteins.
</P>
<P>
Dr. DeVries calculates that fish antifreeze is 200 times
more effective than an equal amount of Prestone, but he can't
figure out why. Somehow, the antifreeze binds to tiny ice
crystals that the fish swallow as they swim.
</P>
<P>
One sunny afternoon in November, Dr. DeVries and Joseph
Eastman, a longtime associate who teaches at Miami University
in Ohio, fish through a hole in the ice. That night, they
dissect a few dozen small "notothenioidei" and place their
organs in test tubes filled with seawater. They want to see
if ice collects in fish organs, and if it does, how the
organs and antifreeze keep the ice in check.
</P>
<P>
The next afternoon at McMurdo's aquarium, a blue metal
shack with six big holding tanks, Dr. DeVries takes a small
fish and puts it in a bath chilled to 19 degrees - well
below the temperature fish antifreeze works at. The fish
convulses, then stiffens, its eyes turn gray with ice. The
ice inside the fish had grown explosively at the lower
temperature, Dr. DeVries explains, wrecking the fish's
nervous system and cells.
</P>
<P>
He repeats the test with each fish organ. The heart, "No
ice," he tells a young scientist taking notes. "Liver, no
ice. Ovaries, no ice. Blood, no ice." Finally, he dips a test
tube with a red spleen into the bath. It quickly becomes
encased in ice. The ice collector is found.
</P>
<P>
But so is a new mystery. Ice buildup should overload the
spleen and kill the fish, he says, but it doesn't. He
speculates there may be a kind of "hot spot" in the fish,
that melts ice crystals. "There's still so much to do," he
sighs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canadian scientists are trying to breed salmon
with antifreeze genes so the fish can flourish in the icy
waters off Nova Scotia. DNA Plant Technology Corp. in
Cinnaminson, N.J., is testing tomatoes implanted with
antifreeze genes to see if they better withstand freezing and
thawing. General Foods has experimented with fish antifreeze
to see if it can prevent ice crystals from ruining ice cream
that's left out of the freezer and put back melted.
</P>
<P>
But none of the research has panned out yet, and Dr.
</P>
<P>
DeVries is deeply skeptical it will until scientists
understand better how fish and their antifreeze work.
</P>
<P>
The Great Flood Watch
Robert Bindschadler sits in his dorm room at McMurdo - a
place with the charm of a trailer park. He's staring at
satellite photos that may foretell the fate of hundreds of
millions of people.
</P>
<P>
The photos don't look dramatic. Just a field of ice marked
by ripples and bumps, revealing crevasses and shifting ice.
</P>
<P>
The markings also show the immense forces of nature shaping
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Four groups of glaciologists are setting up camp in West
Antarctica to see whether the ice sheet there - a hunk of
ice as big as Greenland - is beginning to collapse. If so,
sea level would rise so quickly that, within decades, some
coastal areas would lose 10 feet of shoreline a year. "Then,
it's curtains for Bangladesh," says Ohio State glaciologist,
Ian Whillans.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bindschadler, a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration glaciologist, points to tracks on his photos
that mark the mouth of two huge streams, 30 miles wide, of
solid ice. He plans to drive stakes into the ice along a
90-mile line just below the mouth, and come back two years
later to see how far the stakes have moved. Some ice streams
move a half mile a year, pulling ice from Antarctica's
interior to the sea. There it breaks into icebergs.
</P>
<P>
By comparing the outflow of ice with measurements of snow
accumulation in the interior, scientists can calculate
whether the ice sheet is shedding ice. If so, they warn, a
cataclysmic cycle may be underway. The thinner the ice sheet
gets, the faster the ice streams will flow. And the faster
the ice streams flow, the thinner the ice sheet gets, until,
eventually, it collapses. Then, "prepare for the worst," says
Dr. Bindschadler.
</P>
<P>
Just 20 years ago, the threat of a great flood from a
melting Antarctica was the stuff of supermarket tabloids. But
after experiments on two ice streams in the mid-1980s, even
former skeptics began taking the threat seriously. Scientists
found that the streams changed speed and direction rapidly -
showing the ice sheet as far more unpredictable than
imagined. And they found 500,000-year-old marine fossils
under the ice, indicating the ice sheet had melted before
when the Earth had warmed.
</P>
<P>
If the ice sheet is melting, humans probably aren't to
blame. Glaciologists say Antarctica is responding to the
long-term warming of the Earth since the last ice age 18,000
years ago, and to the weird geology of the frozen continent.
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the half-mile thick ice sheets slide
along a layer of mud. But occasionally the ice stream rolls
over a patch of dry rock - a "sticky spot," says the
University of Wisconsin's Charles Bentley. That stops the ice
cold. Dr. Bentley figures that one ice stream he has studied
hasn't moved much since it hit a sticky spot during the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
This year, Dr. Bentley will hunt for sticky spots using
radar. He and his team plan to lay out 10 rectangular grids,
each consisting of 1,000 bamboo poles jammed into the snow
atop an ice stream. Then they will use a big tracked vehicle
to lug a radar antenna up and down the grid, looking for
radar patterns that signal a hard surface below.
</P>
<P>
"Things are changing rapidly, and we don't have ways to
predict the future" of the ice sheet, Dr. Bentley says.
</P>
<P>
Hidden in the snows of Antarctica are some clues.
</P>
<P>
A Cosmic Quest
Just how cold is it at the South Pole?
- So cold they put heaters in walk-in refrigerators to
keep beer from freezing.
- So cold that most all the water vapor freezes, making
the Polar atmosphere drier than the Sahara's.
</P>
<P>
The latter explains why two groups of cosmologists have
come to the South Pole in November - springtime in
Antarctica - when temperatures warm to 50 degrees below zero
and 30-mile-per hour winds blow. This is the best place on
Earth for studying the heavens, they explain, because the
drier the air, the better their telescopes can see the cosmic
radiation that bathes the planet.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe the radiation was produced about
500,000 years after the birth of the universe and is the key
to understanding the central paradox of cosmology. If the Big
Bang sent energy and matter hurtling outward uniformly in all
directions, how did stuff ever clump together, through
gravity, to form the galaxies and stars we see today?
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in the sky, the cosmic radiation must either be
more intense or hotter than other places - marking sites
where galaxies formed.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise it's all magic," says George Smoot. Dr. Smoot,
a 45-year-old blithe spirit from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
in California, leads a team of scientists from the West Coast
and Italy. Jeffrey Peterson, 36, leads the other team, from
Princeton University and several East Coast labs. The team
that finds the signal in the cosmic radiation that shows
galaxy formation - or proves that a signal doesn't exist -
will have found the Holy Grail of cosmology.
</P>
<P>
The Princeton team has come to the Pole every other year
since 1986. Every trip has brought calamity. The first year
they ran out of liquid helium to cool the telescope. In 1988,
their telescope broke as often as an old Ford. In 1990, they
ran out of liquid nitrogen, another coolant; this was the
only year they got any useful data, but just about half of
what they wanted. In 1991, a new government storage tank of
liquid nitrogen was supposed to supply the team, but one
night it exploded, shattering in two.
</P>
<P>
The Berkeley team is having better luck. In 1989, the
team's telescope found an energy source powerful enough,
perhaps, to account for the birth of galaxies - and now
they're back to make sure their measurements weren't
mistaken. Antarctica, they say, is Earth's clearest window to
the cosmos.

   As the Cold War Ends, Many Nations
   Are Cutting Their Antarctica Research

<P>
When the 26 nations with interests in Antarctica recently
agreed to ban mining and oil drilling on the frozen continent
for at least 50 years, environmentalists rejoiced.
</P>
<P>
But now scientists and Antarctic administrators think the
pact could backfire. Without any prospect of exploiting the
potential riches hidden beneath the ice, they say, many
nations may conclude Antarctic research isn't worth the
money.
"Many countries will resign their activities in Antarctica
{because} there is no hope of profits in the near future,"
says Krzyzstof Filcek, a Polish ecologist who studies
Antarctic marine life.
</P>
<P>
With the demise of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold
War and worsening economic problems, former East Bloc
countries are slashing Antarctic research budgets. Four of
nine Soviet research stations, which were strategically
placed around the continent to act as markers for future
claims, have been closed. Poland, noted for Antarctic marine
biology, has managed to staff its Arctowski base with just 14
scientists and workers - about one-fourth its usual
complement - and has cut back programs in meteorology and
geology.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., Antarctic budgets have been rising steadily,
mostly to pay for logistics. But the National Science
Foundation, which runs U.S. bases, thinks that the
government's commitment to Antarctica will wane, what with
new restrictions on mineral development and declining Soviet
competition. "We've been living on a tripod-geopolitics,
future uses of Antarctica and research," says Guy Guthridge,
an NSF Antarctic spokesman. "Now two of the three legs have
been taken away from us."
The U.S. Navy, for instance, regularly pays for about
one-fourth of all oceanographic research, much of it centered
on the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. But with the
end of the Cold War, the military may cut back because "there
is no enemy," Columbia University oceanographer Arnold Gordon
fears. This year, after a budget battle, more money was
appropriated for U.S. Antarctica research, partly by
redirecting funds earmarked for housing for the poor.
</P>
<P>
Such environmentalists as Jacques Cousteau campaigned for
the Antarctic minerals ban so Antarctica could be used as an
environmental laboratory to study the ozone layer, global
warming and pollution. But a major reason the number of
Antarctic research bases doubled to 68 over the past 20 years
had little to do with science. It "was politically inspired,"
says Alfred Fowler, head of the Council of Managers of
National Antarctic Program. Countries "wanted a seat around
the table" if there were mineral riches to divide, he says.
</P>
<P>
Proof of a nation's continuing interest in Antarctica is
that it supports scientists there. Nations realized they
needed a base to qualify for membership in the treaty system
that governs Antarctica, which was up for renegotiation this
year.
</P>
<P>
During those negotiations, Australia, New Zealand and
France, responding to environmental concerns, blocked an
agreement that would have permitted nations to survey
Antarctica for minerals and oil - even though the pact would
have set difficult hurdles before development could begin.
</P>
<P>
Instead, in October, the Antarctic treaty nations approved a
substitute that bars mineral and oil exploration for at least
50 years and requires environmental safeguards for research
bases.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the environmental provisions will make science
more expensive in Antarctica, already the costliest research
site apart from outer space. Of the $193 million the U.S.
plans to spend this fiscal year in Antarctica, only $22
million is budgeted for science. The rest is earmarked for
planes, ships and helicopters to ferry researchers; for other
logistics; and for environmental cleanup.
</P>
<P>
For many countries, the cost of Antarctic science is
already prohibitive. At Vostok station, famed for its studies
of ice cores that disclose ancient atmospheres, the Soviets
were so strapped for cash that they asked France to pay the
salaries of Soviet workers as part of an international
program. The French refused, say Antarctic scientists, but
agreed to pay for scientific instruments for the Soviets
instead.
</P>
<P>
Stanislaw Rakusa-Suszczewski, who runs the Polish
Antarctic program, says he has tried to persuade Hungary and
Czechoslovakia to chip in enough money to make Arctowski a
"post-Communist country" base, but to no avail. "I must look
for another partner," he says. "Maybe Ukraine?"
The countries with the strongest commitment to Antarctica
may turn out to be the ones that are tied to the continent by
nationalism, not science. Argentina and Chile claim parts of
Antarctica as extensions of their countries, even though the
Antarctic Treaty effectively makes the continent
international territory. They bring families to live in
Antarctica, not just scientists, encourage women to give
birth at their bases and postmark letters there - all to
back claims of sovereignty.
`They call them true settlements, not artificial science
bases," says Jack Child, an American University expert on the
region.

Will Steger, five other men and 36 dogs crossed Antarctica
in 1989-90. They advertised their derring-do as a showcase
for sponsors' equipment, a demonstration of international
cooperation, an educational enterprise and a way of drawing
attention to Antarctica and its environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Before all those goals, however, came "making it." And it
was surely the cooperative cleaving to that central purpose
that brought him and his companions through in the face of
considerable suffering and discouragement.
The Trans-Antarctica Expedition Mr. Steger writes about in
"Crossing Antarctica" (Knopf, 304 pages, $25) was born of the
ambitions of Mr. Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne, who met in
1986 in the middle of separate arctic journeys. Mr. Steger
was leading the first confirmed unsupported dog-sled
expedition to the North Pole and Dr. Etienne was making the
first solo ski there. They met in Mr. Steger's tent, shared
tea and their Antarctic dreams and exchanged phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
But why would anyone back a trip to the South Pole, where
all the firsts seemed to have been garnered long ago?
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Roald Amundsen had been there first, followed a
month later by British Royal Navy Capt. Robert Scott in
December and January of 1911-12. More Britishers had crossed
Antarctica with tracked vehicles in 1958 and 1981. Another
trio had skied "in the footsteps of Scott" in 1986. What was
left? In answer, Messrs. Steger and Etienne decided to ski
and dog-sled across the continent by the longest possible
route, a trek that took them from July 27 until March 3.
</P>
<P>
The success of Trans-Antarctica owed a lot to the pride,
resilience, determination and widely different skills and
personalities of the men involved: Geoff Somers, stubborn,
taciturn and wryly humorous, an expert dog-sled driver and
veteran of the British Antarctic Survey; Victor Boyarsky, a
boisterous, mercurial, Soviet glaciologist; Keizo Funatsu, a
quiet, conscientious Japanese with spiritual reserves,
devoted to his dogs; and Qin Dahe, a dedicated Chinese
scientist.
</P>
<P>
When I traveled with these men and their dog teams for
three days in the Minnesota wilderness in February 1989, it
was Mr. Qin's first experience with skis, sled dogs or
communicating at length in the English language. Clearly no
athlete, his command of all three was shaky. None of that
bothered Mr. Steger, who was more interested in Mr. Qin's
fierce determination to share camp chores and pull his weight
in subzero cold. "Dahe will do well," Mr. Steger decided, a
judgment vindicated over 3,741 miles in windchills sometimes
approaching minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Steger is also a keen judge of dogs, who share equally
in the credit for Trans-Antarctica. Because their lives
depended on the dogs, the men knew them all intimately, their
strengths and foibles. They were inspired by their canine
colleagues and despaired when they sometimes wilted from
exhaustion. The death en route of Tim, half wolf, became the
focus of a rift between Messrs. Steger and Somers.
</P>
<P>
The hardships that the party faced were tremendous, but
familiar polar fare. Men and dogs stumbled forward in snowy
whiteouts, fell into and rescued one another from crevasses.
</P>
<P>
Storms slowed them early and confined them to their tents for
days on the Antarctic Peninsula and buried some food caches
irretrievably under drifts of snow, gravely imperiling the
expedition. Bone-chilling head winds froze painful cracks in
their fingers and faces, sapping the strength of men and
dogs. Within 16 miles of the end, Mr. Funatsu stepped out in
a storm to tend his dog team and couldn't find his way back.
</P>
<P>
Feared dead, he was found 13 hours later, 300 feet from his
tent near a ditch he had scraped in the snow with a pair of
pliers.
</P>
<P>
Trans-Antarctica faced such problems with a different
style than Amundsen, Scott, Ernest Shackleton and explorers
who traveled in an age when leaders gave orders and the rest
followed. Amundsen consulted his teammates but his leadership
was authoritarian, and the Scott expedition followed Royal
Navy traditions of command. Mr. Steger is a leader of a
different stripe: experienced, laid back, determined and
flexible. "Those who get into trouble in places like
Antarctica," he writes, "are those who . . . fall back on a
stringent system, either philosophical or physical. You must
be willing to bend. You cannot allow nature, or an
undertaking, to imprison you, no matter its rigors."
As polar literature, Mr. Steger's account, written with
Jon Bowermaster, cannot equal the technical fascination of
Amundsen's "The South Pole." Nor can it approach the tragic
drama of Apsley Cherry-Garrard's "The Worst Journey in the
World," which recounts the death of Scott's party after much
agony only 11 miles from a cache of food and fuel. The
photographs are good, but lack the breathtaking scenery of "A
Walk to the Pole" by Roger Mear and Robert Swan.
</P>
<P>
"Crossing Antarctica" succeeds, however, as a clear and
factual account of modern man pitting himself against the
elements, bending before the blast, suffering, sacrificing,
enduring and prevailing.
