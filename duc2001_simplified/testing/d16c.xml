Strong Earthquakes Rock Japan and Philippines
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Separate strong earthquakes rocked northern Japan
and the main Philippine island of Luzon today, swaying buildings
and trees but apparently not causing any serious injuries or
damage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese quake registered a preliminary 5.2 on the Richter
scale and was the second strong temblor to hit the northern island
of Hokkaido in less than three days, Central Meteorological Agency
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said it struck at 7:44 a.m. (6:44 p.m. Sunday) and was
centered in the Hidaka mountain range, 45 miles away from
Saturday's earthquake, which measured a preliminary 6.4 on the
scale. Local police said there were no immediate reports of damage
or casualties.
</P>
<P>
The pre-dawn Philippine earthquake struck at 3:45 a.m. (3:55
p.m. Sunday) and registered a preliminary 5.4 Richter reading, the
Royal Observatory of Hong Kong said. The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology said it was centered 110 miles northwest
of Manila under the Luzon Sea.
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes measuring 5 on the open-ended Richter scale are
classified as strong and capable of causing considerable damage in
populated areas. However, both quakes were located deep below the
earth's surface and therefore caused little damage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Both earthquakes also occurred in quake-prone areas where edges
of the earth's crustal plates are thought to rub together, a
Central Meteorological Agency official said.
``It's been some time since we had earthquake activity in that
area of Hokkaido, so it's not surprising to have some now caused by
a build-up of pressure between the plates,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The official said there was no way of knowing whether the
Japanese quake was related to the one in the Philippines, 2,250
miles away.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine islands are thought to be located on the edge of
a separate, smaller crustal plate which extends up to southern
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Institute spokesman Ulpiano Trillanes said the Philippine
earthquake affected a wide area of Luzon island, including Manila,
but apparently caused no serious damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
In the past 35 years there have been two major earthquakes in
Hokkaido. In 1968, the Tokachi-Oki earthquake measuring a 7.9 on
the Richter scale killed 52 people.
</P>
<P>
The Richter scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Every increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold
increase in magnitude, thus a reading of 4.5 would be 10 times
stronger than one of 5.5.

A predawn earthquake in Soviet Central Asia
unleashed a 50-foot-high wall of dirt and mud that buried a mountain
village and swept through at least two others Monday, killing up to
1,000 people as they slept, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The devastating earthquake in the republic of Tadzhikistan was
the second to strike the Soviet Union in two months.
``Almost everybody died,'' Zainiddin Nasreddinov, editor-in-chief
of Tadzhikistan's official news agency, said by telephone after
visiting the wrecked farming settlement of Sharora. He estimated the
number of dead there alone at 600.
</P>
<P>
Sharora ``had more than 150 peasant households before that tragic
moment,'' the Soviet news agency Tass reported. ``Now most of it is
razed to the ground by the ruthless force of the natural calamity.''
Tass said the number of dead in the disaster zone 1,800 miles
southeast of Moscow was estimated at 1,000, but cautioned that was a
preliminary figure.
``Rescue work is being continued and distant mountain villages
have not been checked yet,'' Tass said. Damaged roads were hampering
those efforts.
</P>
<P>
The quake struck the southwestern part of Tadzhikistan, a Soviet
republic of more than 4.8 million people that borders Afghanistan
and China.
</P>
<P>
The 40-second tremor, at 5:02 a.m. (6:02 p.m. EST Sunday) was
centered about 20 to 30 miles southwest of Tadzhikistan's capital of
Dushanbe, a city of more than 460,000 people, in the fertile Gissar
district, a center of grapegrowing and livestock-raising, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
An official at Dushanbe's seismic center said the quake was
strong enough to knock things off shelves in tall apartment
buildings in the city, but that it caused no known damage or
injuries there. He declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va., estimated the quake at
5.4 on the Richter scale, which measures ground motion as recorded
on a seismograph. The Dec. 7 earthquake in northwestern Armenia,
1,300 miles west of Dushanbe, registered a 6.9 on the Richter scale
and killed 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake unhinged a wall of sodden dirt and mud at least
five miles wide that buried the village of Okuli-Bolo and much of
Sharora, said Erkin Kasimov, an official of Tadzhikistan's Foreign
Ministry.
``Almost all of the victims died asleep in their beds,'' Police
Maj. Alexander Loparev, duty officer at Tadzhikistan Interior
Ministry headquarters in Dushanbe said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Residents of another village, Okuli-Poyen, apparently roused in
time, fled in panic before the mudslide, which traveled 1\ to 1{
miles, could reach their homes, Kasimov said from Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
Officials and Soviet media said the devastation was vast, and
total in places.
</P>
<P>
In Okuli-Bolo and Okuli-Poyen, near the epicenter, ``everything
is destroyed _ all the homes, the schools, the hospitals and
clinics, the stores,'' Nasreddinov said.
</P>
<P>
Okuli-Bolo is a ``heap of rubble'' and the chairman of a local
economic cooperative, Hairrulo Yuldashev, said the households of 70
peasant families were ``completely demolished and buried by the
landslide,'' Tass said. More than 70 villagers were buried by the
landslide, it said.
</P>
<P>
In Sharora, ``cries and wails can be heard everwhere,'' Tass
reported. ``Some are bemoaning and burying their near and dear ones,
while others are trying to find the few survivors between the thick
layer of sand and clay.''
It said all of the village's streets had been buried under the
50-foot-high layer of earth that the earthquake detached from a hill
near the village.
</P>
<P>
The TV news program ``Vremya'' showed aerial footage of Sharora,
with white roofs of buried homes peeking through the dirt like
seashells scattered on a beach.
</P>
<P>
Kasimov said that according to preliminary figures, the quake and
landslide destroyed about 100 buildings, including five schools and
a maternity hospital near the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
The hospital was evacuated of mothers and newborns before the
wall of mud arrived and there were no victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
There was no exact count available for the population of the
stricken villages. But the official at the Dushanbe seismic center
said families are traditionally large in the mostly Moslem republic,
and that one dwelling often houses eight to 10 people.
</P>
<P>
The quake and landslide downed three miles of power lines,
destroyed nine miles of telephone lines and inundated four miles of
a navigation canal with mud, Kasimov said.
``Thousands of head of publicly owned cattle have perished,''
Tass said. It said thousands of acres of fertile farmland were
covered ``by a thick layer of sand and clay.''
Nasreddinov said the buildings destroyed were one-story brick
structures. Soldiers went to the villages to keep order and restore
communications, electricity and water, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kasimov said geologists believed water from mountain springs had
accumulated under the soil of the hills in the Gissar region, making
them prone to mudslides.
``When the earthquake came, it was like a catapult, and it hurled
the sodden earth onto the villages below,'' Kasimov said.
</P>
<P>
Tass said bulldozers, cranes and excavators had been rushed to
the quake zone to help dig for survivors, and that volunteers had
come from Dushanbe and other nearby areas to help in rescue and
relief.
</P>
<P>
Equipment, food and fuel were also sent to the scene, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
On ``Vremya,'' a statement of condolences from the Kremlin
leadership was read, and aid promised from the national government.
</P>
<P>
According to Nasreddinov, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev telephoned
Tadzhikistan officials to promise Moscow's help.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said he knew of no request for assistance from the Soviets. ``Our
sympathy certainly goes out again to the victims of this most recent
earthquake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The experience of the Armenian earthquake shows the death toll in
Tadzhikistan could be much higher than the first estimates. Soviet
officials, including Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnaze,
initially spoke of ``thousands'' of victims in the Armenian quake.
</P>
<P>
Kremlin spokesmen later estimated 55,000 people had been killed, but
on Dec. 29, Armenian officials gave what they called an accurate
death toll of 25,000.

Death Toll Triples Average in 1988 Earthquakes
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The earthquake that killed 25,000 people in
Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide
to the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed at
least 10 times as many, the U.S. Geological Survey reports.
</P>
<P>
The estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an
additional 2,000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around
the world, the Survey reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the annual average death toll for earthquakes is about
10,000, in 1987 only 1,100 lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the deaths, some 13,000 people were injured and
more than a half-million were left homeless in the Armenian
earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale. The
death toll of 25,000 is the most recent reported by the Soviets. The
exact toll in unknown.
</P>
<P>
The main shock was followed within minutes by a second, measuring
5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energy released by an
earthquake. An earthquake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage, and
the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale.
</P>
<P>
Many of the deaths in Armenia were blamed on collapsing
buildings, as the earthquake rattled concrete structures until they
fell to the ground, according to subsequent analyses.
</P>
<P>
Another recent earthquake in the Soviet Union, claiming about
1,000 lives, struck in Soviet central Asia. That one occurred in
January, however, and so does not count in the 1988 toll.
</P>
<P>
Last year's second most deadly earthquake occurred Aug. 20 on the
Nepal-India border, killing 1,000. That earthquake, measuring 6.6 on
the Richter scale, destroyed thousands of homes and injured many
people.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 6 an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730
lives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma and
China, the Geological Survey reported.
</P>
<P>
And on the India-Burma border three deaths were reported in an
Aug. 6 earthquake that caused landslides.
</P>
<P>
The Survey said it recorded 61 significant earthquakes last year,
15 fewer than the year before. An earthquake is considered
significant if it has a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes of lesser magnitude are included if they cause
casualties or considerable damage.
</P>
<P>
Three significant earthquakes were recorded in the United States
last year, including the strongest shock of the year. That
earthquake, measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska
and resulted in only minor damage.
</P>
<P>
The only U.S. earthquake death last year occured when someone
suffered a heart attack after an earthquake measuring 4.8 in
Whittier, Calif., in February. The other significant U.S. earthquake
occurred Dec. 3 in Pasadena, Calif. It was measured at 4.6 on the
scale and caused some injuries and property damage.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake centered in eastern Canada on Nov. 25 was felt
widely across that country and in the northeastern United States as
far south as Washington, the Survey reported. It had a magnitude of
5.7. Earthquakes in the eastern part of North America tend to be
felt over larger areas than earthquakes of similar strength in the
West.
</P>
<P>
Europe recorded three earthquake deaths last year when one rated
at 3.0 killed a group of miners in Czechoslovakia on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
In addition an earthquake rated at 5.8 caused several injuries in
Albania on Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
Injuries were also reported from two offshore earthquakes, one in
the Ionian Sea near Greece Oct. 16 and another near the Azores
Islands Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, eight people working in a gold mine in South Africa
died Jan. 5 in an earthquake rated at 5.2.
</P>
<P>
And Japan, usually very seismically active, recorded only one
significant earthquake last year, the Survey reported. That
earthquake measured 5.4 and resulted in 10 injuries and minor damage
in the Tokyo area.

Strong Quake Hits Caspian Sea Region
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strong earthquake shook the Caspian Sea
region of the Soviet Union and Iran before dawn Sunday, the third
relatively strong earthquake in the area since Tuesday, Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There was no word of casualties or damage from the quake centered
in Soviet Azerbaijan 250 miles northwest of Tehran, measuring 5.6 on
the Richter scale, said the agency monitored in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
An observatory in Hong Kong said the quake was centered in the
Caspian Sea about 120 miles northeast of the Azerbaijani capital and
port city of Baku and measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Tehran and other cities in
northern Iran were jolted by the earthquake registered by the Tehran
University Geophysics Center at 4:24 a.m. (8:54 p.m. EDT Saturday).
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported Saturday that an earthquake registering 5.5 on the
Richter scale shook the region Saturday. The U.S. Geological Survey
in Washington said that quake, also with an epicenter east of Baku,
registered 6.6.
</P>
<P>
Another tremor registering 5.2 shook the area around Gorgan, 185
miles east of Tehran on Tuesday, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Iran is shaken by hundreds of earthquakes a year, ranging from
2.4 to 5.5 on the Richter Scale. The last major earthquake,
registering 7.7, was in September 1978. It killed 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Richter scale is a measure of energy released by an
earthquake as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one whole
number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause serious damage
and one of 7 can cause widespread heavy damage.

<P>
A major earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter
scale struck off northeastern Honshu Island early today, officials
said. Three coastal villages were ordered evacuated for fear of
tidal waves, officials said.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the
quake, which struck at 3:26 a.m. Thursday (1:26 p.m. Wednesday
EST). It was centered about 60 miles off the coast and at a depth
of 20 miles, the Central Meteorological Agency in Tokyo said.
</P>
<P>
After the quake, officials closed the major expressway through
the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were
stopped to check the condition of the rails.
</P>
<P>
The agency warned of a tsunami, or seismic tidal wave, hitting
coastal towns on northeast Honshu and the northernmost main island
of Hokkaido. The agency said sea levels two hours after the quake
had risen nearly three feet in the region.
</P>
<P>
Officials ordered the evacuation of the villages of Taro,
Sanriku and Ozutsu, about 300 miles northeast of Tokyo on Honshu's
eastern coast.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the quake had a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter
scale, the same as the Oct. 17 earthquake that devastated the San
Francisco Bay area. In Washington, the U.S. Geological Survey said
the quake measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Geological Survey scientists said they recorded an
aftershock measuring 5.8 about 10 minutes after the main quake.
</P>
<P>
The main earthquake was the strongest in that region in more
than 58 years, since a magnitude 7.7 earthquake March 9, 1931, said
Don Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. agency.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake occurred in the same general area as a series of
earlier tremors during the past several weeks. The strongest of the
earlier quakes was a magnitude 6.5 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
</P>
<P>
Japan is situated on a major fault line that produces frequent
earthquakes, few of which cause serious damage.

Earthquake Hits Southern Sudan, But no Injuries or Damage
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major earthquake rumbled through the
jungles of southern Sudan on Sunday near the war-torn region's
largest city, but officials said there appeared to be no casualties
and little damage.
</P>
<P>
The quake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. A temblor of that
size is capable of causing widespread destruction.
</P>
<P>
The official Sudan News Agency said the earthquake caused no
deaths or injuries. But much of the area affected by the quake is
so isolated that any news might take days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
Juba, southern Sudan's largest city, is 60 miles southwest of
the quake's reported epicenter. The region has been hit by famine
as well as fighting between the government and the rebel People's
Liberation Army, and Juba is crammed with refugees from the
7-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
In Nairobi, Kenya, Bob Koepp, a Lutheran World Federation
official, said a pilot flying relief supplies to Juba returned late
Sunday and said the city had not been seriously affected. He said
there was some ``negligible'' damage.
``It wasn't very heavy at Juba. The epicenter apparently was in
the swamps and the ground may have just soaked it up,'' Koepp said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said the quake's epicenter was 700 miles south of
Sudan's capital, Khartoum. It occurred in sparsely populated
territory controlled by the rebels, who hold most of the southern
countryside.
</P>
<P>
Relief workers in two rebel-controlled villages, Bor and Torit,
apparently told officials in Nairobi, Kenya, the earthquake caused
no damage there.
``It's pretty low area over there, with low buildings and quite
remote,'' Koepp said.
</P>
<P>
A crew with Koepp's organization landed in the region with
relief supplies two hours after the quake struck at 4:22 a.m. and
reported seeing nothing amiss.
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, a Khartoum airport tower operator said flights to
the southern city had not been disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Pierre-Andre Conod of the International Committee of the Red
Cross said he had no details about injuries or damage. He said
colleagues in Juba had not made their regular radio contact with
Khartoum but cautioned that ``maybe they have a problem with the
antenna. We cannot say it is due to the earthquake.''
People seeking haven from the war and from famine have more than
doubled Juba's population of 125,000. In recent years, hundreds of
thousands have died in southern Sudan, an area the size of Texas.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's two principal earthquake monitoring stations, including
one at the Aswan High Dam, 600 miles south of Cairo and just north
of the Sudan border, recorded the quake at 7.5 on the Richter
scale. The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. reported an
identical reading.
``It's such a big quake that the monitoring stations are
saturated with data,'' said geologist Rashad M. Kebeasy, president
of Egypt's National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics.
``This is an extremely dangerous earthquake. It is the first time
that such a quake has struck this area.''
He said ``large and very dangerous aftershocks'' were to be
expected for the next two days.
</P>
<P>
The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every
increase of one number, say from magnitude 5.5 to magnitude 6.6,
means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.
</P>
<P>
A magnitude of 7 is considered a major earthquake capable of
widespread heavy damage. Magnitude 8 is a great earthquake capable
of tremendous damage. Last October's earthquake near San Francisco
registered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Kebeasy, an expert on earthquakes of northeastern Africa, said
the epicenter was just west of the Great African Rift. That
earthquake zone stretches 4,000 miles from Mozambique through the
Red Sea to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The proximity to the rift accounts for the quake's magnitude,
Kebeasy said.

The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought
reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake
in Armenia killed about 25,000 people. Most died in structures that
collapsed when the quake hit.
``It's very similar to what we had in Armenia,'' said Russ
Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but
Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7
according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the
fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after
midnight. Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a
ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
</P>
<P>
In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later
blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something
falling on top of you,'' said Needham in a telephone interview from
Golden, Colo.
</P>
<P>
The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are
built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an
earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.
</P>
<P>
The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that
area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said.
``Iran is in a very active seismic region,'' he said, and that
there have been many smaller quakes.
</P>
<P>
Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in
Iran during the last 30 years, Needham said.
</P>
<P>
A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable
of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

TOKYO 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Far beneath this modern metropolis, the powerful forces of nature are locked in 
a slow but deadly battle that will some day bring this great city to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
Already overcrowded and growing at a staggering rate, Tokyo sits on a deep 
sedimentary basin that is like a bowl of jello cradled by one of the most 
treacherous geological formations on the planet. Bluntly put, there are few 
places on Earth that are geologically less suited as a site for a great city 
than here on the shores of Tokyo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the giant slabs of the Earth's crust grind together here in what 
scientists call a "triple junction." Two of the plates sink beneath the islands 
of Japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the Earth directly 
below Tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed 
the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Most other earthquake-prone regions, including California, only have to worry 
about two colliding plates. 
</P>
<P>
The threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is 
being reclaimed from Tokyo Bay to serve the needs of millions more who are 
flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity. Scientists are 
concerned that land reclaimed from the bay will be particularly hazardous 
because such soils amplify shock waves from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Painfully aware of its problems, Japan is moving full speed ahead in earthquake 
engineering research, and the country is trying to develop the world's best 
earthquake warning system before the next great quake hits. But some experts 
believe Tokyo is already past due for a catastrophic quake, and scientists 
around the world are watching to see if Japan can win a race against time. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of a giant quake here could be felt around the world. Tokyo is a key 
player in global economics, and some officials fear that a catastrophic quake 
here could have a devastating effect elsewhere. Frank Press, president of the 
U.S. National Academy of Sciences, has speculated that a great quake here would 
force Japan to reclaim much of its foreign investment, possibly leading to a 
collapse of the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo was leveled once, in 1923, when a monstrous earthquake destroyed a city 
that had ignored the lessons offered in 1906 from a different city by a distant 
bay. "If we had understood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the damages from 
the Great Kanto Earthquake which came just 17 years later could have been 
avoided," says Hirokazu Iemura of Kyoto University's Earthquake Engineering 
Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Iemura, who toured the Bay Area after last October's quake, is afraid history 
may repeat itself. The recent San Francisco temblor, he said, demonstrated what 
scientists call "non-linear" consequences of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
That means that in some cases the earth may tremble far more than the magnitude 
of the quake would suggest. The Bay Area quake suggested that Tokyo too may be 
much more vulnerable than experts had thought. 
</P>
<P>
For this and other reasons, Tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
A study last year by Japan's National Land Agency concluded that if a great 
earthquake - magnitude 8 or greater - should strike Tokyo in the middle of 
the night it would kill about 80,000 people. If it came at lunch time, as it 
did in 1923, or in the evening when stoves would be lit for cooking and 
heating, fires would sweep through parts of the city and the death toll could 
reach 150,000. Many experts here think even those grim estimates are far too 
low. 
</P>
<P>
When the great quake strikes, as everyone here knows it must, it will hit a 
city that is already so crowded that on a typical day it dwarfs the worst 
traffic jams that Los Angeles has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread planning efforts, there will be few places for people to 
run, and it will be extremely difficult to reach safety even for those who know 
where to go. The danger will not be just from falling objects. It will be 
mainly from fire. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1923 earthquake, 100,000 people burned to death," Iemura said. That is 
more than twice as many as were killed directly by the 7.9 temblor. And now, 
all these years later, Iemura and many other experts in Japan are afraid that 
history may repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very afraid of fire," said Etsuzo Shima, professor emeritus at the 
University of Tokyo and one of Japan's leading earthquake experts. "We have 
many wooden houses and the roads are very narrow, and if there is a big fire in 
the region, many of them will be burned." 
</P>
<P>
Nario Oyagi, a geologist-engineer with Japan's National Research Center for 
Disaster Prevention, thinks Tokyo's congested streets pose a special problem. 
In his worst nightmares, he sees endless streams of cars ablaze on crowded 
streets, forming ribbons of fire extending out to the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Hampered by ruptured water lines, unable to move on the jammed streets, 
firefighters would be helpless, forced to witness a holocaust of unthinkable 
dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's Metropolitan Fire Department has estimated that fully one-third of the 
city could be destroyed by fire in a great quake. Japanese authorities are well 
aware of their peril, and have made dramatic progress in earthquake 
engineering. The modern buildings of Japan are among the best engineered in the 
world, and even many older structures are well built because earthquakes here 
are so much a part of life. 
</P>
<P>
But no amount of planning can reduce the geological hazard that lies beneath 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very complex place," said Yoshimitsu Okada, who is in charge of the 
most ambitious effort in the world to predict an earthquake. Okada directs a 
research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of 
Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. 
</P>
<P>
Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations 
beneath Japan are constantly active. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the 
planet. The plates slide against each other in some regions, like California, 
causing earthquakes. In other areas, an oceanic plate slides beneath a 
continental plate through subduction. The latter is the process that created 
the active volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The islands of Japan are on the Eurasia Plate, which is sliding up over two 
other plates, the giant Pacific Plate (which also grinds against California on 
its opposite side) and the Philippine Sea Plate. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippine and Pacific plates are being pushed under Japan as the powerful 
forces crunch together, creating volcanoes as they heat the underside of the 
Eurasia Plate. And unfortunately for Tokyo, directly beneath the mega-city, the 
two oceanic plates are colliding as they sink into the Earth's mantle. 
</P>
<P>
Temblors occur as the plates are ripped apart while being forced under the 
Eurasia Plate, so they strike much deeper than the shallow earthquakes in 
California. However, they can be quite large, well above magnitude 8, so they 
pose a great danger to areas on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the strength of an earthquake here is magnified by the geological 
conditions that underlie nearly the entire city of Tokyo. Like Los Angeles, 
Tokyo and many other cities in Japan are built on sedimentary deposits that 
have washed down from the mountains over millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
Those deposits have formed a huge sedimentary basin beneath what is now the 
city of Tokyo. In some cases, that basin is up to two miles thick. 
</P>
<P>
When an earthquake occurs, the waves of energy flowing from the epicenter are 
magnified by shifting sedimentary deposits, making the ground shaking more 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has an additional problem because the bedrock on which the sedimentary 
basin sits is shaped somewhat like a bowl. Shock waves striking the bedrock are 
reflected back up toward the surface, extending the life of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"The duration of the shaking is very long," said Oyagi, of the National 
Research Center for Disaster Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Officials here know those conditions could add up to disaster for Tokyo, a 
belief that was reinforced by Kyoto University's Iemura when he returned from 
his tour of the San Francisco Bay Area after the Oct. 17 quake. He has 
concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as 
Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 
9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts here had thought that Mexico City was an "exceptional case," 
Iemura said. The sprawling city is built on an ancient lake bed, and scientists 
believe it was particularly vulnerable to ground failure from liquefaction. 
That occurs when a shallow water table causes the loose sediments to assume the 
characteristics of a liquid during a large earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"This (liquefaction) had been thought of as very exceptional," Iemura said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bay Area quake demonstrated that liquefaction can occur "along the 
coast," as in San Francisco's Marina District, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico had been thought so exceptional there was no need to think about it," 
Iemura said. "But what about San Francisco? Is that also a special case?" 
</P>
<P>
Although he thinks the question needs more study, Iemura is troubled by the 
fact that much of Tokyo is built on areas similar to San Francisco's Marina 
District. 
</P>
<P>
And like San Francisco, Tokyo is extremely short of land on which to build the 
high rises needed to house the millions who continue to flock to this crowded 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the land shortage, Japanese authorities have concluded, is to 
reclaim more land from Tokyo Bay - a prospect that deeply troubles many 
experts. Many of the new structures going up in Tokyo these days are built on 
filled land, and some people here hope someday to fill in the entire bay, 
making room for even more people and more buildings. 
</P>
<P>
If San Francisco was not an "exceptional case," that trend could prove 
disastrous, many experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo University's Shima believes there is only one answer, and that is to 
reverse the flow of people into Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
One group is proposing that the capital be moved out of Tokyo, hoping that the 
forced move of government workers will result in a lower death toll when the 
quake hits. Local authorities are resisting that suggestion, but Shima insists 
that some people are now taking it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very afraid because we are now going to build a lot of high-rise 
buildings in the bay area," he said. "That will increase the population, and 
that's not so good." 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake hazards facing Tokyo are not just a local problem because Japan 
has become a major participant - some say the dominant player - in 
international economics. A devastating quake here would be felt in board rooms 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Experts believe insurance companies would be able to cover only a small 
percentage of the loss. The Japanese government has put a ceiling of around 
$60,000 on each private residence in a city where a humble abode costs 10 times 
that amount. 
</P>
<P>
And Tokyo is a major nerve center in the fragile network that constitutes the 
global economy. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DANGEROUS INTERSECTION 
</P>
<P>
Japan ranks among the most geologically active regions in the world. 
Earthquakes occur chiefly in areas where giant slabs of the Earth's crust, 
called tectonic plates, either grind past each other or crunch together in a 
process called "subduction" that forces one plate under another. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, however, has to concern itself with four plates. Most of the islands are 
on the giant Eurasia Plate, although the North American Plate reaches up over 
the Arctic and down to the northern tip of the archipelago. The Pacific and the 
Philippine Sea plates are being forced under the Eurasia Plate, and the two 
subducting plates collide directly beneath Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
That dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic 
earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, as well as about 
1,000 smaller quakes every month.
