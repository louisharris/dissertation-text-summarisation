  BUSH PICKS CONSERVATIVE BLACK TO FILL MARSHALL'S
SHOES ON COURT  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Monday nominated Clarence Thomas, a conservative Republican
with a controversial record on civil rights, to replace retiring Justice
Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.;    If confirmed, the 43-year-old
judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia would follow
Marshall as the second black to ascend to the court.  
</P>
<P>
But Thomas, who has risen in Republican ranks as an advocate of bootstrap
conservatism, would present a striking change from Marshall, a civil-rights
pioneer and an anchor of the court's declining liberal faction.;    Thomas,
barely half the age of the man whose seat he was named to fill, came of age in
the world that Marshall helped create.;    Now the question is to what extent
Thomas would add weight to the court's new majority that appears willing to
dismantle important parts of the legacy that Marshall helped to build.;   
While not much is known about Thomas' views on most issues likely to come
before the court, he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action and
to policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences.;
Opposes affirmative action;  In his year as a federal appeals court judge,
he has not ruled on affirmative action, but he has long been outspoken in
taking the position that government affirmative-action programs are not only
unwise but unconstitutional.;    However, in other respects, this nomination
is very much a wild card both for conservatives who jumped instantly to
embrace it and for liberals whose responses ranged from cautious to hostile.; 
His views on other major issues before the court, including abortion,
church-state relations and the definition of constitutional due process, are
unknown. Those views may well remain unknown through a confirmation process
that may be contentious but that in the end is not likely to derail the
nomination.;    Studied for priesthood;  Thomas attended Roman Catholic
schools through college and studied for the priesthood. Although the Catholic
Church vigorously opposes abortion, Thomas has apparently never taken a public
position on abortion or on the dimensions of the constitutional right to
privacy, on which the right to abortion was based.;    His position on
affirmative action is probably sufficient to shift the court's direction since
the court remains closely divided.;    "My opposition to preferences and
quotas not only is a constitutional, legal opposition, it has been a moral,
ethical opposition," he said five years ago at a conference sponsored by the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.;    In its most recent
affirmative-action decision, a year ago, the court split 5-4 in upholding a
Federal Communications Commission policy that gives preference to blacks and
members of other minorities in acquiring some radio and television licenses.; 
Justice William Brennan wrote that decision a few weeks before he retired
from the court. Marshall joined it. The views of Justice David Souter,
Brennan's successor, remain largely unknown.;    Views on big issues unknown; 
Thomas' views on the other major issues remain unknown, although the 1990
confirmation hearing for his seat on the Court of Appeals was widely viewed on
Capitol Hill and in ideological interest groups as a rehearsal for a Supreme
Court nomination.;    Some Democratic senators said at the time and again
Monday that their votes to confirm him for the appeals court should not be
taken as endorsements for the Supreme Court.;    Three years ago, the Senate
denied confirmation to Judge Robert Bork despite having voted to confirm him
only a few years earlier to the same court on which Thomas now sits.;   
Leaders of abortion rights groups said Monday that they would press the Senate
to deny confirmation to Thomas unless he expresses his support for the Supreme
Court's abortion precedents, including continued adherence to Roe vs. Wade,
the 1973 ruling that established the constitutional right to abortion.;   
Abortion faction speaks out;  "The Souter model of silence and evasion that we
saw last year is absolutely unacceptable," said Kate Michelman, executive
director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.;    Her reference was
to Souter's confirmation hearing last September, during which the nominee
gracefully but firmly deflected questions on abortion.;    Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee, endorsed
Michelman's position.;    "I'm through reading tea leaves and voting in the
dark," he said.;    But the Judiciary Committee includes some of the most
conservative Democrats in the Senate as well several combative Republican
conservatives. If Thomas maintains his silence, his nomination is unlikely to
founder on the abortion issue alone.;    Rights groups cautious;  Civil rights
groups took a cautious tone Monday, essentially noting "concerns" and saying
they would study the record.;    "We urge the Senate not to rush to judgment,"
said a statement from a Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an umbrella
group of 185 organizations that took an early and leading role in the defeat
of the Bork nomination.;    Introducing his nominee to the country at a
televised news conference Monday, Bush drew on the powerful appeal of Thomas'
life story as a self-motivated and self-made success.;    "Judge Thomas' life
is a model for all Americans," Bush said.;    At his side stood a black man
who was 5 years old when Marshall won his Supreme Court argument in Brown vs.
the Board of Education and who was a college freshman when Marshall joined the
Supreme Court.;    That was a generation ago, when the court was still
rewriting the ground rules by which Americans were to live their lives. Well
before Bush presented Thomas to the country Monday, it was clear that that
chapter in the court's history is largely closed and that a new page was about
to be turned. After Monday's nomination, some - but by no means all - of the
blanks on that page have been filled in.; CLARENCE THOMAS; Born: June 23,

  THOMAS FACES TOUGH SCRUTINY
DEMOS WANT ANSWERS ON THE DIVISIVE ISSUES  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senate Democrats promised today to scrutinize Supreme Court nominee Clarence
Thomas' views on abortion and other divisive issues. But Republicans said he
should not divulge his feelings about controversies that might come before the
court.;    "I'm satisfied that this man will pass muster," President Bush
declared Monday in naming Thomas to succeed retiring Justice Thurgood
Marshall. Conservatives applauded the selection and predicted liberals would
have trouble opposing the black judge.  
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the Senate Judiciary Committee, in
confirming four justices without learning how they felt about abortion, has
"given them a free ride" and should be tougher in ferreting out Thomas'
views.;    "The failure to give an answer may cause me and others to be
unwilling to vote for his confirmation," Metzenbaum said on "CBS This
Morning.";    Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., noted that Metzenbaum did not press
Justice David Souter during confirmation hearings about his position on
abortion. "I do not think it is appropriate to ask a nominee the ultimate
question as to how he is going to decide a specific case," Specter said.;   
"I will not support yet another Reagan-Bush Supreme Court nominee who remains
silent on a woman's right to choose, and then ascends to the court to weaken
that right," said Metzenbaum, the only member of the Judiciary Committee who
voted against Thomas' nomination to the Circuit Court of Appeals to the
District of Columbia.;    Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said on NBC's "Today" show
that "literally nobody nominated for the Supreme Court should give his or her
views with regard to cases that might come up in the future.";    But Sen.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said "in the past few months alone the Supreme Court is
throwing out past decisions, and I think it is legitimate to ask Judge Thomas,
what do you think of settled law, like Roe vs. Wade (legitimatizing abortion),
what do you think of a woman's right to privacy, free speech issues, issues of
freedom of religion.";    Civil rights groups have opposed Thomas on grounds
he was insensitive to the concerns of minorities and the elderly as chairman
of the federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in the 1980s.;   
"The fact that he is an African-American should not be a basis for avoiding
very careful scrutiny of his civil rights record," said Julius L. Chambers,
director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.;    While some
Democrats immediately blasted the nomination, the party's biggest guns held
their fire.;    Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
all promised a thorough review of the nomination.;    Confirmation hearings
are expected to begin after Congress' August recess.;    Thomas, 43, would
strengthen the 6-3 conservative majority on the nine member court. An
unabashed conservative, he would succeed the court's leading liberal - and
first and only black justice.;    Bush rejected suggestions that he chose
Thomas because he wanted to keep a black in that seat.;    "I kept my word to
the American people and to the Senate by picking the best man for the job on
the merits. And the fact he's minority, so much the better," Bush said at a
news conference outside his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine.;   
Potential opponents of the nominee promised in their statements to ignore
Thomas' race when they examine his record.;    "The background of Judge
Clarence Thomas is less important than his views and what they mean to
protecting our constitutional rights," said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.;    When
head of the EEOC during the Reagan administration, Thomas "seemed to go out of
his way to find ways to weaken some of the basic civil rights protections,"
said Simon, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.;    On a number of
occasions Thomas has expressed objections to racial quotas. In a 1985
statement, Thomas said, "Federal enforcement agencies . . . turned the
statutes on their heads by requiring discrimination in the form of hiring and
promotion quotas, so-called goals and timetables.";    In a 1987 article for
the Yale Law

<P>
Policy Review he referred to affirmative action as "social
engineering.";    "I don't want my vote to contribute to an increasingly large
and conservative anti-choice majority on the Supreme Court," said Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif.;    Thomas said he looked forward to the confirmation
process "and to be an example to those who are where I was, and to show them
that, indeed, there is hope.";    Thomas declined to answer questions about
his legal views until his hearings.; WHAT'S NEXT?; Now that President Bush has

  CLARENCE THOMAS' TRIAL BY FIRE
FROM A CRUCIBLE OF POVERTY, A CONSERVATIVE
IS FORMED  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire long ago destroyed the house where Clarence Thomas spent his boyhood. But
nearby, down a woodsy, one-lane, white-sand road outside Savannah, Ga., sits a
reminder of what might have been - the tired cottage where his sister still
lives, by a broad, shining marsh called Moon River.;    Down shore sits the
defunct packing factory where his family and most of the rest of the people in
the semirural cluster of houses and trailer-homes known as Pin Point used to
pick the meat from crabs and chop the heads off shrimp.  
</P>
<P>
There, in the segregated black Georgia of four decades past, began the
toughening of Clarence Thomas, nominee to the United States Supreme Court.;   
Abandoned by his father, driven by his hard-eyed grandfather and a band of
nuns sent south to teach black children, young Clarence learned sharecropping
and scholarship, hard labor and the Latin mass, and how to survive the walk
home through black Savannah in his Catholic school uniform.;    From these
roots, he might have become one of any number of bright, activist black men to
rise out of Southern poverty and press a politically aggressive liberal agenda
of civil rights and affirmative action - as did men like Thurgood Marshall,
the retiring justice whose Supreme Court seat Thomas might take.;    Instead,
Thomas, now 43, became something else - a hybrid product of harsh Southern
history and baby-boom ambition, a proponent of personal strength over
dependence, of individualism over government activism.;    By the time he
arrived in Washington with the Reagan administration, he had developed into a
rare breed - a black conservative so impressive to Republican presidents that
he was set on the road to the highest court in the land. But he was so
disturbing to traditional liberals that they are eager to deprive him of
Senate confirmation in September.;    Historically, trying to predict Supreme
Court nominees has been extremely risky. Still, many liberals are convinced
that Thomas' past clearly shows his future. He would, they say, oppose
abortion rights, school busing plans and affirmative action programs. He would
also weaken the wall separating government and religion and further restrict
the rights of criminal suspects and defendants.;    Not surprisingly, Thomas'
many friends and supporters draw different conclusions. They see him as an
independent spirit, a probable centrist on a court that has been steering
rightward for several years.;    The Georgia beginning;  But any attempt to
understand the potential successor to the revered Thurgood Marshall must begin
in Georgia.;    There, just the other day, Leola Williams, Thomas' mother,
talked about how the force of family worked on her son:;    "Clarence was
surrounded by all our older parents. He saw how our family and other people
struggled to make a living.;    "I guess Clarence wanted to prove to himself
he could be what he wanted to be - and prove to his grandfather he could be
the kind of person (his grandfather) wanted him to be.";    The grandfather,
the late Myers Anderson, began training Thomas in earnest when the boy was 9
and Leola Williams' life suddenly began coming apart. Her house off Pin Point
Avenue had gone up in smoke, and some months later, her husband went north to
Philadelphia, leaving her with two young children and a third on the way.;   
Williams took her daughter, Emma Mae, and moved in with an aunt while she
awaited the birth of her second son, Myers. Clarence went to live with his
grandparents in Savannah, to help with Anderson's year-round oil and ice
delivery business.;    His grandfather proved to be a profound force in
Thomas' life - a mentor, a role model, an unrelenting taskmaster and the
embodiment of a personal philosophy that Thomas once recalled this way:;   
"He used to tell me that there was no problem that elbow grease couldn't
solve. Then he'd say, 'Old Man Can't is dead. I helped bury him.' ";    When
Anderson wasn't coaching Thomas, in his farm fields or on his delivery truck,
he made sure the lessons continued, in the hands of the Franciscan nuns of
all-black St. Benedict the Moor School.;    Thomas, who had experienced racial
mistreatment by white seminarians in Georgia, ultimately rejected seminary
life. He has identified an episode at Immaculate Conception Seminary in
Conception, Mo., in 1968 as the final humiliation. He said he heard a
seminarian there react to the shooting of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by
saying, "Good, I hope the son of a bitch dies.";    Thomas left the seminary
and went north to enroll at Holy Cross College in the gritty New England
factory city of Worcester, Mass.;    A Southerner in New England;  The
Southern farm boy was forced to endure not only the harsh winters of New
England, but also the chilly atmosphere of a white college just beginning to
widen opportunities for blacks.;    Within days of King's assassination, the
school created a scholarship fund named after the civil-rights leader and
stepped up the recruiting of blacks. And so Thomas, who was driven from the
Missouri seminary by racism, became one of the beneficiaries of an effort to
combat it.;    Thomas, who paid for his college education with loans, jobs and
the newly raised scholarship funds, soon was drawn into the turbulence of
Vietnam War and "black power" politics.;    He helped found a Black Student
Union, writing and typing its constitution. In December 1969, he and other
black students resigned to protest the suspensions of black students who had
blocked a General Electric recruiter on campus. Stung, school officials
granted a blanket amnesty and the students returned.;    Thomas went on to run
track and write for the campus newspaper. He graduated from Holy Cross with
honors and left for Yale University Law School in New Haven, Conn.;   
Freewheeling liberalism;  "He came into law school espousing liberal views
from his freewheeling, unattached undergraduate days," said Harry Singleton, a
black classmate, close friend and a former civil rights official in the Reagan
Education Department.;    "But he became more conservative as he went through
the process of legal education.";    Yale law students, Singleton explained,
were exposed to conservative law professors with powerful minds.;    "I used
to discuss conservative ideas with Clarence and he was interested in them,"
Singleton said. "They were about the dangers of big government trying to solve
all the ills of society and how every time you do that you take away from the
liberties of the people.";    But it was Thomas Sowell, the conservative black
economist now at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, whose work came to
grip Thomas' mind.;    Shortly after his arrival at Yale, Thomas remembered
when someone gave him one of Sowell's books and "I threw it in the trash"
because "it really went against all the things we'd been indoctrinated to
believe about the radical movement and the peace movement.";    But after law
school, Thomas rediscovered one of Sowell's books. Sowell's provocative 1983
work, "The Economics and Politics of Race," was "manna from heaven," Thomas
said.;    In that book, Sowell, arguing from a laissez-faire perspective,
endorsed the notion that blacks would benefit more from pursuing economic
achievement than political agitation.;    From Yale to Washington;  Thomas,
always a top student, was recruited out of Yale in 1974 by John Danforth,
R-Mo., then Missouri attorney general, a Yale trustee and a frequent campus
visitor. Danforth brought Thomas to Jefferson City, Mo., to work in the
attorney general's office.;    When Danforth became a U.S. senator in 1977,
Thomas stayed in St. Louis to work as an assistant counsel for the Monsanto
Corp., then in 1979 joined Danforth in Washington as a legislative aide.;   
Reagan administration officials were so impressed by Thomas and his new
conservative leanings that they appointed him assistant secretary for civil
rights in the Department of Education. In 1982, they promoted him to the more
visible post of chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. There
controversy dogged him for the next eight years.;    Congress learned in 1989
that the EEOC under Thomas' direction had permitted more than 13,000 age
discrimination claims to lapse.;    Civil-rights groups accused Thomas of
failing to enforce other anti-discrimination laws as well, and of retaliating
against employees who disagreed with his policies.;    Thomas concentrated on
winning relief for victims of actual discrimination. He steered away from
lawsuits based on statistical evidence and remedies that included timetables
for future hiring.;    But he was unwilling to go along with more strident
voices in the Reagan administration who opposed most legal remedies for
discrimination, so he often felt isolated from both the administration and the
civil rights establishment.;    Several years ago, a top Reagan domestic
adviser who wanted his coffee cup refilled at a black-tie dinner looked up and
spotted a black man in a tuxedo hovering near the table. Holding the cup
aloft, the official asked for more coffee. The black man reached past the cup
to shake hands and said evenly: "Perhaps we haven't met. I'm Clarence
Thomas.";     SUNDAY IN PERSPECTIVE: A reporter who saw Clarence Thomas at his

  THOMAS IN SPOTLIGHT
SENATORS ZERO IN AT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas went before the Senate Judiciary
Committee today, and leading Democrats said they would use his confirmation
hearings to question whether he favors a "radical change" in American law -
including a ban on abortions.;   Thomas sat quietly in a packed committee
room, his family nearby, as Sen. Joseph Biden pledged "open and fair"
hearings. But Biden, D-Del., wasted little time in getting to a topic expected
to consume much of the hearings - Thomas' belief in "natural law," a legal
theory that some individual rights are inherent and independent of all
government authority.  
</P>
<P>
Sen. Strom Thurmond, the panel's senior Republican, said Thomas' rulings as
an appeals court judge were "within the mainstream" and warned his Democratic
colleagues about inappropriate questions.;   "Requiring a nominee to pass an
ideological 'litmus test' would seriously jeopardize the efficacy and
independence of the federal judiciary," Thurmond said.;   But Sen. Herb Kohl,
D-Wis., told Thomas, "We'll want to know what you really think . . . Don't
hide behind the argument that you can't discuss the issues.";   Thus was the
stage set for what is expected to be a lively set of hearings for Thomas, a
black conservative nominated to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall,
the nation's first black justice.;   After each of the committee members gave
an opening statement, the proceedings were stopped for a 90-minute lunch
break. Thomas was to begin his testifying later in the afternoon.;   Even
before Biden rapped the opening gavel, Thomas' nomination triggered a
confirmation battle more akin to a political campaign - television
commercials, endorsements by dozens of groups for and against, and a daily
drumbeat of support from President Bush.;   Abortion aside, Thomas also is
expected to be questioned about his views on civil rights - especially
affirmative action - and the right of privacy.;   Thomas smiled broadly as he
shook hands with Biden and other members of the committee in advance of the
opening gavel.;   Moment of humor; For the most part, he sat quietly at the
witness table while members of the committee outlined their views on his
nomination.;   There was a moment of humor when Biden asked Thomas how old he
was. Thomas, 43, replied, "well, I've aged over the last 10 weeks" since his
nomination.;   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that while Thomas has
never commented publicly on abortion directly, the nominee once praised a
speech that called abortion "the constitutional equivalent of murder.";   But
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a strong Thomas supporter, said Thomas should not be
forced to spell out his views on abortion because Justice David H. Souter, who
won Senate confirmation last year, was not required to do so.;   Questioned on
'natural law';   Biden said Thomas would be asked about his belief in "natural
law." Some critics contend Thomas holds natural-law views that could lead to
the conclusion that fetuses have a "right to life" requiring states to outlaw
all abortions.;   Biden himself is an advocate of natural law in some form,
but he said Thomas apparently holds "a vision of natural law that we have
moved beyond.";   Biden said he would be looking closely to see whether
Thomas' philosophy would lead to imposition of a moral code on the
Constitution and "radical change" in legal opinion.;   Thurmond, of South
Carolina, said Thomas has all it takes to become "an outstanding member of the
Supreme Court.";   "It is not appropriate that philosophy alone should bar a
nominee from the Supreme Court unless that nominee holds a belief that is
contrary to the fundamental, longstanding principles of our nation," Thurmond
said in prepared comments.;   In prepared opening remarks that reflected
Democrats' ambiguity about Thomas, Sen. Patrick V. Leahy, D-Vt., said, "I am
impressed - and the country is - by the less-traveled road you have taken
from Pinpoint, Ga., to the threshold of the Supreme Court. Your
self-discipline, diligence and hard work are exemplary.;   "But at the same
time, your record and your writings trouble me," Leahy said. "I have no clear
idea of your approach to the Constitution.";   "I am also troubled by your
open admiration for those who are willing to deceive and defy Congress and by
the hostility you have demonstrated toward Congress both in action and in
word," Leahy said.;   As the hearings opened, the White House expressed
confidence today that the Senate would confirm Thomas.;   "It's just beginning
up there; it's just beginning," Bush said when asked if Thomas' confirmation
was assured.;   "People know of my total support for him and I think he'll do
very well. But now it's in the hands of the Senate. Let them make this
determination," Bush said.;   'Independence of the court'; Making a fresh
appeal for Thomas on the eve of today's opening hearing, Bush exhorted
lawmakers Monday to "preserve the independence of the court" by avoiding
asking the nominee how he would vote.;   But one member of the committee, Sen.

Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said on NBC-TV today: "I think we have a right to
find out from him exactly what's going through his head on a number of issues.

<P>
And I think to do less than that would be irresponsible on our part.";   White
House spokesman Judy Smith said today that, although the White House would not
divulge numbers in an informal head count, "We're confident Judge Thomas will
be confirmed.";   If confirmed, Thomas would be the 106th Supreme Court
justice but only the second black.;   The committee is expected to closely
examine Thomas' record as chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and as head of the Education Department's civil rights office.

<P>
Liberals contend he pursued policies that slowed, or even blocked, increased
opportunities for minorities and women.;   Feminist groups have been in the
forefront of the liberal coalition opposing Thomas, warning that his vote
added to an already conservative Supreme Court could overturn federal
protection for abortion rights and send the issue back to state legislatures.

  THOMAS TRIUMPHS BY 4 VOTES
FIGHT SETTLED BY CENTURY'S CLOSEST MARGIN  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clarence Thomas, triumphing over eleventh-hour charges of sexual harassment,
won Senate confirmation by only four votes Tuesday night to become the
youngest member of the Supreme Court and its first black conservative.;   The
52-48 vote - the narrowest for any confirmed high court justice in more than
a century - culminated one of the most inflammatory and unusual Supreme Court
confirmation fights in U.S. history.  
</P>
<P>
Thomas is expected to join the high court as its 106th justice next week,
becoming the seventh conservative on a nine-member court already embarked on a
counterrevolution against many liberal rulings of the past.;   Eleven
Democrats joined 41 Republicans to produce the slim majority in favor of the
43-year-old federal appeals judge.;   It was the closest Senate confirmation
of a Supreme Court nominee since Lucius Q.C. Lamar, an appointee of President
Grover Cleveland, also squeezed through by four votes in 1888. Lamar was
confirmed on a 32-28 vote.;   President Bush, elated by the approval of his
nominee, called Thomas to congratulate him. "You did a fine job," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
"You were a wonderful inspiration and you had the overwhelming support of the
American people. You have a lifetime of service to your country ahead. Well
done.";   In a statement issued by the White House, Bush referred to Thomas as
"a man of principle who is sensitive to the problems and opportunities facing
all Americans.";   But feminists were outraged. "Today the Senate sacrificed
the integrity of the Supreme Court, its own reputation and the rights of
American women to the Bush-Reagan agenda," the Women's Legal Defense Fund said
in a statement released after the vote.;   Thomas said he wanted to put his
confirmation ordeal, which lasted more than three months, behind him.;   "This
is more a time for healing, not a time for anger or for animus or animosity,"
he told reporters in a brief interview outside his Virginia home.;   "I guess
in so many ways, as I say to my wife so many times, I'd like to thank
America," he said.;   In Norman, Okla., the woman whose complaints prompted
the extraordinary weekend hearings on sexual harassment allegations against
Thomas said she hoped his confirmation wouldn't stop others from complaining
about harassment in the workplace.;   Law Professor Anita Hill, once an aide
to Thomas, declined to comment specifically about the Senate vote. But, she
said, if she had it to do again, she still would have testified against
Thomas.;   "My gut reaction is that it was the right thing to do . . . and
even looking at how hard it was, I would do it again because it was the right
thing," she said.;   If Thomas is sworn in, as expected, on Monday, he will
have missed oral arguments in 20 cases, including high-visibility disputes
over school desegregation and abortion. He will not participate in these cases
unless the other justices anticipate a tie vote and order new arguments.;  
The Senate vote followed a 7-7 Senate Judiciary Committee deadlock over the
nomination and committee hearings of unprecedented range, from discussions of
lofty constitutional principles to accounts of lurid sexual misconduct.;  
Under oath, Hill accused Thomas of misusing his position as her boss at the
Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by
sexually harassing her a decade ago. Thomas vehemently denied that the events
Hill described ever took place.;   Left unresolved was the central question of
whether Hill was telling the truth last weekend on the sexual harassment
issue. With that issue undecided, Thomas backers argued that he was entitled
to a presumption of innocence and a number of Democrats agreed.;   "Professor
Hill's allegations cannot be used to justify a vote against Judge Thomas,"
Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., concluded in casting his ballot for Thomas.;   The
hearings on the harassment charges led only four previously pro-Thomas
Democrats to change their minds and vote against him: Richard Bryan and Harry
Reid of Nevada, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Bob Graham of Florida.;  
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Thomas was "a decent human being" who was
wronged "because of a process that broke down . . . and his life, though not
ruined by any stretch of the imagination, has been severely harmed.";  
Disagreeing, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said: "To give the benefit of the
doubt to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge Thomas is more important than the
Supreme Court.";   Thomas' defiant and powerful response to the charges was,
to many observers, a critical turning point in the hearings.;   He refused to
tolerate any further inquiries into his private life and portrayed himself as
an innocent victim of "a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks" and "the most
bigoted, racist stereotypes" of the sexual prowess of black men.;   But
several senators deplored the injection of race into the Thomas nomination.;  
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who opposed the nomination, blamed the
administration.;   "I'm saddened that once again race was used as a tool for
short-term political gain," Leahy said.;   Thomas will succeed retired Justice
Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice and the Supreme Court's last link
to the liberal Warren Court of the 1950s and 1960s.;   As the youngest Supreme
Court justice, Thomas is expected to remain on the high court for decades,
long enough to grapple with anticipated 21st-century legal issues stemming
from new reproductive technologies, gay and lesbian claims to family rights,
experimental drugs, multinational business arrangements and other
developments.; How they voted; Here is the 52-48 roll call by which the Senate

What kind of justice would Clarence Thomas, President
Bush's nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by
Thurgood Marshall, be? In a series of interviews with me a
few weeks prior to his nomination, Mr. Thomas echoed themes
that run through his articles and speeches over the past
decade.
- "I don't believe in quotas. America was founded on a
philosophy of individual rights, not group rights. The civil
rights movement was at its greatest when it proclaimed the
highest principles on which this country was founded -
principles such as the Declaration of Independence which were
betrayed in the case of blacks and other minorities."
- "I believe that society is now in a position to
vigorously enforce equal rights for all Americans. . . . But
I believe in compensation for actual victims, not for people
whose only claim to victimization is that they are members of
a historically oppressed group."
- "America should not fall into the trap of blaming all
the problems faced by blacks or other minorities on others.
</P>
<P>
We are not beggars or objects of charity. We don't get
smarter just because we sit next to white people in class,
and we don't progress just because society is ready with
handouts. As a people, we need to find solutions to problems
through independence, perseverance and integrity. As a
society, we should develop better policies to deal with the
underclass than the failed solutions of the past."
While the views of President Bush's first Supreme Court
nominee, David Souter, were virtually unknown before his
confirmation, the 43-year-old Mr. Thomas has boldly
articulated his vision of constitutional law, both as a judge
- he now sits on the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit, the nation's second-highest bench - and,
before that, as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission for eight years.
</P>
<P>
"Basically the job of a judge is to figure out what the
law says, not what he wants it to say," Mr. Thomas told me.
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between the role of a judge and that
of a policy maker. {Judge Robert} Bork was right about that,
no question. Judging requires a certain impartiality."
At the same time, "impartiality is not the same thing as
indifference. This isn't law school speculation. When I hear
a case, I know damn well that something is going to happen as
a result of what I decide. People's lives are affected.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a man's life depends on the outcome. And these are
people looking to me, to the judge, to figure out what's
just, to correctly apply the law. That's not a responsibility
I take lightly. No way."
Many of Mr. Thomas's critics have taken his unconcealed
admiration for Ronald Reagan, his former boss, and Robert
Bork, his predecessor on the D.C. Circuit, as evidence that
Mr. Thomas shares their philosophy of jurisprudence. But in
fact, a careful reading of his articles and speeches reveals
a different sort of judicial conservatism.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the Howard Law Journal in 1987, Mr. Thomas
argued for what he called a "natural law" or "higher law"
mode of judging, in which the judge examines not only the
text of the Constitution or statute but also the moral
principles underlying the American form of government. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Thomas maintains, with support from Abraham Lincoln and
abolitionist Frederick Douglass, that the Constitution must
be read in the context of the principle of equality inherent
in the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
In a powerful speech Mr. Thomas gave on Martin Luther King
Day three years ago, he defended certain forms of civil
disobedience. King often quoted Thomas Aquinas's statement,
"An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal
law and natural law." Part of King's legacy, for Mr. Thomas,
is his reflection on the close connection between law and
morality.
</P>
<P>
President Bush's nominee understands the hostility he is
likely to face in Congress. "When you're up before those
confirmation hearings, it's like going through Dante's
Inferno. . . . I've seen a glimpse of that process. When you
get up there, you just hope that you don't get destroyed so
that even if you don't make it, you can go on with your
life."
Mr. Thomas is likely to be a very different kind of judge
from the man he is replacing. When reminded of Thurgood
Marshall's comment that he could not wholeheartedly celebrate
the bicentennial of the American founding because the
Constitution permitted slavery, Mr. Thomas shook his head. "I
have felt the pain of racism as much as anyone else," Mr.
</P>
<P>
Thomas says passionately. "Yet I am wild about the
Constitution and about the Declaration. Abraham Lincoln once
said that the American founders declared the right of
equality whose enforcement would follow as soon as
circumstances permitted. The more I learn about the ideals of
those men, the more enthusiastic I get. . . . I believe in
the American proposition, the American dream, because I've
seen it in my own life."
Mr. Thomas's life is a remarkable story. Born in a small
frame house on the outskirts of Savannah, Ga., in 1948, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Thomas endured all the hardships of the segregated South. His
father left before he could walk, and his mother worked as a
housemaid and picked crabs from the marsh to eat and sell.
</P>
<P>
The family shared a single outhouse with several neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1955, Clarence Thomas and his brother
went to live with their maternal grandparents, who owned an
ice delivery and fuel oil business. It is here, under the
stern tutelage of his grandfather, Myers Anderson, that Mr.
</P>
<P>
Thomas locates the beginning of his true education. "My
grandfather has been the greatest single influence on my
life," he claims. In 1987 he told the Atlantic, "When the
civil rights people indict me, the man they are indicting is
that man. Let them call him from the grave and indict him."
As Mr. Thomas remembers, his grandfather believed that
"Man ain't got no business on relief as long as he can work.
</P>
<P>
Damn welfare, that relief]" At home the Thomas boys worked
six hours a day in addition to school: raising the chickens,
pigs and cows; cleaning the house and the yard; painting,
roofing, plumbing and fixing; maintaining the oil trucks and
making deliveries.
</P>
<P>
These lessons of hard work, personal dignity and
self-sufficiency were reinforced through years of Catholic
school and college. He finished his undergraduate studies at
Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass. "That's where I
started to get political and radical," Mr. Thomas recalls. "I
read Malcolm X. I became interested in the Black Panthers."
In 1971 he founded the Black Student Union at Holy Cross. He
went on to Yale Law School, where he worked summers at New
Haven Legal Assistance, continuing what he calls "my
political consciousness raising."
Nevertheless, "I never gave up my grandfather's ideals,
and when my left-wing opinions began to clash with those
ideals, I began to move away from the left." Eventually he
took a job with Missouri Attorney General (now Senator) John
Danforth because "he promised to treat me like anyone else.
</P>
<P>
He promised to ignore the hell out of me."
At a conference of black conservatives in San Francisco,
Calif., Mr. Thomas's eloquent departures from the civil
rights orthodoxy on quotas and government handouts greatly
impressed the newly installed Reagan administration, and in
1981 he was nominated to be assistant secretary for civil
rights in the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
The next year he was promoted to the top job of the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
Under the Carter administration, the agency had zealously
promoted numerical goals and timetables. "Thomas came in, and
he rejected all that," remarks William Robinson, dean of the
District of Columbia School of Law.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Thomas had his skirmishes with the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, an umbrella group instrumental in
defeating the Bork nomination, and he made a dangerous enemy
in the American Association of Retired Persons, which accused
him of letting legal protections for the elderly lapse. When
he was nominated to the D.C. Circuit in late 1989, a number
of these special interest groups prepared for a bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
But the storm clouds melted away and Mr. Thomas was approved
by the Senate Judiciary with a 12-1 majority. The full Senate
seated him with only two senators opposed. The reason for the
smooth passage, EEOC vice chairman Ricky Silber man (whose
husband Laurence Silberman sits on the D.C. Circuit with Mr.
</P>
<P>
Thomas and is his closest friend on the bench) thinks, is
that "Clarence has an amazing ability to neutralize
opposition. Just as in his life, he turns negative values
into positive values, an amazing feat."
Can Clarence Thomas be confirmed to the Supreme Court?
</P>
<P>
Even liberal judges will go on record praising Mr. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
"If I or a member of my family were in trouble, he is the
kind of person I'd like to appear before," Judge Damon Keith,
a Carter appointee on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in
Detroit said in an interview. "Our judicial philosophy may
not be the same, but he is a bright and reflective man who
believes passionately in fairness. I say this without
reservation, and in full knowledge of all the people who
complain about him."
Dean Robinson added, "People often confuse what Clarence
thinks with what some of his friends on the right think, but
Clarence is his own man." While at the EEOC, Mr. Thomas gave
speeches accusing the Republican Party of "blatant
indifference" toward black voters, and chastised Ronald
Reagan in particular for letting Bob Jones University get
away with racial discrimination, and for "foot dragging" on
the Voting Rights Act extension.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Thomas and his wife Virginia live in Northern Virginia
with Jamal, Mr. Thomas's son from a previous marriage. Some
weeks before word of the nomination came, Mr. Thomas
confessed to being slightly bemused by all the attention
being paid to him by scholars and courtwatchers. "The problem
for my opponents, and for my friends, is that I don't think I
fit any of these molds very well. Once people figure this
out, maybe they'll leave me alone."

<P>
WASHINGTON - By choosing Clarence Thomas, a conservative
black federal judge, for the Supreme Court, President Bush
may have defused a fierce political battle over the high
court's shift to the right.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas, who has been sitting on the federal appeals
court in Washington for just 14 months, won't be confirmed
without a fight in the Senate focusing on his inexperience on
the bench and his strong opposition to affirmative action.
But barring damaging unforeseen revelations about Judge
Thomas, Democrats will have a hard time mounting a
broad-based campaign against the affable 43-year-old, who is
smart, tough and speaks powerfully about overcoming racism
and poverty in the deep South.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who takes him on in the area of civil rights is
taking on the grandson of a sharecropper," observes
conservative Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas's nomination yesterday got a restrained
reaction from many Senate Democrats. Civil rights groups,
too, said they will have to study his record, both in his
brief tenure on the appeals court and as chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bush's choice is a bold political move, coming in the
midst of the current debate over civil rights legislation and
quotas. The president has nominated a man who would be not
merely the second black to serve on the Supreme Court, but a
man who embodies the ideal of personal achievement rather
than reliance on government programs for a leg up.
</P>
<P>
The choice also will put Democrats on the defensive: Judge
Thomas draws praise even from some liberals. "He has been a
very good colleague," says Chief Judge Abner Mikva of the
appeals court here, a former Democratic congressman.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Democrats specifically urged the president to
consider appointing a minority-group member to fill the
vacancy that was created when Thurgood Marshall announced his
retirement last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas's association with moderate Republican Sen.
</P>
<P>
John Danforth of Missouri, for whom he worked after his
graduation from Yale Law School in 1974, will also weigh in
his favor. Mr. Danforth's support will help reassure many
moderate Senate Democrats and Republicans, much as New
Hampshire GOP Sen. Warren Rudman's sponsorship of David
Souter did after President Bush nominated him last July.
</P>
<P>
While liberals will focus on Judge Thomas's legal
inexperience, his record on the bench doesn't present them
with the sort of target they had with the articulated,
sharply conservative legal views of Robert Bork, whose
Supreme Court nomination was defeated in 1987.
</P>
<P>
A number of Senate Democrats, including Judiciary Chairman
Joseph Biden of Delaware, stressed when Judge Thomas was
confirmed for the appeals court that he would face tougher
scrutiny if he were nominated for the Supreme Court. But that
will be a difficult position to defend in light of Mr.
</P>
<P>
Thomas's success last year in deflecting liberal criticism.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas's strong opposition to affirmative action and
the abortion debate will be grist for his confirmation
hearings. "I don't know where Judge Thomas stands on a
woman's right to choose, but I intend to find out," said
Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, who was the lone
opponent last year in the Senate Judiciary Committee's
12-to-1 approval of his appeals court nomination. "Women have
a right to know whether Judge Thomas is committed to
protecting their fundamental rights."
Abortion-rights groups are also likely to be concerned
about the fact that Judge Thomas is a Catholic who spent a
year in a Missouri seminary in the 1960s pondering the
priesthood. As other Supreme Court nominees have done,
however, Judge Thomas is likely to go to great lengths to
avoid committing himself on abortion, an issue that is
expected to come before the court again and again.
</P>
<P>
The reaction from civil rights groups was muted. Ralph
Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, said, "With so many constitutional rights and
personal liberties at stake, the Senate must make sure
Clarence Thomas has demonstrated a commitment to equal
opportunity and equal justice under the law. . . . We urge
the Senate not to rush to judgment."
To friends and colleagues of Judge Thomas, his own life
story is the most compelling thing about him. With Justice
Marshall's retirement, civil rights advocates worried that
there would no longer be anyone on the court who had
experienced racial segregation. Though Judge Thomas may not
find favor with those groups, the fact is that he knew
nothing but segregation as he grew up outside Savannah, Ga.,
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Born into rural poverty, he lived in a house with no
bathroom until he was seven years old. His father left when
he was young, and his mother sent him to live with his
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
The grandparents raised him with strict discipline,
instilling in him a strong work ethic, and sent him to an
all-black Catholic school run by white nuns. Yesterday,
speaking at a news conference at President Bush's home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, Mr. Thomas choked up when he talked
about his grandparents' influence. For a moment, it appeared
that he might not be able to finish his statement. He praised
them as well as "my mother and the nuns, all of whom were
adamant that I grow up to make something of myself."
As a child, Judge Thomas said, "I could not dare dream
that I would ever see the Supreme Court, not to mention be
nominated to it. Indeed, my most vivid childhood memory of
the Supreme Court was the `Impeach Earl Warren' signs which
lined Highway 17 near Savannah. I didn't quite understand who
this Earl Warren fellow was, but I knew he was in some kind
of trouble."
The first person in his family to attend college, Judge
Thomas spent a year at Immaculate Conception Seminary in
Conception Junction, Mo., before transferring to Holy Cross
College in Worcester, Mass. After law school, he went to work
for Mr. Danforth, who was then Missouri's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
After two years in the Monsanto Co. legal department,
Judge Thomas rejoined Mr. Danforth, by then a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
He then served for a year as chief of the U.S. Education
Department's civil rights office before President Reagan
appointed him chairman of the EEOC in 1982.
</P>
<P>
His eight-year tenure at the EEOC was marked by
controversy. He changed the agency's approach to de-emphasize
settling large numbers of cases quickly, concentrating
instead on instances in which specific victims of
discrimination could be identified. In age discrimination,
particularly, that created case backlogs that distressed
advocates for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Liberals charged that, across-the-board, the EEOC under
Mr. Thomas's leadership didn't aggressively attack civil
rights violations. "As chairman of the EEOC, Clarence Thomas
failed to demonstrate a commitment to civil rights and
liberties," says Nan Aron of the liberal Alliance for
Justice.
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Thomas had strong views and didn't shrink from
expressing them. Rather, he seized every opportunity -
including writing letters to editors, op-ed page articles and
book reviews - to attack affirmative action as patronizing
and as an ineffective remedy for discrimination. In a 1987
letter to The Wall Street Journal, he said, "I firmly insist
that the Constitution be interpreted in a colorblind fashion.
. . . I emphasize black self-help, as opposed to racial
quotas and other race-conscious legal devices that only
further and deepen the original problem."
Since he has been on the federal bench, liberal and
conservative legal analysts agree, the relatively few
opinions he has written don't suggest a strong ideological
slant, although he has tended to rule for the government in
criminal cases and in business regulatory matters.

<P>
One highly controversial case on which Judge Thomas sat
earlier this year has yet to be decided. A three-judge panel
of the appeals court is considering the constitutionality of
a Federal Communications Commission policy giving preference
to women for broadcast licenses. The others on the panel were
Judges Mikva and James Buckley, a conservative. The questions
are: Will Judge Thomas use the case to once again attack
affirmative action, and will that pour fuel on his
confirmation fight?
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas is well-liked by colleagues, both at the
EEOC, where the new headquarters building is named for him,
and at the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
Ricky Silberman, a close friend who is vice chairman of
the EEOC and whose husband, Laurence, sits on the appeals
court, says: "He is a very simple person who loves to say he
was a farm boy and remains a farm boy." A sometime jogger and
weightlifter, he enjoys reading and listening to music
ranging from classical to his favorite, country singer George
Jones.
</P>
<P>
For much of his tenure at the EEOC, Mr. Thomas was a
single parent, raising a son, Jamal. Some friends have
expressed concern that the bitterness of the divorce from his
first wife could spill over into his confirmation hearings.
</P>
<P>
His second wife, Virginia, a deputy assistant secretary at
the Labor Department, is white.
</P>
<P>
In light of the administration's strong attack on racial
quotas in hiring, President Bush's selection of a black man
to fill Justice Marshall's seat brought questions about
whether he was in fact observing a quota on the court. In his
press conference, Mr. Bush strongly denied the very thought
of that, insisting that race wasn't a factor in the selection
of Judge Thomas.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he is black - a minority - has nothing to
do with this," the president said. "He is the best
qualified."
Judge Thomas, who just turned 43 last week, would be the
youngest Supreme Court justice of the past 100 years with the
exception of William O. Douglas, who joined the court when he
was 40. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the Thomas
nomination are expected to be held in September. If they go
smoothly, Justice Thomas could be sworn in before the new
Supreme Court term begins on Oct. 7.

   Apply Marshall's Principles to Clarence Thomas

<P>
With hearings scheduled to begin today, the nomination of
Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court has again
raised questions concerning the responsibilities of senators
and nominees during the confirmation process.
</P>
<P>
Some of Mr. Thomas's opponents have warned that they
intend to make him answer very explicit questions about his
personal and philosophical beliefs, in order to avoid
repeating the example of David Souter, "the stealth
candidate." But if Mr. Thomas does refuse to answer explicit
questions, it will not be merely Mr. Souter's example he will
be following - it will be that of the justice he has been
nominated to replace, Thurgood Marshall.
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) has said that the Senate
is "entitled to a direct, categorical answer" on Judge
Thomas's stance on abortion, and on Roe v. Wade. Thurgood
Marshall's example makes it plain, though, that Mr. Thomas
may refuse to give that categorical answer. During the
Marshall hearings in 1967, the issue of the day was not
abortion but crime, and the most controversial case was
Miranda v. Arizona.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John L. McClellan (D., Ark.) pressed Mr. Marshall to
reveal his opinion of the case. Mr. Marshall refused,
explaining that there were other cases pending on variations
and interpretations of Miranda and that, if confirmed to the
Supreme Court, he would have to rule on those cases: "On
decisions that are certain to be re-examined in the court, it
would be improper for me to comment on them in advance. . . .
</P>
<P>
From all the hearings I have read about, it has been
considered and recognized as improper for a nominee to a
judgeship to comment on a case he will have to pass on."
Sen. McClellan emphasized that he did not want comments on
a future case, but on a past case, Miranda. But Mr. Marshall
held firm, stating that future cases would be related to
interpretations of Miranda, and that the issue of crime was
still very controversial.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Ervin (D., N.C.) attempted to get Mr. Marshall to
discuss the case law that preceded Miranda, in much the same
way that Sen. Joe Biden (D., Del.) attempted to persuade
Judge Souter to comment on the right of privacy at issue in
the abortion cases, by way of Griswold v. Connecticut. But
Mr. Marshall would not even remark on the 14 words in the
Fifth Amendment concerning self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ervin, exasperated, pointed out that since the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is so broad that a case on
practically any issue might come before it, Mr. Marshall's
theory meant that the committee would have a difficult time
asking any questions about Mr. Marshall's judicial
philosophy. "It is a problem," Mr. Marshall said, though a
problem for the committee, not the nominee. In the end, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Marshall would comment only on such long-decided cases as the
Gibbons v. Ogden case of 1824, which concerned issues of such
vintage that they were no longer controversial.
</P>
<P>
Some of Mr. Thomas's detractors have openly worried that
he seems too distant from his origins in the segregated
South. Eleanor Holmes Norton, delegate to Congress from the
District of Columbia, said that she hoped he would "bring to
the bench his personal experience as a poor black man."
Harvard Law School's Derrick Bell fears that Mr. Thomas would
"look black but think white."
But such personal experiences are irrelevant to the work
of a justice of the Supreme Court, according to Thurgood
Marshall. "A judge is not permitted to use his own personal
views under any circumstances," he said, "but if the
particular decision-maker, whether he be judge or justice or
magistrate, applies the Constitution to the facts and it
comes out that way, that is inevitable." Sometimes the
outcome of a case is incidentally related to a justice's
private views, but personal preferences can play no part in
the decision-making process. Such crusading zeal is
inappropriate, despite the 1990 call of Sen. Paul Simon (D.,
Ill.) for a nominee with "fire in the belly." "There is
nothing personal allowed, nothing personal," Mr. Marshall
emphasized. Justices "shall not use their personal views, and
indeed, they take an oath not to do so."
The intellectual leaders of the coalition that defeated
the Bork nomination, notably Laurence Tribe in his 1987 book,
"God Bless This Honorable Court," insisted that the Senate
had the right - and the responsibility - to scrutinize a
nominee's general political or judicial philosophy. This
issue was raised in the Marshall hearings too. Clearly a
senator may vote any way he wishes on a nomination, and for
any reason; but not all votes nor all reasons are consistent
with the duties of senators, and with the manner in which
they ought to behave. This thought was expressed most
eloquently by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), whose primary
contribution to the Marshall hearings was elucidating the
normative guidelines for senators.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Kennedy stressed a central point both in the
committee room and before the full Senate: The Senate is to
assess qualifications; it is not to examine political or
judicial philosophy. "We are not charged with the
responsibility of approving a man to be associate justice of
the Supreme Court only if his views always coincide with our
own," Sen. Kennedy stated. "We are not seeking a nominee for
the Supreme Court who will express the majority view of the
Senate on every given issue, or on a given issue of
fundamental importance." It was Sen. Kennedy's view that only
the professional background of a nominee was relevant for
senatorial consideration, not his substantive views.
</P>
<P>
The question of "ideological balance" on the court was
also raised in this context, and addressed by Sen. Roman
Hruska (D., Neb.). Sen. Hruska had received letters stating
that Mr. Marshall was too liberal for the Supreme Court, that
he would upset the "balance" between liberals and
conservatives. Sen. Hruska dismissed these fears as
irrelevant. "The nominating power lies with the president of
the United States; and if it is his desire to appoint someone
he considers a liberal, that is his prerogative. If he wants
to nominate someone he considers a conservative, that is also
his prerogative." The role of the Senate is to "inquire into
the integrity, the competence and the record of a man," not
his ideology.
</P>
<P>
Several other issues were brought up during the Marshall
hearings that have a bearing on Judge Thomas's case. Sen.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy believed that because Mr. Marshall had been moved
through the Judiciary Committee before, the Senate could
"move expeditiously ahead with his confirmation." Mr. Thomas,
too, has been previously approved by the committee. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Marshall had been accused of having communist ties, in part
because in one case he cited a work by Herbert Aptheker, a
leading U.S. communist theoretician. Committee Chairman James
Eastland (D., Miss.) raised this issue, but only to allow Mr.
</P>
<P>
Marshall to clarify the facts, and to state that he was not a
communist. Mr. Thomas's supposed ties to Louis Farrakhan seem
entitled to equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the fact that Mr. Marshall was black was treated
as noteworthy, but not determinative. In the case of Judge
Thomas, blackness ought to be regarded the same way. The fact
that Mr. Thomas's judicial views are not the same as those of
Thurgood Marshall is a reflection of the increasingly
pluralistic nature of black society, but hardly an issue
worthy of senatorial consideration. As the second black
American to serve on the Supreme Court, Judge Thomas will
shoulder many responsibilities; not because he is black, but
because he will hold a lofty office.

WASHINGTON - This is the moment of truth.
</P>
<P>
In an episode of high drama, Judge Clarence Thomas, who
was only hours away from winning a lifetime seat on the
Supreme Court, and Anita Hill, who says he made her a victim
of sexual harassment, begin to tell their versions of the
story this morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee and
an audience of millions.
The proceedings will be carried live on ABC, NBC, CBS,
CNN, public television and cable outlets. Heightening the
tension were allegations from a second accuser, a former
Thomas aide named Angela Wright, that he engaged in what she
termed "annoying and obnoxious" behavior, including
pressuring her for dates and making inappropriate comments.
</P>
<P>
Given the focused, explosive nature of the hearing, this
is destined to be one of the most dramatic days in Washington
in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
In the narrowest sense, Judge Thomas and Ms. Hill are
staking their own reputations, personal credibility and
careers on this session. But they are also surrogates in a
far larger struggle. The outcome of this hearing will affect
the personal and political reputations of lawmakers, interest
groups, President Bush and the White House political
apparatus - as well as informal and heated conversations
throughout a riveted nation.
</P>
<P>
"Right now the emotions are running higher than I can
remember, with the best-laid plans being upset everywhere,"
says Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the
Brookings Institution. "Washington and Congress are under
siege, and the whole world is watching. Clarence Thomas and
Anita Hill are not the only public figures on trial."
The players in today's drama could pursue a number of
strategies, each with enormous risks:
Clarence Thomas
Judge Thomas has to answer whether he dated, or tried to
date, Ms. Hill. He also must answer whether he continued to
press her despite repeated refusals. The nominee told Senate
supporters as late as Wednesday night that he never even
asked her out. But his affidavit denying her general charges
doesn't answer that conclusively.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas also has to convince the lawmakers - and the
public, watching at home or offices - that he did nothing to
give the appearance that he was harassing her on sexual
matters or was using his position as her boss to create an
atmosphere of discomfort.
</P>
<P>
He and his supporters must decide if he'll be more
credible if he gives an inch or stands firm. He could argue
that he may have said something improper and he's sorry; that
he did approach Ms. Hill socially but did not persist; or
that he simply never did anything that could even be
misunderstood. He'll probably take the last course, arguing
that he made neither social nor sexual advances to Ms. Hill,
and certainly did not press upon her either his sexual
interests or accounts of pornographic materials.
</P>
<P>
He and the witnesses called to support him will portray
him as a man with a formal business style and an almost
prudish approach to work-place relationships. He will face
the hearings with the brand of confidence that left those he
spoke to this week, in the words of William Kristol, Vice
President Quayle's chief of staff, "absolutely convinced he
is telling the truth."
The key to Judge Thomas's success or failure largely rests
with him alone, says Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, the only
Republican woman in the Senate and a probable Thomas
supporter. "Clarence Thomas has to personally address these
issues with a conviction and purposefulness that will resolve
these questions," she says.
</P>
<P>
Anita Hill
The University of Oklahoma law professor began this with
confidential allegations that Judge Thomas had subjected her
to sexual harassment when she served as his personal
assistant at the Education Department. How will she explain
why she continued to work for Judge Thomas after the
purported incidents - and especially why she followed him to
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from their
previous jobs?
</P>
<P>
"If you listen to her carefully, no one can believe that
woman is attempting to smear this man," says Roger Wilkins, a
Thomas opponent and former Johnson administration official
who now teaches at Virginia's George Mason University. "She
is a very credible human being."
She has also been instantly transformed into a symbol by
women's groups and liberal activists who wanted to defeat
Judge Thomas's nomination long before these charges were
aired.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses Judge Thomas has summoned on his behalf will
seek to pick her story apart, citing telephone log comments
indicating that Ms. Hill "just called to say hello" or "needs
your advice on getting research grants" or "wanted to
congratulate on marriage." Ms. Hill will need to convincingly
explain or refute those messages, as well as reports that
have Judge Thomas, for example, helping her land a job on the
law faculty at Oral Roberts University.
</P>
<P>
And Ms. Hill will also be asked why she didn't broach her
sexual-harassment charges in confirmation hearings for
earlier posts that Judge Thomas won.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Hill will have to defend her own credibility
forcefully. But if she appears strident, she may play into
the hands of those who claim she's simply trying to derail
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
President Bush
The president who nominated Judge Thomas has to battle for
his nominee, of course, but how does he do that without
wading into the underlying issue of sexual harassment?
</P>
<P>
Although the president has selected a record number of
women for appointive federal posts, none of his most
important political or policy advisers are women. Only two of
his 14 most senior White House officials are women.
</P>
<P>
Some argue that Mr. Bush would do better to lose the
battle - the nomination of Thomas - than win the battle and
lose a much bigger war. In his zeal to defend his nominee, he
already has opened himself to criticism that he lacks
sufficient sensitivity to the difficulties women face in the
work force.
</P>
<P>
Presidential advisers are counseling Mr. Bush to stay away
from the dispute over whether Judge Thomas is guilty of the
charges of sexual harassment. But Mr. Bush, who is preparing
for his re-election campaign, doesn't want to lose perhaps
the most emotional confirmation battle in decades. He is
walking a thin line.
</P>
<P>
"One fairly obvious consequence is that he is going to
have to, in some way and at some point, acknowledge this
issue," says Ruth Mandel, professor at the Eagleton Institute
of Politics at Rutgers University. "If he doesn't acknowledge
it and address it, it's going to come up in the 1992
campaign."
Sen. Joseph Biden
The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Biden is
being accused of not treating these charges seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
The Delaware Democrat has to perform a tremendous high-wire
act: On the one hand, he has to be sensitive enough to Ms.
</P>
<P>
Hill to show that he cares about the issue of sexual
harassment. On the other hand - as the chairman of a
committee that began the downfall of Reagan Supreme Court
nominee Robert Bork - he must be tough enough on Ms. Hill to
show that he's being fair to the nominee.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Biden knows that members of the committee have had, as
political scientist Robert Starks puts it, "egg on their
faces" for days, answering charges about why they didn't
investigate further when they had at least some information
about Ms. Hill's charges as early as July. The criticism
comes in the wake of continuing dissatisfaction with the
confirmation process from both sides of the ideological
divide, with each side accusing the other of politicizing the
process.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Biden has told associates that he regards this episode
as a "terribly ugly chapter on Capitol Hill," and will seek
in the televised hearings that begin this morning to reclaim
the high ground for Congress. But how can he do that in this
atmosphere of recrimination? He also faces the likelihood of
a Republican-generated investigation of how Ms. Hill's
charges leaked to the public. (The committee, which had
deadlocked 7-7 on the nomination, won't take a new vote; the
Senate vote is scheduled for Tuesday.)
The Democratic questioners
The Democrats will have to look as if they're trying to
get the truth - not as if they're trying to get Judge
Thomas. It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont is a former prosecutor who
seemed to have disbelieved much of what Judge Thomas said in
his hearings. He is already on record as criticizing the
nominee for fleeing from his record, arguing that Judge
Thomas "jettisoned one public statement after another like a
captain trying to keep his ship afloat." Mr. Leahy has
complained that Judge Thomas's advisers counseled him to
"play it safe," and that the tactic "did not fulfill Judge
Thomas's responsibility to the nation."
Sen. Howell Heflin, a former chief justice of the Alabama
Supreme Court, is a conservative Democrat who waffled on the
Thomas nomination and then opposed it, criticizing the
nominee's evasiveness and suggesting he might be a right-wing
ideologue. His role in today's hearing is likely to be that
of the elder jurist; he might be regarded as something of a
barometer for other southern Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The Republican questioners
They want to support Judge Thomas without appearing to be
winking at sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who in the earlier hearings
assumed the role of Thomas defender, will be an energetic
champion. And though questions of sexual propriety weigh
heavily on Mr. Hatch, who has a reputation for being
strait-laced, he can be expected to question Ms. Hill
aggressively and to be an assertive advocate of Judge Thomas.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, like Mr. Leahy a
former prosecutor, has already spoken to Judge Thomas about
Ms. Hill's charges. The nominee denied all the charges to
him; Sen. Specter will want to be sure that Judge Thomas
didn't lie to him. Aggressive and combative, Mr. Specter will
follow the story wherever it leads him, and Republicans know
that he is not necessarily a GOP team player. He voted
against Judge Bork but for David Souter, and supported Judge
Thomas in the committee vote.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the senior
committee member, is an administration hard-liner. He is
likely to deplore sexual harassment but ask why Ms. Hill
waited to come forward.
</P>
<P>
The Thomas handlers
Although the White House is arguing that Judge Thomas is
preparing his defense himself, the team that prepped the
nominee for his hearings is under enormous pressure to redeem
itself and salvage the situation.
</P>
<P>
The handlers, led by corporate lobbyist and former White
House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein, calculated that the
harassment report could be kept confidential, and didn't
press Judiciary Chairman Biden either to dismiss the
allegations or to deal with them. The group's strategy was to
portray Judge Thomas as a person of extraordinary character,
playing down questions of his experience and scholarship, and
they didn't anticipate an attack on what they regarded his
strongest flank.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the group's strategy of having Judge Thomas be
as general and evasive as possible during the hearings -
insisting at one point that he had no opinion on the Supreme
Court's landmark abortion ruling - created a credibility
problem that has haunted the nomination. Concerns about Judge
Thomas's forthrightness cost him some votes he might
otherwise have won - and left him more vulnerable when the
sexual-harassment issue erupted. Now, the handlers are paying
the price.
</P>
<P>
"The horrible problem here is that there is no way to
handle this," says a Republican familiar with the nomination
process.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Thomas groups
For now at least, the activists who opposed Judge Thomas's
confirmation are riding high, having already scored a victory
by delaying the nomination.
</P>
<P>
A number of liberal activist groups, especially the
Alliance for Justice, People for the American Way and the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, have emerged as the
stealth bombers of confirmation hearings, working more
feverishly than even members of the Judiciary Committee
staff. These groups' influence first was felt during the
nomination of William Rehnquist to be chief justice and
intensified during the Bork confirmation fight, as they
developed into a tightly knit network.
</P>
<P>
"The public wants to have the full record placed before it
and the U.S. Senate," says Nan Aron, director of the Alliance
for Justice.
</P>
<P>
The groups and their supporters argue that they provide
invaluable research assistance and are a magnet for
information about nominees. But opponents of the
organizations believe, in the words of Alan Slobodin,
president and general counsel of the Washington Legal
Foundation's legal studies division, that they "will stop at
nothing to defeat a nominee."
If the effort against Judge Thomas fizzles and the
organizations are seen to have grossly overreached, their
credibility will be badly damaged in any future battles.
</P>
<P>
Civil-rights groups that have opposed Judge Thomas are in
an especially awkward position. On the one hand, says Ronald
Walters, chairman of the political science department at
Howard University, their objectives "are going to be served
by this hearing because regardless of the outcome it's going
to damage the credibility of the nominee." But the groups
could also lose by winning: They know that if Judge Thomas
performs poorly today and is defeated, it is unlikely the
president will nominate another black jurist.

WASHINGTON - During a break in last Saturday's defiant
testimony from Clarence Thomas, Sen. Edward Kennedy remarked
on the bitter aftertaste that the experience would leave with
the nominee. "What if he gets on the court now?" the
Massachusetts Democrat asked. "What will he think about
Congress?"
Yesterday evening, the Senate confirmed Judge Thomas by a
narrow 52 to 48 vote - one of the closest in the history of
the court. After a hard-fought victory, however, an
unsettling question remains: How will the excruciating ordeal
of the past two weeks influence Judge Thomas's legal views
and decisions as an associate justice on the Supreme Court?
Even if he hadn't gone through the agony of the past two
weeks, Judge Thomas would have been a crucial addition to the
court, which is closely divided on such extraordinarily
important issues as abortion, religious expression, and free
speech.
</P>
<P>
But Judge Thomas's friends and foes agree that his
nationally televised trial by fire cannot fail to change him
as a jurist. In his own testimony, he said an assassin's
bullet would have been preferable to the public hearings over
allegations of sexual harassment. Moreover, at 43, he is a
relatively young man, and his confirmation hearings suggested
that his views on many central legal questions are in flux.
</P>
<P>
This recent traumatic experience is sure to affect his
thinking.
</P>
<P>
Clint Bolick, vice president of the Institute for Justice
in Washington and a close friend of Judge Thomas, says that
the weekend hearings will deepen his sympathy for victims and
"will reconfirm his very strong belief in individual rights."
But those who had qualms about Judge Thomas before Anita
Hill's accusations against him exploded in public worry that
the hearings will push him in a different direction. "He now
sees himself as the victim of some kind of left-wing
conspiracy," says Estelle Rogers, a Washington attorney. As a
result, she argues, Judge Thomas will be more likely to rule
against the interests of civil rights organizations and
women's groups that opposed him.
</P>
<P>
Others are concerned that the Supreme Court as an
institution will be diminished for having Judge Thomas on the
bench, even though Prof. Hill's allegations of misconduct
were not proven. Conservative legal commentator Bruce Fein,
who had been a Thomas supporter, says the Senate should have
rejected the nominee because "the Supreme Court has got to be
an institution that's above suspicion. That's why Doug
Ginsburg was out. That's why Abe Fortas was out." (Judge
Ginsburg withdrew as a nominee to the court in 1987 after it
was revealed he had smoked marijuana as a law professor;
Justice Fortas resigned in 1969 in a financial scandal.)
Legal experts all along the political spectrum believe the
rocky confirmation hearings will influence the judge's views
on a host of issues soon to be before the court. The charges
by Prof. Hill could hardly fail to influence his thinking on
a sexual harassment case that will be argued this fall. His
lingering anger toward women's groups could also affect his
thoughts on abortion - the most controversial issue before
the court, and an issue on which Judge Thomas has said he has
no current view.
</P>
<P>
His confrontation with Congress, as Sen. Kennedy fears,
could easily enough affect his view of cases involving the
separation of powers between the three branches of
government. The "high-tech lynching," as he called it, could
also make him less sympathetic to a free press in First
Amendment cases.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, liberals hope that his experience at
the hands of the Senate will have sensitized Judge Thomas to
the rights of people charged with wrongdoing. His contention
that he was wrongly accused could make him empathize with
those who protest their innocence.
</P>
<P>
He should be able to survive his ordeal. Judge Thomas is
by no means the first Supreme Court appointee to have
weathered scandal. Others have, and then gone on to
distinguished careers on the high court. Shortly after
Justice Hugo Black's confirmation in 1937, for example, it
came to light that he had been a dues-paying member of the Ku
Klux Klan. Justice Black withstood a storm of criticism and
demands that he resign. He disowned his racist affiliations
and went on to become an influential liberal justice.
</P>
<P>
The Thomas case, however, is unique in some respects. "We
have never had such sustained public scrutiny of such
sensitive private matters" involving a Supreme Court nominee,
observes Robert Katzmann, a political scientist at the
Brookings Institution. The cloud over Judge Thomas isn't
likely to dissipate quickly, especially because the Senate
was ultimately unable to determine whether he or his accuser
was telling the truth. As Judge Thomas helps decide
controversial cases over the years, the specter of Anita
Hill's lurid allegations will almost certainly be evident.
</P>
<P>
Nothing, he angrily told the Judiciary Committee, "can . . .
give me my good name back."
Here's a look at issues on which legal experts think Judge
Thomas's thinking may be affected:
</P>
<P>
SEXUAL HARASSMENT. The bitter battle over Judge Thomas's
treatment of Anita Hill has pushed a relatively obscure case
called Franklin vs. Gwinnett County (Ga.) into the limelight
because it involves sexual harassment. The case, expected to
be argued before the court later this year, centers on a
female high-school student who was forced by a male coach to
have sex with him. The question is, can the student sue the
county school system for damages under federal anti-bias law.
</P>
<P>
The slightest utterance from Judge Thomas during this
argument is bound to be dissected and will be imbued with
special meaning. He might even be asked to recuse himself
from the case, though it's unlikely he would do so. "People
will certainly be looking at how he decides the case," says
Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center, which has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the
case.
</P>
<P>
Some believe that lingering bitterness over Anita Hill's
charges may prejudice him. "What we've seen is that Thomas
would be biased against claims made by those trying to
protect women's rights," says Dawn Johnsen, legal director of
the National Abortion Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
But Ms. Campbell is hopeful that Judge Thomas will be
sympathetic to victims of such discrimination, in part to
rehabilitate his reputation. "We hope this was an educational
experience and that he'll be molded in a way to be more
sensitive," she says.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas may get a boost in this effort from the
politically attuned Chief Justice William Rehnquist. "I
wouldn't be surprised to see the chief justice give him
opinions to write on certain topics, like sex discrimination,
specifically to try to dispel any bad image," says Yale
Kamisar, a constitutional law professor at the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Judge Thomas made plain his abhorrence
of sexual harassment. "I have adamantly condemned sex
harassment," he told the Judiciary panel. "There is no member
of this committee or the Senate who feels stronger about sex
harassment than I do." As chairman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, Mr. Thomas said, he took swift action
against EEOC officials who were found to have engaged in
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
ABORTION. The issue that dominated the first round of
Judge Thomas's hearings last month, was abortion-the most
contentious issue before the court. Democrats questioned
Judge Thomas's credibility when he insisted not only that he
didn't have an opinion on Roe vs. Wade, the abortion-rights
landmark Supreme Court decision, but also that he had never
discussed the 1973 case.
</P>
<P>
Women's rights organizations fear that Judge Thomas's
animosity toward liberal interest groups will influence his
decisions on reproductive rights. Judge Thomas angrily told
the committee that interest groups "came up with this story
{Hill's charges} and used this process to destroy me."
Claudia Withers of the Women's Legal Defense Fund says that
such expressions of hostility by Judge Thomas "give us the
concern that he wouldn't look favorably on claims" by
interest groups that advocate abortion rights before the
Supreme Court and that also opposed his nomination.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments today in
a case involving women's ability to get court orders to break
up the sort of anti-abortion blockades that roiled Wichita,
Kan., in the summer. Judge Thomas wouldn't be able to vote on
the case unless the Supreme Court asks the parties to reargue
it once he is on the bench.
</P>
<P>
But a number of cases presenting an opportunity to
overrule the Roe vs. Wade decision are working their way
through the lower courts, and the justices are expected to
hear at least one of them next term. In the intervening
months, abortion-rights advocates worry that Judge Thomas's
bitterness toward them will harden and push him into an
anti-Roe majority on the court.
</P>
<P>
SEPARATION OF POWERS. One legal expert who knows Judge
Thomas well is convinced that the new justice will be very
negative about any issue enhancing congressional powers. Even
before the experience of the past week, he probably would
have fallen under the influence of Justice Antonin Scalia, a
staunch foe of expanding congressional powers. That alliance
will be fortified now.
</P>
<P>
"Congress," Judge Thomas told the conservative Federalist
Society in 1988, "is out of control." The Senate Judiciary
Committee's performance can only have reinforced this low
opinion of the legislative branch. He called the hearings
"sick" and "Kafkaesque."
Judge Thomas has for a number of years allied himself with
conservative legal thinkers, led by Justice Scalia, who trace
many of the government's ills to congressional overreaching.
</P>
<P>
He called the 1988 Supreme Court decision on the
constitutionality of the independent counsel law "the most
important case" since Brown vs. Board of Education. Judge
Thomas endorsed the lone dissenter in the case, Justice
Scalia, who argued that Congress lacked the authority to set
up a special prosecutor's office to investigate alleged
wrongdoing by powerful federal officials. Judge Thomas
asserted that Justice Rehnquist, who wrote the majority
opinion upholding Congress's action, "failed not only
conservatives but all Americans."
</P>
<P>
PRESS. In his opening salvo against the Judiciary
Committee and other foes, Judge Thomas recounted with disgust
the worst parts of his ordeal, describing "reporters sneaking
into my garage to examine books that I read, reporters and
interest groups swarming over divorce papers, looking for
dirt."
Armstrong Williams, a Thomas friend and former aide,
reports that the judge in part blames the media for his
troubles. "The media took the whole thing and sensationalized
it, promoted false charges, just like the Tawana Brawley
case," Mr. Williams says.
</P>
<P>
There are no cases involving press freedoms on the court's
docket and Judge Thomas has had very limited First Amendment
experience, a gap that gave the American Bar Association
reservations about the nominee. Surely, though, the past 10
days haven't made him any fan of the media.
</P>
<P>
And, in all probability, reporters will continue their
digging into Judge Thomas's past in an effort to get to the
bottom of Anita Hill's charges. "There's a Pulitzer Prize out
there waiting for any reporter who solves this mystery,"
observes Susan Estrich, a law professor at the University of
Southern California, who helped run Gov. Michael Dukakis's
campaign for the presidency in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Once confirmed, a Supreme Court justice "probably can't"
be impeached for past infractions, such as lying to Congress
or committing sexual harassment, says Laurence Tribe of
Harvard Law School. The Constitution says justices may serve
as long as they maintain "good behavior," and that is
generally understood to mean good behavior after they take
the oath, according to Prof. Tribe. That question remains a
murky one, however, because it hasn't been squarely
addressed.
</P>
<P>
RIGHTS OF ACCUSED. In one of the more bizarre colloquies
of the Judiciary Committee spectacle, Democratic Sen. Dennis
DeConcini of Arizona, a member of the ethically tarnished
"Keating Five," commiserated with Judge Thomas about being
pilloried. Although he didn't return the sympathy, Judge
Thomas did say that "on matters such as privacy, matters such
as procedures for charges against individuals in the criminal
context . . . this has heightened my awareness of the
importance of those protections."
Judge Thomas gave earlier hints that on protection of
criminals' rights he might surprise his conservative backers.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the hearings in September, Judge Thomas
spoke of watching from his appeals court office the bus loads
of black prisoners and thinking, "There but for the grace of
God go I."
Being under the glare of the interrogators' spotlight
"could open his eyes, sure," says Michigan Prof. Kamisar.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas will have an opportunity to apply his
criminal-law views in the case of Jacobson vs. U.S., which is
scheduled to be argued next month. Government agents used
three undercover operations over 29 months to send mailings
from phony pornography publishers to Nebraska farmer Keith
Jacobson. He eventually agreed to receive a magazine
depicting sexual acts between teen-age boys, and he was
prosecuted. Mr. Jacobson contends he wouldn't have bought the
magazine were it not for the government trap.
</P>
<P>
In the end, some critics of Judge Thomas worry that his
recent experiences will send him onto the court as an
embittered man bent on revenge against his perceived
tormentors. "This is a dangerous way to send someone to the
Supreme Court, feeling as victimized as he does," says Ms.
</P>
<P>
Rogers, the Washington attorney.
</P>
<P>
But John Danforth, Judge Thomas's most passionate defender
in the Senate, says going through the "agonies of hell" has
made Clarence Thomas "more sensitive to civil rights, to the
necessity of legal protection of the people of this country,
than most people who could conceivably be nominated for the
Supreme Court."

It could hardly have been more ironic to have the outcome
of Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court of the
United States turn on the truth of one incident between a man
and a woman 10 years ago. The real battle was always
incomparably larger. The real battle was joined four years
ago with the nomination of Robert Bork. To Clarence Thomas
goes the victory that Robert Bork was denied. It's not
possible to understand what we've been through the past week
without remembering that earlier struggle.
</P>
<P>
In "The Tempting of America," his account of the issues
that drove the order of battle in his confirmation fight,
Judge Bork wrote: "Because of my writings I had become
perhaps the most visible proponent of adhering to what the
Constitution actually says and of pointing out that where the
Constitution is silent, the people must decide through
legislation. That view is anathema to liberals who have come
to view the courts as the branch that will enact their
policies when legislatures won't. Quite aside from the effect
of my vote on the Court, I was a symbol that they needed to
destroy."
Excepting the differences one would expect among
independent thinkers, Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork are cut
from the same judicial cloth. And so he too was a symbol that
had to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The attack on Clarence Thomas, which boggled tens of
millions of viewing Americans, makes sense only if one
understands that the roots of the struggle extend back to
1980 and Ronald Reagan's election to the presidency. One of
the most persistent arguments of those who opposed the Reagan
era was that it was a fluke, that he was simply not elected
President because people agreed with his conservative
political philosophy. Believing this to be true, opponents of
the Reagan presidency then argued that his nomination of the
like-minded Judge Bork was also illegitimate. As they put it,
"out of the mainstream."
We have argued continuously during these years that this
argument was false, that the voters had indeed entrusted
Ronald Reagan with a mandate (his campaign positions were
clear) and that the losing side was trying to overturn the
results of these elections.
</P>
<P>
With the televised Thomas hearings we have in effect just
held another national election. And the public, by every
measure available, gave Judge Thomas what in a normal
election would be called their landslide support.
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean that the American people support Judge
Thomas - or Robert Bork or Ronald Reagan - in every detail
of their political beliefs. It is likely even that on the
abortion issue, most voters are essentially pro-choice. We
don't doubt, however, that in terms of the presidency or the
Supreme Court, voters are willing to risk disappointment on
discrete issues if they approve the fundamental direction.
</P>
<P>
They have now given their consent in three successive
presidential elections to a direction that can fairly be
called conservative. The Supreme Court nominations of George
Bush comport with those results.
</P>
<P>
The difference, however, between the American people and
the permanent political establishment in Washington is that
Washington no longer feels constrained by the American
political system. It won't wait for the next election, nor -
more importantly - will it make the effort to persuade the
electorate to support its views of Supreme Court nominations.
</P>
<P>
They'd rather fight their battles inside the Beltway,
which lets them operate free of input from this nation's huge
electorate. They can't possibly have wanted the sexual
harassment charge against Clarence Thomas to go before the
entire American population. It did, and they were undone by a
system that they made.
</P>
<P>
That system has depended crucially on the support of an
ideologically compliant Washington press corps, which would
normally render a target politically controversial and, in a
risk-averse town, untouchable. Cut off from their support
base, Judge Bork, Ed Meese, Oliver North and others have been
left bleeding on the Washington fields. With Judge Thomas,
however, the system ran out of control.
</P>
<P>
Washington's reporters, who had already largely broken
away from the editorial controls of traditional journalism,
even broke away from the congressional staffs and
special-interest groups, building the sexual harassment story
into a bonfire of personal and political grievances. They
seemed to be demanding a national referendum on sexual
harassment, meaning a Senate vote for the accuser, and
instead the whole nation showed up and a big majority voted
the other way - to support Clarence Thomas. Perhaps the
voters felt they couldn't trust Washington or Congress with
something important.
</P>
<P>
Now, with Clarence Thomas heading for the Court and the
voters going back to their daily lives, what has been
learned?
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party has to decide whether its future lies
with the world view of the special-interest groups and
anonymous congressional staff, or with people such as Bill
Clinton, Doug Wilder, Paul Tsongas and others, mostly
beyond-the-Beltway governors, trying to conform the party's
historic ideals to the temper of the modern electorate.
</P>
<P>
The congressional and White House Republicans should have
learned that in a period of divided government, they can only
win, as here, by abandoning their traditional passivity in
favor of going on the offensive, and without apology.
</P>
<P>
Black Americans have perhaps the greatest sorting out to
do. The bonfire illuminated the existence of an impressive,
moderate black middleclass. If there is a group of true
political independents in this country, they are it. It looks
as if they have a lot to say to Democrats, Republicans and
white feminists. They should stick around and keep talking.
</P>
<P>
As for Clarence Thomas, we don't agree that he joins the
Court in a damaged state. This country is in the middle of a
historic political turning. There was no reason to expect
that the overturning of the old order would be quiet or easy.
</P>
<P>
But history will note that at the moment Clarence Thomas was
about to be destroyed by the old order, the American people
came forward and by the millions confirmed his appointment to
the Supreme Court. It looks to us as if Clarence Thomas is
the first Justice to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court with a
popular mandate.
