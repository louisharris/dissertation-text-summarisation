Former Regulator: Bush Son On Board Stalled Closure Of Troubled S
&#60;amp;
L
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal officials delayed closing a
troubled Colorado savings and loan largely because President Bush's
son was on its board, a former federal bank regulator charged in a
published report Wednesday.
``Neil Bush's presence was a material part of unconscionable
delays in taking over Silverado,'' James Moroney told the San
Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
Moroney is a former staff analyst for the Topeka Federal Home
Loan Bank, which supervised Silverado Savings and Loan of Denver.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Topeka bank at the time denied that Neil Bush's
presence was an influence.
``The economic substance of Silverado's loan portfolio was
comparable to a Ponzi scheme (a type of pyramid investment fraud),
and it couldn't have worked out,'' said Moroney, 42, a Kansas City
lawyer who left the Topeka bank after six months in 1986.
``It was insolvent back (in 1986). It was not a judgment call.
</P>
<P>
That place, clearly, was very insolvent,'' Moroney said.
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush resigned from Silverado's board just after his father
won the Republican nomination in 1988 and only four months before
the S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
L's seizure.
</P>
<P>
The Chronicle also reported that documents it obtained show top
federal regulators knew the thrift's financial situation was bad
enough to mandate restrictions on investments and insider deals at
least 14 months before it was closed Dec. 9, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Moroney said he believes a big reason his district superiors,
including former Topeka bank president Kermit Mowbray, allowed
Silverado to continue was their knowledge that Neil Bush and
Republican Party fund raiser Larry Mizel, of MDC Holdings, were
involved with the institution.
</P>
<P>
Mowbray, who retired the month that Silverado closed, denied
Moroney's allegations Tuesday, saying: ``Neil Bush being on that
board had no effect on our decisions.'' Mowbray, who said he never
met Bush, also denied knowing that Silverado was insolvent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Moroney said he approached a fellow supervisor and
asked: ``Why are we putting up with this Silverado? We would not
permit that type of loan work-out for another institution.''
``And he looked at me, and said, `Well, you know who one of the
directors is.' And I said, `No.' And he said, `The vice president's
son. Neil Bush,''' Moroney told the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he has no evidence that either Bush or Mizel
exerted direct pressure for ``the preferential treatment they
got.'' He said their presence was enough to cause Mowbray to take
an extraordinary interest in Silverado and to proceed cautiously in
the case.
</P>
<P>
Bush, reached by telephone at his office in Denver, said, ``I'm
going to cooperate in any way I'm asked to. It would be
inappropriate for me to get into any details except with
authorities investigating Silverado.''
In a news conference Wednesday in Washington, D.C., President
Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked whether the president
was concerned that Silverado's collapse might have have been partly
due to regulators who were ``fearful of Neil Bush's role.''
Fitzwater replied, ``These matters are all under investigation
and consideration and we won't offer any comment on any aspect of
it. I might say, Neil's been off that board for a long time.''
President Bush is scheduled to visit Denver on Friday.

President Bush's son Neil was unqualified to
be a director of a Colorado thrift, but that doesn't excuse him
from harm caused to the institution that failed at a cost of $1
billion, federal regulators say.
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush described himself Wednesday as ``just a Denver guy
trying to make a living and raise a family,'' and not as a
freewheeling former director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association.
</P>
<P>
Bush, 34, continued to deny conflict of interest allegations
raised against him by thrift regulators.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bush strongly defended his son on
Wednesday, saying he has confidence in his ``honor and integrity.''
The president, who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in
the savings and loan industry, repeated his promise not to
interfere with regulators' investigation of his son.
``If he's done something wrong, the system will digest that,''
he told a news conference in Houston. ``This is not easy for me as
a father. It's easy for me as a president because the system is
going to work. I am not going to intervene.''
In documents released by the Office of Thrift Supervision,
regulators asserted that Neil Bush was ``unqualified and
untrained'' for his position as an outside director of Denver-based
Silverado.
``Certainly he had no experience in managing a large
corporation, especially a financial institution with almost $2
billion in assets,'' said the documents released this week.
``Unfortunately, he was not cognizant of the conflict-of-interest
situations he encountered as a director of Silverado.''
However, the regulators added, Bush's inexperience does not
excuse him ``from the harm and potential harm he caused'' to the
thrift.
</P>
<P>
The younger Bush has been ordered by the thrift office to answer
allegations of conflict of interest in his role as a director of
Silverado, which lent millions of dollars to his business partner,
who never repaid the money.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Denver, Neil Bush said, ``I am standing
on very solid ground when it comes to defending my role as an
outside director.''
He said that his father ``had wanted me to keep a little lower
profile.''
However, he told reporters for The Denver Post after the news
conference that he is thinking about running for Congress because
he thinks there should be more congressional accountability. ``I
may (run),'' he said. ``Not anytime soon because it's something I
have to build up to. But if I do it, it's probably going to be with
the intent of being part of a shakeup.''
The federal government is considering filing lawsuits to recover
misspent funds from the officers and directors of 1,300 failed
banks and savings institutions, officials told a congressional
hearing Wednesday. Neil Bush could be among the defendants.
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., appearing at Wednesday's hearing, declined to comment on
whether FDIC officials have recommended whether to sue Neil Bush.
``We are treating the Silverado case the way we treat every
other case,'' Seidman told the House Judiciary subcommittee on
criminal justice. ``Every failed institution, we go into and make a
thorough investigation of whether or not there is the possibility
of civil or criminal activity.''
In other savings and loan developments Wednesday:
_The Senate approved a broad crime bill that stiffens prison
terms for savings and loan fraud and offers rewards to
whistleblowers for turning in S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
L looters.
_The former president of one of Texas' largest collapsed thrifts
was indicted on fraud charges in connection with a $700 million
real estate scheme. FBI officials in Dallas announced the
indictment against Edwin T. McBirney III, former president of
Sunbelt Savings Association.
</P>
<P>
The regulators asserted that Bush was unqualified to sit on
Silverado's board. They noted that he graduated from college in
1977, worked on his father's political campaign for a year and
received a master's degree in business administration in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The documents also noted that Bush worked as an oil lease
negotiator for Amoco Production Co. in Denver from 1980 through
late 1982, and later started his own oil company, JNB Exploration.
</P>
<P>
He became a director of Silverado in the summer of 1985 and quit
the job in August 1988, shortly after his father won the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
In earlier years, Bush held summer jobs with Republic National
Bank in Dallas and a small oil equipment company there.

Former Congressman Says He's Advised Neil Bush on S
&#60;amp;
L Controversy
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Rep. Thomas Ashley, a longtime friend
of President Bush, confirmed today that he's been giving advice to
Neil Bush since last winter on the controversy surrounding the
president son's role in the collapse of a Denver savings and loan.
</P>
<P>
But Ashley, a banking lobbyist, denied that Bush had asked him
to contact his son.
``That is absolutely inaccurate,'' Ashley said in an interview.
``I'm to smart to do that.''
The Denver Post reported in today's editions that Ashley, a
college classmate of George Bush's from Yale, had talked to the
younger Bush at the president's behest before Neil Bush was
questioned by federal banking regulators.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper attributed the report to comments by Neil Bush
himself, contained in a deposition taken by the Office of Thrift
Supervision.
``If Neil thinks his father called me, he's mistaken,'' Ashley
said.
</P>
<P>
Ashley, 67, a Democrat, is a former congressman from Ohio. He is
currently president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, a
banking lobbying organization based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush faces a public disciplinary hearing before federal
regulators in September on his role as a director of the bankrupt
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan.
</P>
<P>
Ashley said that he contacted Neil Bush on his own last winter
after reading about his troubles in the paper.
</P>
<P>
Since then, ``I've seen Neil a half dozen times. We talk about
it,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
He said that, although President Bush didn't ask him to contact
Neil Bush, the president is aware that he has been counselling the
son.
</P>
<P>
Bush has pledged not to get personally involved in the
investigation of his son.
</P>
<P>
Ashley said ``I don't think the president has any problem'' with
the fact that he has involved himself in the matter. ``What he
feels is I'm a longtime friend of Neil's.''
``Is everyone who is close to the president supposed to stay
away from Neil?'' Ashley asked.
</P>
<P>
President Bush ``doesn't go along with that. He rejects that,''
Ashley said.
``I've talked to the president (about the situation) on a couple
of social occasions, when we're alone,'' including once at Camp
David, Ashley said. ``I talk about the kids. Neil's one of the
kids.''
Ashley said that Neil has made his own decisions in the matter.
``What we do is talk about the consequences of one course or
another,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
Ashley said that his own experience in politics and in bank
regulation make him a good source for advice for Neil Bush.
``The situation is such that he can't go to his father and talk
to him,'' Ashley said.
``It's not a partisan matter or he wouldn't be coming to a
Democrat,'' Ashley added. ``It's just a situation where somebody
he's known for a long time is available and has experience in
matters involving regulatory matters.''
``I'm a good sounding board,'' Ashley added.
</P>
<P>
Ashley said that Neil Bush decided on his own ``not to take the
easy way out'' and that he's been the victim of ``a little
selective treatment'' from federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
But, Ashley said, ``He hasn't whined or complained about that.''
He said that Neil Bush was concerned that when the Office of
Thrift Supervision ``decided to go public'' about the case, ``it
only presented its side of the matter. A thousand pages. It didn't
include Neil's defense.''
Ashley and Bush have remained close friends since they were both
members of the secret society Skull and Bones while they were
undergraduates at Yale University in the late 1940s.

<P>
Congressional Democrats are one signature
short of the 12 needed to demand the appointment of a special
prosecutor to examine the collapse of a savings and loan led by
Neil Bush.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Rep. Thomas L. Ashley said Friday he has been
regularly advising President Bush's son on his savings and loan
troubles as a longtime family friend _ but not at the president's
request.
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush told federal regulators last December that Ashley, a
banking industry official who was a college classmate of the
president's, ``apparently, you know, called my father, and then so
at Dad's request he called me.''
Ashley confirmed in a telephone interview he has talked to the
president about Neil Bush but said he contacted the son on his own
after reading of his troubles in the newspaper. He said President
Bush was well aware of his activity.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward F. Feighan, D-Ohio, withdrew his name Friday from a
petition to trigger the independent counsel law in the Neil Bush
case, leaving Democrats one short of the 12 signatures needed to
trigger the independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
The law requires the signature of at least 12 Democrats, a
majority of the 21 on the committee, to make the request for a
special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Camp, a spokeswoman for Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who
is organizing the Democratic effort, said, ``I don't think it's a
question of whether we get another signature, but when. It's a live
proposal.''
Feighan wrote in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
``Although I had originally signed a draft of this request, I
notified the authors of the letter earlier today that my name and
signature should be withdrawn from the document that would be
delivered to you.''
He did not indicate why he had changed his mind.

billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ed Rollins, chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee, said the Democrats had sold out ``for a few million
dollars in campaign contributions.'' But the normally mild-mannered
Foley, D-Wash., angrily dismissed Rollins as ``in a panic ... an
out of control person'' making an ``unrestrained and totally raw
partisan accusation.''
Tempers on all sides have risen as more attention has been given
to Neil Bush, who faces a public disciplinary hearing before
federal regulators in September on his role as a director of the
bankrupt Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan.
</P>
<P>
He has been accused of conflict of interest but has said he has
done nothing wrong. His father, the president, has twice defended
his ``honor and integrity'' during news conferences but has
promised to stay out of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush's statement to federal regulators is contained in a
deposition included in documents released by the Office of Thrift
Supervision. It was first reported Friday in The Denver Post.
</P>

Asked by the regulators whether he had ever discussed operations
of the S

``I didn't discuss details with him. And if he inquired about
Silverado, it would have been very rare, I mean if at all, and I
don't know if I ever voluntarily disclosed to him when I was a
member of the board anything about the goings on of Silverado.''
He added, ``I never, I can state this with great clarity, that I
never intentionally brought him into, you know, I mean I never
asked him for assistance or advice on Silverado matters.''
In response to the regulators' questions, Neil Bush said no one
had suggested to him what his testimony on any matter should be.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder one of the petition signers among the Democrats on the
Judiciary Committee, said their request for a special prosecutor
was made because ``the people have a right to feel we're doing
everything to get impartial justice done.''
She said there is a public sense that in the S

the aftermath, ``it's who you know, not what you know or what

Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said, ``The letter is
under consideration as provided for under the independent counsel
statutes.''
Thornburgh has 15 days to decide whether to open a preliminary
inquiry to determine if a special prosecutor should be appointed,
then another 15 days to tell Congress how he acted on its request.
</P>
<P>
He has 90 days from start of the preliminary inquiry to determine
whether to appoint an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
Ashley, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio, said Friday,
``I've talked to the president (about his son's situation) on a

Neil Bush Angry at Being in the Limelight
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To hear Neil Bush tell it, he's ``just a Denver
guy trying to make a living and raise a family,'' and he's
bewildered and angry at the attention he's receiving.
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush, 35, slim, tanned, blond father of three children,
epitomizes the young, enterprising businessmen who came to Colorado
in the early 1980s to get rich in the oil business.
``We lived month to month, begged for money from time to time,
and our business was relatively dormant,'' Bush recalls. But he
relishes that time in his life.
</P>
<P>
Like his father, Bush speaks in deliberate, run-on sentences,
tipping his head during delivery, jabbing his finger occasionally,
laughing an engaging, hiccuppy sort of laugh, displaying
near-perfect teeth.
</P>
<P>
He is comfortable enough in front of a television camera to be a
political commentator, which he was, briefly, two years ago at KMGH
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, Bush hasn't been in the spotlight voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Bush faces a public disciplinary hearing before federal
regulators in September on his role as a director of the bankrupt
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan. Some Democrats are pushing for
a special prosecutor to examine the case.
</P>
<P>
He has been accused of conflict of interest and failure to
disclose ties to men who received loans from Silverado, but has
said he has done nothing wrong. His father has defended his ``honor
and integrity'' but has promised to stay out of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The subject makes Neil Bush angry. While some maintain he played
a major role in pushing through suspicious loans while a director
of Silverado, he is enraged that Democrats are now making political
hay out of his predicament.
``Neil Bush is it for the Democrats. I'm the highest-profile guy
they have to shoot at out there,'' he said in an interview last
week.
``As a director of Silverado I acted prudently, I acted
responsibly. I acted and took my responsibilities seriously, and I
acted with diligence in overseeing the activities of Silverado.''
He also expresses anger at what he calls ``government
mismanagement'' in the way troubled savings institutions are being
sold off.
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush played his most prominent role on the hot, steamy
night of Aug. 17, 1988, at the Republican National Convention in
New Orleans, when he delivered all of Colorado's delegates to help
seal his father's nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
It was a heady moment for the third of George and Barbara Bush's
four sons, and it led to suggestions Neil Bush might have the stuff
from which U.S. House or Senate candidates are made. The
possibility had him shrugging and smiling and saying ``maybe.''
His job then, he told reporters, was to help his father's
campaign. ``I'd hate to be the only son to have lost his home state
for his dad.''
Dyslexic as a child, Bush practiced reading exercises until he
was able to overcome his problem, his brother George recalled. He
eventually earned undergraduate and master's degrees in business
from Tulane University.
</P>
<P>
Until a few months ago, Neil and Sharon Bush and their three
children lived in a tan brick, two-story home in a friendly,
established neighborhood in central Denver.
</P>
<P>
Former neighbors say they would often pile into the family Volvo
for weekend excursions. And they were community oriented, with Neil
serving on the Children's Museum board and Sharon co-chairing the
1989 Children's Hospital Gala.
</P>
<P>
The family moved to a new house, a $550,000 structure on
Denver's wealthier, newer, southeast side. ``It offers privacy,
something that I now thrive on,'' Bush says.
</P>
<P>
His downtown office is light and airy, with Western paintings
and a clear view to the west, where the Rockies can be seen on most
days. His desk carries a name plate, ``Mr. Bush,'' which belonged
to his grandfather, Prescott Bush, when he was a U.S. Senator from
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
It is more lavish than he was accustomed to when he was a
partner in a fledgling exploration company, JNB Exploration Co.
</P>
<P>
JNB paid him a salary _ he won't say how much _ but the business
was later sold, in 1989, and Bush now heads Apex Energy, also an
exploration company.
``My business is oil and gas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush says the oil business has been interesting, and he made
some profit selling lease-hold interests.
``The only problem is,'' he recalls with a smile, ``even though
we kept things going and everything was in pretty good shape in
terms of operations _ we didn't find any oil.
``It's a pretty high-risk business. But we were successful to
the extent we managed to put prospects together and sell them,
which is probably why we attracted the partners we did.''

Bush's `Sensitive' Son a Lightning Rod for S
&#60;amp;
L Scandal
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ``Jail Neil Bush'' posters have sprouted
around town, making their way from the bohemian side streets of
Dupont Circle to the broad avenues of the capital's downtown.
</P>
<P>
The third son of George and Barbara Bush has become, literally,
the poster boy of the nation's savings and loan scandal, his
patrician face plastered on lamp posts in a parody of an FBI
``Wanted'' handbill. His family name, which catapulted him into the
altitudes of wealth and power in Denver five years ago, now has
thrown him into the vortex of public controversy.
</P>
<P>
In August 1985, with scant banking experience behind him, Neil
Bush joined the board of directors of Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association, a Denver thrift that went bust three years
later at a cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
Now Bush stands accused by thrift regulators of conflict of
interest for not disclosing business links to big Silverado
borrowers _ he denies any wrongdoing. He also could be a target of
a negligence lawsuit that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is
considering filing against him and other Silverado directors.
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators are looking into thousands of cases of S
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
L
fraud and mismanagement, and scores of similar lawsuits could be
filed by the FDIC. But Neil Bush's case is different. As a symbol
of the thrift crisis, he could become a political liability for his
father and the Republican Party in a $500-billion campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
Neil Mallon Bush, born on Jan. 22, 1955, was recently described
by the president as ``probably the most sensitive of the four boys,
maybe the second-most sensitive'', ``a good kid.'' His childhood
problems with dyslexia inspired his mother's avid interest in
reading programs.
</P>
<P>
He was 30 years old when he joined the Silverado board _ a
tender age to assume such a position of trust at a federally
insured institution. Only 1 percent of all savings and loan
directors were under 35 in 1988, according to a survey by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
League of Savings Institutions. The average age of a thrift
director was 57.
</P>
<P>
Bush's only work in banking before becoming a Silverado director
was a summer job at Republic National Bank in Dallas. ``I worked in
the trust department filling out forms,'' he told regulators in a
closed hearing last December.
</P>
<P>
The regulators have asserted Bush was ``unqualified and
untrained'' to be a savings and loan director _ although that
doesn't excuse him, they said.
</P>
<P>
Flashback to the heady days of the oil industry in the American
West in the early 1980s. The Iranian oil cutoff in 1979 had spawned
skyrocketing prices and long, aggravating waits in gasoline lines
at home.
</P>
<P>
The rugged oil fields of Colorado and Wyoming, which overnight
had become economic to develop, were gripped by a gold rush fever.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it seemed, everyone was in the oil business. Legions of
brash entrepreneurs swept into town, eager to take risks and get a
piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush was one of them. He came to Denver armed with a
bachelor's degree and an MBA, both from Tulane University in New
Orleans, and some experience working in his father's 1980
presidential campaign and his brother George's unsuccessful bid for
Congress in Texas.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1980, Bush was hired as a landman by Amoco
Production Co. in Denver, negotiating oil leases.
``Neil was very, very tough,'' said Tom Vessels, a Denver oilman
who negotiated lease deals with Bush. He also was ``all-round
curious,'' asking more questions than most landmen, recalled
Vessels, who owns a small oil company bearing his name and is
president of the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain
States.
</P>
<P>
Few others in what's now left of the Rockies oil industry seem
to remember Bush. That's not surprising, since there were scores of
small independent oilmen in the region in those days.
``I've never known anybody who's dealt with him in the oil
business,'' said Bill Owens, executive director of the Colorado
Petroleum Association.
</P>
<P>
Bush left Amoco in late 1982 and set up an oil partnership with
two geologists called JNB Exploration Co. For an investment of only
$100, Bush acquired 23.4 percent of the business.
</P>
<P>
For two years, JNB drilled a succession of dry holes in
Wyoming's Powder River Basin and failed to become profitable.
</P>
<P>
That was common in those days. What was unusual, oilmen say, was
how Bush's ``silent'' partners kept pumping money into the business
despite its track record.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Bush was a son of the vice president likely had
something to do with that. His silent partners in JNB _ wealthy
Denver developers Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters _ probably
reckoned they might get more than oil from the millions of dollars
they invested in Bush's company.
</P>
<P>
Influence and connections can often be as valuable as money to
people like Good and Walters, who were already heavy borrowers from
high-flying Silverado when Bush joined the board.
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Wise, the chairman of Silverado at the time, also
knew the value of connections. He was on the board of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
League, the S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
L industry's main lobbying group, and had personal
contacts with regulators.
</P>
<P>
In mid-1985, Wise invited Bush to join the board of Silverado,
which was at the zenith of its go-go period.
</P>
<P>
Silverado was making huge loans for grandiose real estate
schemes right and left, though many of the ventures were never
finished. The thrift was a gold mine for fast-and-loose developers,
since it was playing with depositors' money that was insured by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
Good and Walters, two of the biggest borrowers, got a combined
$117 million in loans that they never repaid. The leading borrower,
Bell Savings and Loan Association of San Mateo, Calif., got $124.8
million. Its chairman at the time, David Butler, pleaded guilty
last year to loan fraud and was sentenced to two years in prison.
``Management of Silverado took excessive risks, engaged in
abusive or questionable practices to generate short-term gains and
undertook innovative manipulations to avoid recording losses,'' the
Office of Thrift Supervision said in a report published last May.
``The board did little beyond rubber stamping the activities of
(Silverado's) sophisticated, bright and manipulative management
team.''
As a director, Bush voted to approve loans _ including some of
the projects sponsored by Good and Walters. The regulators have
accused him of conflict of interest in not disclosing to Silverado
his links with the two developers through JNB.
</P>
<P>
Bush denies the allegations. He concedes, however, that his
family ties helped him get the Silverado position.
``I would be naive if I were to sit here and deny that the Bush
name didn't have something to do with it,'' he said in a recent
interview with Time magazine. ``Maybe the advantage of being part
of the vice president's family at the time was that I was accepted
more quickly in terms of age and years in this community (Denver)
than others of my peer group.''
The family name, however, has become a double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
Because he is the president's son, Bush has captured the public
imagination more than any other player in the national S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
L drama.
</P>
<P>
The unsigned ``Jail Neil Bush'' posters haven't reached Main
Street, but across the country, Neil Bush's face is now recognized
by many of the taxpayers who will have to shell out $2,000 each to
cover thrift losses.

Assn. and sought to bar him from future service as a thrift director, according 
to a confidential memorandum disclosed Tuesday at a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, prepared early this year by the enforcement staff of the federal 
Office of Thrift Supervision, was never formally issued as a complaint against 
Bush, and the agency eventually moved against him on lesser charges. 
</P>

insolvencies. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush was not present at Tuesday's hearing, but in previous appearances he 
has strongly denied any wrongdoing in connection with his tenure as a Silverado 
director. He is challenging in an administrative proceeding the government's 
allegations that he violated thrift rules. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L, Kenneth M. Good, was going to pay $3 
million for an 80% interest in Bush's oil exploration company, the OTS document 
says. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L because he allegedly could not pay his bills, the memorandum states. 
</P>
<P>
Bush abstained from voting on Silverado's loans to Good, but the OTS document 
said he did not disclose his business relations with Good as required by 
federal regulations affecting thrift directors. 
</P>
<P>
Good and another investor in Bush's firm, William L. Walters, ultimately 
defaulted on more than $130 million in loans at Denver-based Silverado. The 
cleanup of the institution, which was seized by federal regulators last 
December, could cost taxpayers as much as $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Good, appearing in response to a subpoena by the House Banking, Finance and 
Urban Affairs Committee, defended the President's son. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time did I ask or expect Neil to influence or vote on any of the 
transactions that were negotiated with Silverado management," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Good said he was "shocked by the personal attacks that continue to be made upon 
(Bush) with regard to his role in Silverado. I can testify without hesitation 
that Neil is a man of absolute integrity . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), who obtained the OTS document, said the office 
and its predecessor, "under Republican control for nearly the past 10 years, is 
clearly not an agency designed to make political hay by going after the son of 
the President of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"Serious charges have been leveled against Neil Bush," Annunzio said. "Is that 
the end of the case? That the taxpayers are going to have to pick up a 
$1-billion tab without ever knowing whether Neil Bush was right or wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
amp;L, where Neil Bush served as a 
director from August, 1985, until August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have tried to link the President's son to greedy real estate 
developers who defaulted on loans from the thrift, and Republicans have 
defended him as an honest, if occasionally naive, young man. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush left the Silverado board in August, "the Colorado savings and loan 
commissioner had all but sounded the death warning when he told Silverado that 
it would have to raise $62 million of new capital or face a closure order," 
committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said. 
</P>
<P>
When the state official moved to enforce his order and attempted to shut 
Silverado in October, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in 
Washington quickly ordered a two-month delay, putting off any action until 
after the presidential election. Kermit Mowbray, serving as the chief regulator 
for the region, told the committee that he received a phone call from his 
superiors in Washington directing a postponement in closing Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 9, the day after President Bush won the election, Mowbray submitted a 
formal recommendation that Silverado be placed into receivership, and the 
government took control on Dec. 9. In response to questions, Mowbray said he 
did not think the postponement was based on political considerations. He said 
he had never been subjected to any political pressure or influence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In the memo, the federal regulators' criticism of Neil Bush focused on his 
failure to disclose his business ties with Walters and Good, major borrowers at 
Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
Walters invested $150,000 in JNB, Bush's oil exploration firm, providing half 
of its original capital. Bush later voted to approve loans to Walters and his 
companies, although he abstained from voting on loans to Good. 
</P>
<P>
The enforcement staff's document, prepared in January, named Bush, along with 
former Silverado Chairman Michael Wise, Director James Metz, Executive Vice 
President Russell Murray, and outside counsel Ronald Jacobs. It said their 
conduct "involved personal dishonesty, or demonstrated a willful or continuing 
disregard for the safety or soundness of Silverado." 
</P>
<P>
The document called for a hearing to decide on issuance of an order barring the 
four men from ever working again for federally insured institutions without 
prior government approval. The proposed prohibition was never issued by the 
Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez noted that Wise and Metz, and two other former Silverado executives, 
chief operating officer Richard K. Vandapool and chief financial officer Robert 
M. Lewis, signed consent orders accepting the prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS filed a lesser complaint against Neil Bush, seeking a cease-and-desist 
order that would direct him to refrain from committing any future violations of 
disclosure rules. An administrative law judge at the agency will conduct a 
hearing later this year to determine whether to proceed against Bush. 
</P>
<P>
There was not sufficient evidence against Bush to seek a prohibition order, 
according to OTS officials. 
</P>
<P>
The pending case against Bush "has thrown a bright spotlight on the obligation 
of boards of directors to meet their fiduciary responsibility," Gonzalez said. 
"This responsibility is critical to the safety and soundness of any 
institution, and it is the first line of defense against raids on the insurance 
funds and the taxpayers."

NEIL BUSH FUDGED ON ETHICS - REGULATOR 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The failed savings and loan association where Neil Bush was a director had a 
strict code of ethics requiring officials to avoid any action that might "in 
any way" be a conflict of interest, and the President's son ignored the rules, 
a federal regulator testified Wednesday.

connections with Bill L. Walters and Kenneth M. Good, two big borrowers at 
Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
Even if there is nothing more than an appearance of conflict of interest, "the 
director should seek to avoid that situation," said Sandefur, the assistant 
deputy district director for the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS is seeking a cease-and-desist order barring Bush from any future 
violation of conflict of interest regulations. 
</P>
<P>
amp;Ls will cost taxpayers $130 billion, 
the role of the President's son in the Silverado case is drawing nationwide 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
His defenders portray Neil Bush, who was 30 when he joined the Silverado board 
in 1985, as an honest but naive young man who is being persecuted because he is 
the President's son. But federal regulators say Neil Bush was supporting 
Silverado financing for Good and Walters without disclosing that they were 
bankrolling his oil exploration business. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the OTS complaint, Bush is one of the defendants in a 
$200-million suit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. against the Silverado 
directors. Walters and Good defaulted on more than $130 million in loans at 
Silverado during the three-year period when Bush served on the board. 
</P>
<P>
amp;L's interest. 
</P>
<P>
Directors also should submit annual statements covering potential conflicts of 
interest, and should offer special submissions "if the director feels any of 
his activities, interests or relationships might possibly give rise to a 
conflict of interest," according to the Silverado ethics guide, dated April 24, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The officer or director's statements should "include any activity that might in 
any way be deemed to constitute" a conflict of interest, the document said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will conclude today with the long-awaited appearance of Neil Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Davidson, the administrative law judge handling the case, will decide 
next year whether to recommend issuing the cease-and-desist order against Bush. 
The final decision will be made by Timothy Ryan, the OTS director. His ruling 
can be appealed to the courts.

NEIL BUSH BROKE CONFLICT RULES, OFFICIAL DECIDES; 
THRIFTS: AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE SAYS THE PRESIDENT'S SON FAILED TO 
DISCLOSE HIS BUSINESS TIES TO TWO BIG BORROWERS OF A FAILED DENVER THRIFT. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An administrative law judge ruled Tuesday that President Bush's son, Neil, 
violated conflict-of-interest regulations in the failure of a Denver thrift and 
recommended that he be restricted in any future roles with financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Loan Assn., where he was a director for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Bush "engaged in unsafe and unsound practices involving multiple conflicts of 
interests," said the judge, who works for the Office of Thrift Supervision, 
which regulates thrifts and brought the civil charges against Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Bush contested the allegations at a hearing in Denver last September, and his 
attorney said Tuesday that the judge's decision would be appealed to the 
director of OTS. If the ruling is upheld, the attorney said he will take the 
matter to federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it sounds any more logical or rational than when OTS argued it," 
said James E. Nesland, Bush's attorney. "When we go to a real court with real 
judges, I expect to have a contradictory decision and have it decided on the 
merits." 
</P>
<P>
OTS could have sought a ban that would have barred Bush from being involved 
with a bank or savings institution ever again. But the agency had requested 
only a so-called cease-and-desist order to restrict Bush's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel J. Davidson, the administrative law judge, recommended that Bush be 
required to obtain a lawyer's advice on potential conflicts if he takes another 
position at a financial institution. The judge also said Bush should make a 
full disclosure of his business deals annually and abstain from voting on 
issues where he has an interest if he joins another institution. 
</P>
<P>
The White House press office said President Bush would have no comment on the 
judge's findings. When the allegations first surfaced, the President said he 
had full faith in his son, but he vowed to stay out of the legal process. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush, a Denver oilman, was a director of Silverado from 1985 to 1988. He 
resigned when his father was nominated to the Republican presidential ticket. 
Later that year, regulators seized Silverado and declared it insolvent. Its 
failure is expected to cost the taxpayers $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the allegations against Bush were his relationships with two 
Colorado developers, Bill L. Walters and Kenneth M. Good. The two developers 
ultimately defaulted on more than $100 million in loans from Silverado, which 
helped bring about its collapse, according to regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators charged that Neil Bush failed to disclose adequately to his 
fellow directors that he had extensive business dealings with the developers at 
a time that they were receiving loans from Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
According to the charges, Neil Bush violated his duties by voting to approve 
loans to Walters without disclosing the extent of his business deals with 
Walters and he personally arranged for Walters to receive a $900,000 line of 
credit from Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators also accused Bush of failing to tell his fellow directors that 
Good was preparing to invest $3 million in Bush's oil drilling firm at a time 
Good told Silverado he was broke and could not make his loan payments. Good 
also loaned Bush $100,000 that was never repaid. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Davidson accepted the agency's allegations concerning the 
conflict-of-interest violations and said they constituted unsafe practices. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, said 
in an interview that the administrative judge's decision seemed appropriate to 
the actions of Bush, who testified at hearings conducted earlier this year by 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, my own opinion is that he was a little minnow swimming with a bunch 
of barracudas," said Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his fellow directors and some former Silverado executives also face a 
$200-million lawsuit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which accuses them 
of gross negligence.

   Neil Bush, Despite Applying `Smith Smell Test,'
   Gets Compared With Billy Carter, Donald Nixon

DENVER - Neil Bush calls it the Smith Smell Test.
</P>
<P>
"People call up and say, `Hey Neil, I've got this great
deal,'" says the president's embattled but still amiable son.
</P>
<P>
"The smell test is: If my name were Neil Smith, would they be
asking me to engage in this venture with them?"
Mr. Bush says he's never violated his smell test by
trading on being George Bush's son. But with the spotlight on
his role in the collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Loan
Association, which is expected to cost taxpayers $1 billion,
comparisons inevitably are made with Billy Carter, Donald
Nixon and other presidential relatives whose finances brought
embarrassment to the White House. As a former Silverado
director, Mr. Bush has come under fire for overseeing loans
that involved two investors in his oil company.
</P>
<P>
But what has caught public attention is a $100,000 loan
that Mr. Bush received before joining the Silverado board
from Kenneth Good, a Denver real-estate developer and
investor in JNB Exploration, Mr. Bush's oil company. Mr. Good
arranged to invest the money in the commodities market on Mr.
</P>
<P>
Bush's behalf, with the understanding that any profits would
be Mr. Bush's, while any losses would be absorbed by Mr.
</P>
<P>
Good.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bush, who not only looks but also acts like the Jimmy
Stewart of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," made headlines by
conceding in congressional testimony that the Good loan
sounded "a little fishy."
Mr. Bush's friends say he lacks a sophisticated
understanding of the darker forces in life. "I think there's
a refreshing naivete about Neil," says Mr. Bush's adviser,
former Democratic Rep. Thomas Ashley, who's known George Bush
since his Skull and Bones days at Yale. "He's not jaded."
Since Neil Bush's youth, when he was afflicted with
dyslexia - his brother Marvin recalls that "homework would
take him a little bit longer" than the other Bush children -
he has been known for his good-natured willingness to pitch
into any task. While his siblings would scatter when their
parents ordered that yard work be done, recalls Marvin Bush,
"Neil would step up and say, `Yeah, great.'"
Friends and business associates agree that Neil Bush's
family name lent him a certain aura within the Denver
business community when he settled there after working on his
father's 1980 presidential bid. Mr. Bush put in two years at
Amoco Corp. to learn the oil business, then left that
$30,000-a-year job to start an oil-exploration company of his
own. Investors were drawn to Mr. Bush "partly, I suppose,
because he was the son of the vice president," concedes Evans
Nash, Neil Bush's former partner. "I'm sure that helped him
meet people."
Even Mr. Bush's lawyer concedes that being George Bush's
son raised Neil's profile in Denver. "We don't have a lot of
celebrities," explains attorney James Nesland. "We had Marvin
Davis for a while. Now he's gone," he says, registering that
oil man's departure for Hollywood with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
Settled in Denver, Neil Bush became a fixture on the local
political scene, giving speeches at Lincoln Day dinners and
stumping for his father and a variety of local Republican
candidates. "He's an enthusiastic speaker," notes Bruce
Benson, chairman of the Colorado Republican Party. "He speaks
of good Republican values."
Neil Bush can be startlingly blunt in enunciating
conservative themes. According to one local news account, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Bush told a group of Hispanic voters in 1988 that welfare was
"worse than slavery."
Mr. Bush also settled into Denver's social elite. With his
wife, Sharon, and three children, he lived in suburban
seclusion amid rolling greens and humming golf carts inside a
walled country-club development. The handsome young couple
became a fixture at dinner parties and charity events.
</P>
<P>
It was at one such party in 1985 that Neil Bush met
Michael Wise, chairman of Silverado. Mr. Wise was seeking a
new director for Silverado's board - preferably someone
young, because the board was top-heavy with older members,
and preferably someone with experience in the oil business,
which was underrepresented. Mr. Bush accepted. "I considered
it a chance to learn," he later told the Denver Post.
</P>
<P>
With no experience in banking, Mr. Bush, then 30 years
old, nevertheless seemed a logical choice to those close to
Mr. Wise. "Mike Wise seemed to like to be a first-class
dresser," observes Alexander Walter, a former loan-portfolio
manager at Silverado. "His automobile was always impeccably
clean." Neil Bush, Mr. Walter implies, was another such
ornament.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Wise declined to return calls, and through an
intermediary referred all inquiries to his lawyer, Bettina
Lawton. Ms. Lawton says Mr. Bush's last name was "certainly
not a primary consideration" when Mr. Wise chose him for the
board.
</P>
<P>
Despite Mr. Bush's youth and inexperience in banking
matters, former Silverado officials say Mr. Bush was no less
able a board member than the others. According to Mr. Walter,
most had "no hands-on experience" with the complex
Silverado's business. Former Silverado board member Diane
Ingels says Mr. Bush was a "very diligent" director who "met
with other directors and with management to enhance his
understanding."
Still, Mr. Bush remains defensive about his qualifications
to sit on Silverado's board. Sitting in his office
overlooking downtown Denver, a small bust of his father
behind him, he lurches unprompted from discussing his work on
a political campaign into a defense of his work on
Silverado's board. "I was just as well prepared to be on that
board as anyone," he protests.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bush is also emphatic in denying that Mr. Good's
risk-free loan violated the Smith Smell Test. "It's just his
way of having fun," Mr. Bush says. "I wasn't going to deny
him his chance of having fun."
Mr. Bush says Mr. Good set up similar accounts for Mr.
</P>
<P>
Good's secretary and bookkeeper. Mr. Good couldn't be reached
for comment, but in testimony last month before the House
Banking Committee, he described the loans as "a means of
attracting and keeping loyal business associates." Still,
neither of Mr. Bush's two partners at JNB Exploration
received such loans. Mr. Bush says they weren't as close to
Mr. Good. The money was eventually lost when the commodities
investments went sour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mr. Bush is wrestling against
conflict-of-interest charges by the federal Office of Thrift
Supervision concerning his service on the Silverado board.
</P>
<P>
The thrift office has charged that as a Silverado director
Mr. Bush voted on loans to William Walters, a Denver real
estate agent who was one of two original investors in JNB
Exploration. Mr. Bush answers that there wasn't any legal
requirement that he abstain from the votes.
</P>
<P>
The thrift office also contends that Mr. Bush failed to
properly disclose his interest when he helped Mr. Good
receive a $900,000 line of credit from Silverado in order to
assist an Argentine project involving JNB Exploration. But
Mr. Bush produced a memo that appears to demonstrate that his
interest was disclosed to the board before it approved the
line of credit. These and other charges will be publicly
aired at administrative hearings to be held this September in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
Amid everything, Mr. Bush maintains a self-deprecating
wit. He has "no airs or graces about him," observes
Republican political consultant Peter Teeley, who recently
phoned Mr. Bush to offer advice and support. Mr. Nesland, the
lawyer, says that after he scolded Mr. Bush for his "fishy"
gaffe, Mr. Bush clipped a newspaper photograph of himself at
the hearing, with Mr. Nesland and Sharon Bush sitting behind
him. "I can't believe he said that," Mr. Bush scribbled in a
bubble drawn above Mr. Nesland's head, according to Mr.
</P>
<P>
Nesland. "Oh no, not again," Mr. Bush wrote in another bubble
above his wife.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mr. Bush's spirits are sufficiently buoyant that,
in the midst of seeing himself portrayed as a major S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
L
villain, he can still envision pursuing a career in politics.
</P>
<P>
Ten years from now, he muses, "I may be a U.S. senator. Who
knows?"
