  TAPE OF POLICE BEATING PROVOKES FUROR IN
L.A.  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bystander's videotape that captures Los Angeles police officers repeatedly
striking a prone, apparently defenseless man stirred a public furor Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley declared himself "shocked and outraged" by the incident,
which was broadcast on national television.;    The FBI and the Los Angeles
County district attorney both announced that they had opened investigations
into the Sunday morning incident. The Los Angeles Police Department is also
investigating.  
</P>
<P>
The homemade videotape, shot early Sunday morning in the Los Angeles
community of Lake View Terrace, appears to depict at least a dozen police
officers surrounding a man after he left his car, kicking him and inflicting
more than 30 blows with nightsticks as he lay on the pavement. The tape, shot
from a nearby balcony, recorded no sound.;    It was first shown Monday night
by a Los Angeles television station and broadcast throughout the day Tuesday
by Cable News Network. The violent images produced an immediate public
outcry.;    At a Los Angeles Police Commission meeting Tuesday afternoon,
Chief Daryl Gates called the tape shocking but said he would withhold judgment
until the incident had been investigated.;    Bradley was unequivocal in his
response: "This is something we cannot and will not tolerate," the Los Angeles
mayor said. "It's now a matter of our identifying and finding witnesses. . . .
</P>
<P>
I assure you that, once that's done, appropriate action will be taken by the
department and the police commission.";    Police officials identified the man
as Rodney Glenn King, an ex-convict who lives in Altadena.;    California
Highway Patrol officials said King's 1988 white Hyundai was clocked on the
freeway at up to 115 mph early Sunday morning. Los Angeles police officers
joined the pursuit when King exited to surface streets, running several red
lights, a Highway Patrol spokesman, Sgt. Mike Brey, said.;    Los Angeles
Traffic Detective Richard Talkington told the Los Angeles Times that written
police reports from officers involved said King ignored several requests to
leave the car after he was stopped.;    King finally lay down on the ground,
prone, at the officers' orders, he said. One officer approached King to
handcuff him, and when King attempted to stand up, Officer Laurence Powell put
his knee on his back to keep him down, Talkington said.;    Talkington said
King continued to rise, causing Powell to fall, "and that's when the fight
started." But the videotape contains no indication that King attempted to hit
the officers.;    Three witnesses who live near the site of the incident said
Tuesday that King did not fight officers.

<P>
The world reacted with sickened shock and outrage to the brutal beating of a
Southern California man by police officers, played out in painful clarity on
the screens of tens of millions of television sets this week from an amateur
photographer's videotape.;    Some in the black community here reacted with
more of a shrug.  
</P>
<P>
"You talk to people in the black community here, and they say, 'This is not
news,' " said Joe Hicks, an American Civil Liberties Union spokesman who grew
up in the community. "They say, 'Why are all the white people so surprised? A
guy got his butt beat by the cops. It happens all the time.' ";    Behind the
shrug, though, emotions run deep. "There's nothing you can imagine the guy had
done that would justify that kind of response," Hicks said.;    Rodney Glen
King, the victim of the beating, on Wednesday was released from Los Angeles
County Jail after prosecutors said police had failed to prove their charges
that he resisted arrest after a high-speed chase. The 10 officers involved in
the beating have been taken off patrol.;    King told reporters that there had
been no chase, that he had done nothing to provoke the attack and that he was
"scared for my life" during the beating.;    "I'm lucky they didn't kill me,"
King said from a wheelchair, displaying a broken ankle, damaged eye and
bruises.;    He said that police "continued to pound on me and beat on me all
over my body . . . all over my body. My ankles. They beat where it hurt. They
beat my whole body where it hurt.";    Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates,
long controversial for racial statements he has made, called the brutality
depicted on the tape "an aberration.";    The department issued no statements
Wednesday. Agencies including the FBI, the LAPD, Los Angeles District
Attorney's Office and the California Highway Patrol are investigating the
beating.;    Police wanted prosecutors to charge King with battery on an
officer and resisting arrest, said King's lawyer, Robert Rentzer. But the
district attorney's office refused.;    "We have sent the case back to police
for further investigation," said Deputy District Attorney Don Eastman. "There
are a lot of things we want to look at and a lot of witnesses who were not
interviewed.";    The district attorney's office said officers failed to
interview available witnesses, including two of King's passengers.;    The
pursuit of King's white 1988 Hyundai was initiated by CHP officers, who
estimated that King's car was hitting speeds as high as 115 mph on a freeway.
</P>
<P>
The CHP officers said that they called for assistance and had pulled King over
in the Terrace San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles when several Los
Angeles police officers "jumped into the mess," said a law enforcement source
familiar with the report CHP officers filed with their supervisors. When the
sedan finally stopped off the freeway, King was ordered out of the car.;   
The source said that a police sergeant told the CHP that his officers would
handle things. Witnesses said that King was already lying on the ground when a
police officer shot him with a stun gun, delivering an electrical shock.
</P>
<P>
Officers then clubbed him wildly. There was a brief lull and King lay silent
until one officer stomped on his head.;    One of the CHP officers at the
scene exhorted the police officers to stop the beating, but was told, in
effect, to "stay out of it," according to the source.;    King, lifting his
hospital garb to show other marks, a large bruise on his chest, said police
"shocked me . . . they paused for a minute and then they struck me across the
face real hard with a billy club.";    The stunning videotape was recorded by
George Holliday, a plumber who was awakened about 12:30 a.m. Sunday by the
sound of police helicopters overhead. Holliday went to the terrace of his
second-story apartment and, seeing police in the street below, decided to get
some practice with his new videotape recorder.;    Witnesses said three or
four officers beat King in the two-minute tape, while as many as seven others
stood by to watch.;    "Please stop! Please stop!" King pleaded as he was
struck at least 40 times with police batons, said witness Dorothy Gibson.;   
King is black. The races of the police officers involved have not been
revealed. King said he didn't hear any racial comments from the officers.;   
"They beat me so bad I didn't pay attention to what they were saying," said
King, who had been released from jail in December after serving 2 1/2 years on
a second-degree robbery conviction.;    "When I saw it on TV, I thought, 'Is
this something happening in South Africa or Kuwait?' " said Keith Huling, 35,
who lives in the same apartment complex as Holliday. "Then I looked a little
closer, and said, 'Hey, that's the park across the street.' ";    Police have
said King resisted arrest. Witnesses have said he did not.;    Huling said he
knows of other police beatings that he believes are racially motivated. A
prevailing sense in his neighborhood this week, he said, is that "if I come
home from work and make a turn on a red light, I'm going to get my butt
kicked.";    The perception that non-Anglos are the targets of police
brutality has been chronic here.;    "Whether that's a perception or a reality
is almost beside the point, because the perception is the reality," said Zev
Yaroslavsky, a councilman who has requested public hearings on brutality
throughout the city. "I am troubled by the fact that when I learned the person
beaten was black, I wasn't surprised. . . . It is rare that there's an Anglo
that gets the crap beat out of him with a billy club.";    Yaroslavsky pointed
to recent incidents of harassment of black people. Just last December,
businessman and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes was handcuffed during a routine
traffic stop. The police department's subsequent apology to him came on the
heels of a federal jury award of $540,000 to former major league baseball
player Joe Morgan, who said Los Angeles police in 1988 had grabbed him by the
neck, thrown him to the ground and cuffed him at Los Angeles International
Airport when they thought he was a drug courier.

Prosecutors refused to immediately charge a man whose beating by police was
played out in painful clarity on the screens of tens of millions of television

ground, struggling to his hands and knees, then writhing on the ground under a
hail of police night sticks and kicks. Witnesses said police also used a stun
gun on King. Three or four officers had at King in the two-minute tape, while
as many as seven others stood by to watch.;    King is black. The races of the

had been released from jail in December after serving 2 1/2 years on a
second-degree robbery conviction, had been pursued to the spot outside
Holliday's apartment by CHP and Los Angeles officers in a chase police said
reached speeds over 110 mph. Before his release Wednesday, the father of two
reportedly lay in the county jail's hospital ward with a broken jaw, broken
leg, disfigured face and badly bruised body.;    "When I saw it on TV, I

year has received 531 complaints of police misconduct, including 127 involving
officers in the LAPD, according to Karol Heppe, the non-profit organization's
executive director. The total number of complaints is 75 percent higher than
it was at this time last year, Heppe said.;    The complaints range from
illegal search and seizure to verbal abuse to death, Heppe said. Most do not
lead to prosecution.;    "The only difference between those and this one is
that this one was caught on videotape," she said.;    Heppe lamented that the
Los Angeles police chief's attitude does not enhance the department's
reputation. Among the racial controversies he has stirred was the suggestion
that blacks die in choke holds because they have abnormal necks.;    The
ACLU's Hicks said the organization plans today to ask for Gates' resignation.

nothing to interpretation, (and) probably is the one event that may sensitize"
the politicians.;    The Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service so far this
year has received 531 complaints of police misconduct, including 127 involving
officers in the LAPD, according to Karol Heppe, the non-profit organization's
executive director. The total number of complaints is 75 percent higher than
it was at this time last year, Heppe said.;    The complaints range from
illegal search and seizure to verbal abuse to death, Heppe said. Most do not
lead to prosecution.;    "The only difference between those and this one is
that this one was caught on videotape," she said.;    Heppe lamented that the
Los Angeles police chief's attitude does not enhance the department's
reputation. Among the racial controversies he has stirred was the suggestion
that blacks die in choke holds because they have abnormal necks.;    The
ACLU's Hicks said the organization plans today to ask for Gates' resignation.

  BEATING CRUNCHED BONES, FRIEND SAYS

As Rodney G. King was beaten by Los Angeles Police officers on March 3, other
officers seized one of King's passengers, Bryant Allen, who says he was
manhandled and taunted in a racially motivated attempt to provoke him.;    In
an interview, Allen said he feared for his life as he was made to crawl along
the ground, hearing at the same time his friend's screams and the sounds of
police batons from the far side of the car.  
</P>
<P>
"He was screaming, 'Stop!' " said Allen, who said he heard but did not see
his friend being beaten. "Then he kind of quit, and all you could hear was
like bones being broken, a crunching, like a whip sound.";    In the first
complete account of the incident from one who was there, Allen, 25, said he
believed the beating of King and the blows directed at him and a second
passenger, Freddie Helms, were racially motivated.;    All three men in the
car were black. The police officers were white. As many as 21 Los Angeles
police officers were present; a sergeant and three officers have been indicted
on assault charges.;    Allen's lawyer, John C. Burton, said he would file a
federal civil rights suit. King's lawyer said Tuesday he also would file a
suit. None of the three men in the car has been charged.;    Allen tapped his
foot slowly as he sat with his lawyer Tuesday night, watching for the first
time the full seven-minute videotape, which includes the two-minute beating
that has been shown repeatedly on national television.;    The videotape has
led to calls for the resignation of Chief Daryl F. Gates and prompted
inquiries into the extent of police brutality nationwide.;    Speaking
quietly, Allen described King's erratic behavior behind the wheel on a night
when the three men had been drinking beer and said tension was heightened when
King had trouble with his seat belt as he was complying with police orders to
leave his car.;    He said that at one point a female officer intervened when
he himself was threatened with violence. "She's the one who had her hand out
saying I didn't do anything wrong," Allen recalled. She was saying, 'He's the
one that had his hands up.' ";    Nevertheless, he said, he was kicked and
manhandled, and Allen said he was threatened by officers who said: "You want
to be like your home boy? You want to be like your home boy?";    When the
beating was over, the police officers left him and Helms standing by the side
of the road, he said. "They said, 'Guess what?' I said, 'What?' They said,
'You're in a Crips neighborhood.' They laughed and took off.";    Allen said
he and his friends, all unemployed, came from a neighborhood claimed by the
Bloods, a rival to the Crips gang.;    Since the incident, he said, he had
spoken twice with King, 25, who suffered multiple fractures and what his
lawyer said may be permanent brain damage. King initially declined to
characterize the incident as racial.;    On his recent visits, he said, King
was having difficulty remembering the night of the beating in a coherent way.
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like he was talking in riddles, all mixed up," Allen said.;    As
Allen recalls it, the late-night incident began with the three men speeding
down the Foothill Freeway in northern Los Angeles at what might have been as
fast as 80 miles an hour. Burton said the men had each drunk a 40-ounce bottle
of Old English 800 malt liquor.;    Burton said, "Drugs had absolutely nothing
to do with this incident." Medical tests also showed that King was free of
drugs.;    After visiting at Allen's house, King told his friends he was
taking them to a park where he had gone in the past with his father.;    When
he saw the flashing lights of a California Highway Patrol car behind them,
Allen said: "I told him, 'Rodney, pull over, stop.' He just kept on going,
kept on driving.;    "I thought he was pulling over, but he was going down the
off-ramp. We stopped at the stop sign, and then we were driving again. I said,
'Rodney, pull over.' We were still driving, and the lights were flashing. I
could hear a lot of cars." Their small white Hyundai was surrounded by police
cars and illuminated by the glare of headlights. It was at this point, he
said, that the other passenger, Helms, who had been asleep in the front seat,
woke up.;    "The police ordered us, 'Driver, put your hands out the window,"'
Allen continued. "They said, 'Take your left hand outside the door and step
out.' Rodney had the seat belt, and it kind of yanked him back. The police
were getting nervous too. They told him to lie flat down, and he lay flat
down.";    Allen said he and Helms left the car on the opposite side, beside a
large, dark park, and also lay down.;    "The police put the handcuffs on me,
and that's when I heard Rodney screaming," Allen went on. "He was screaming
like he was getting a whupping.";    After the screaming stopped, he said, he
continued to hear the whipping sound of the nightsticks through the clatter of
a hovering helicopter.

<P>
Motorist Rodney King's night of terror at the hands of baton-wielding officers
began with California Highway Patrol officers flagging him down and promising
that he wouldn't be hurt if he stopped.;    It ended in the hospital March 3
with 11 broken bones in his skull, a leg fracture and other injuries suffered
while being hit 56 times in a rain of baton blows and kicks.  
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of confidential documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times
indicate that officers who stopped the Altadena motorist played down his
injuries in their official reports.;    But Highway Patrol officers at the
scene told investigators that they were shocked by the ferocity of the
beating.;    Police have now determined that 21 Los Angeles police officers
were at the scene, instead of 15 as initially reported. There were also three
Highway Patrol officers and two school police officers.;    Police officers,
unaware that they had been videotaped by an amateur video buff, said in their
reports that King suffered cuts and bruises "of a minor nature.";    In
contrast, the Highway Patrol officers were so taken aback that they jotted
down Los Angeles officers' names.;    "I didn't see any need to hit him with a
baton," Officer Melanie Singer of the Highway Patrol later told
investigators.;    The conflicting accounts are contained in hundreds of pages
of confidential police reports, witness interviews and other official law
enforcement materials collected by investigators and studied by the county
grand jury, which indicted a sergeant and three officers last week.;    In
"use of force" reports submitted by Sgt. Stacey Koon and officers Laurence M.
</P>
<P>
Powell and Timothy Wind, King's injuries were listed as "contusions and
abrasions.";    They also marked boxes on the use of force reports saying King
"attacked officers," "continued some resistance" and "increased his
resistance." The videotape shows that King was often in a defenseless
position.;    The grand jury indicted Koon, Powell, Wind and Officer Ted
Briseno on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and beating a suspect under
color of authority. Koon and Powell were also charged with filing a false
police report.;    After the arrest, Koon wrote in his daily report that
reinforcements are needed to ensure a suspect's submission because sometimes
batons and electric stun guns don't work the way they are supposed to.;   
Highway Patrol Officers Tim and Melanie Singer said they saw the first
half-dozen blows inflicted on King. Another Highway Patrol officer, Gabriel
Aid, said he arrived after King was hogtied. Aid said one Los Angeles police
officer asked him, "Did you get any blood on your hands?";    The Singers, a
husband-and-wife team, saw King when he and two passengers were driving on
Interstate 210 at what Melanie Singer estimated were speeds of up to 100 mph.;
She said King refused to stop, even after her husband advised him over
their car bullhorn: "Pull over to the right. We won't hurt you.";    Los
Angeles police joined the pursuit. Melanie Singer said that, when King got out
of the car, he appeared jovial, dancing and "heavily intoxicated." One
passenger in King's car said they had been drinking malt liquor.;    As
Melanie Singer approached King, she said Koon told her, "No, no. Get back.
</P>
<P>
We'll handle." She said Koon shot King twice with a Taser stun gun, and King
stumbled to the ground.;    "Officer Powell ran up and struck the suspect on
the right side of his head with his baton," she told investigators. "The
suspect clasped his hands to his face and screamed with pain. He was bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Powell then struck him five to six more times in rapid succession in the head
and neck area.";    She described the blows as "causing his face to split.";  
At that point, she said, another Los Angeles police officer grabbed Powell's
arm to stop him, and Koon yelled at Powell, "Stop! Stop! That's enough!";   
"Mr. King appeared to be less resistive," she recalled. "I considered him
disabled.";    None of the Los Angeles officers gave King instructions, she
said.

physical treatment, were part of an attempt to provoke him.;    Asked why else
he thought the incident was racial, he added, "Three blacks in a car, all
white policemen, the way they look at us.";    Since the incident, he said, he
had spoken twice with King, who suffered multiple fractures and what his
lawyer said may be permanent brain damage. King initially declined to
characterize the incident as racial.;    King can't seem to remember;  He and
King, who is also 25, have known each other at least since they were 13, Allen
said.;    On his recent visits, he said, King was having difficulty
remembering the night of the beating in a coherent way. "It sounded like he

five minutes, with the patrol car behind them, during which time he continued
to urge him to pull over.;    'Rodney, stop';  "We stopped at a red light and
took off again. We came to another red light. I told him, 'Rodney, stop,' and
he finally went to pull over and he stopped.";    Their small white Hyundai
was surrounded by police cars and illuminated by the glare of headlights.;

officers in Los Angeles use standard-issue PR-24 aluminum nightsticks that are
24 inches long and weigh 27 ounces.;    "They made me crawl a certain way, to
scoot. I was flat down. I was definitely frightened. I thought I was going to
get shot or something.";    By that time, he said, King had stopped screaming.

"I just closed my eyes," Allen said. "Whatever was happening to him, I didn't
want to see."

  MOTORIST BEATEN BY COPS WORRIES ABOUT PAIN,
SCARS  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six weeks after his beating by Los Angeles police - and seemingly forgotten
in the political turmoil that has followed - Rodney G. King fears
retribution, spends most of his time seeing doctors, and thinks a lot about
the headaches, scars and facial numbness he worries might become permanent.;  
A man who was always concerned about his looks, and particularly fussy about
his teeth, King is depressed about his appearance and will likely need more
surgery to minimize scars on the right side of his face, his plastic surgeon
and ex-wife said last week.  
</P>
<P>
King, who never enjoyed sitting at home, now leads a sedentary, largely
secluded life, venturing out with a wheelchair and cane mainly for medical
treatment. Never much of a bookworm, the 25-year-old laborer and high school
dropout does not even enjoy television these days because "every time he turns
on the TV, he sees something on it" about the beating, ex-wife Dennetta King
said.;    "He's depressed, he's scared," she said, adding that she speaks with
King about twice a week, mainly about their daughters. "That's about all he
talks about.";    "He's depressed because they beat him like that and he feels
that his manhood has been taken, and he's scared because he doesn't know if
they're going to try to beat him up again or kill him or what," she said.;   
Dennetta King said her ex-husband has been staying at a series of undisclosed,
private homes with family members because of threats.;    King's attorney,
Steven Lerman of Beverly Hills, said he has hired security guards to "watch
(out) for him.";    Lerman has filed an $83 million claim against the city on
King's behalf. Three Los Angeles police officers and a sergeant have been
indicted on charges of excessive force in the case, while investigations
continue into the culpability of 17 other officers present.;    Although the
March 3 videotaped beating has been replayed across the country and overseas,
igniting an unprecedented political war within city government and a series of
investigations, King himself has avoided publicity.;    Lerman said he has
declined all requests for interviews with King from reporters because "I don't
feel he's in any kind of shape to be seen.";    King's neat, blue home in
Altadena has the curtains drawn, its phone number and those of other family
members long changed. Neighbors say they do not hear from King directly, and
only occasionally catch word that "he's doing OK" or "getting by.";    King
suffers from painful headaches, and numbness on the right side of his face
where the bones of his cheek and eye were fractured "like an eggshell," said
his plastic surgeon, Dr. Alvin Reiter.;    King's bones appear to be healing
well after five hours of reconstructive surgery March 14, Reiter said. The
natural tightening of the skin during the healing process has created
"significant bumps and depressions" on King's face that probably will require
more surgery.;    "He's very concerned about what he's going to look like,"
Reiter said.;    Dennetta King said Rodney was always proud of his good looks
and used to take longer than her to wash and dress. "He loves his teeth and
face," she said. "He brushed quite a bit, and used to get on the girls all the
time about brushing their teeth. He believed in pretty teeth.";    King
remains under investigation in the Feb. 21 armed robbery of a Los Angeles
video store. Los Angeles police have acknowledged he became a suspect in the
case, in which a store clerk was shot in the shoulder, only after the March 3
beating when his photograph was widely broadcast on television. He is on
parole for a 1989 robbery of a Monterey Park grocer.

Some of the police officers who stood by while others beat black motorist
Rodney King maintain "to this day" that his traffic stop was handled properly,
District Attorney Ira Reiner said Friday.;    The revelation came in Reiner's
announcement that the county's grand jury had decided not to indict the
bystanders because no state laws make their inaction criminal. Reiner said he
is referring the case to the U.S. attorney for review under federal civil
rights laws, which are broader than California's.  
</P>
<P>
Near the end of his prepared statement, the district attorney said that
"while many of the bystander officers were deeply disturbed by what occurred,
. . . to this day, some of the officers present do not acknowledge that the
incident should have been handled any differently than it was.";    Because
the beating still is under investigation, he declined to elaborate or answer
reporters' questions. But he said he would forward the "disturbing interviews"
to the local independent commission investigating the police department. The
commission has no disciplinary power.;    "I couldn't be more disappointed,"
said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a city council candidate and executive director of
this area's chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. "We had
expectations that these lawbreakers - and passive though they may have been,
they were lawbreakers - would be dealt with accordingly. . . . We have not
given up on this.";    The American Civil Liberties Union plans to see whether
it can take any legal action on the grand jury's decision.;    "Some of these
officers have strongly defended the activities surrounding Rodney King . . .
which is an incredible thing to say under investigation," ACLU spokesman Joe
Hicks said. "We do not have a lot of confidence in the justice department and
(its) past record of investigation and prosecution of police abuse around the
country.";    The Los Angeles Times reported that the grand jury heard from
seven officers, including five rookies who witnessed King's arrest. The
rookies said the scene that night was chaotic and noisy, that King appeared
dangerous and possibly high on PCP, and that the sergeant there seemed to be
in charge. Officers reportedly weren't asked why they did not try to stop the
beating.;    In his statement, Reiner said that "however morally wrong their
failure to intercede, in California law, there is no criminal statute under
which these officers can be indicted. . . . Because the behavior of the
bystander officers was both irresponsible and offensive, and in light of the
unprecedented public furor over this case, the grand jury is to be commended
for remaining true to their duty.";    King's March 3 beating, captured on
videotape, spawned outrage throughout the world and led to criminal charges by
the grand jury against four Los Angeles Police Department officers.;    Police
Chief Daryl Gates earlier this week fired one of the officers, a rookie still
on probation, and suspended the other three without pay pending hearings that
could lead to their dismissal.;    Besides those four, at least 17 other LAPD
officers were present at the scene of the beating. There also were two from
the California Highway Patrol and two from the Los Angeles Unified School
District.;    The police department's internal investigation of its bystanders
is continuing, Cmdr. Rick Dinse said. While he would not discuss the
investigation or its results, Dinse said that behavior "doesn't have to be
criminal for us to take action.";    Only the police chief has the power,
after extensive review, to discipline officers. Whether Chief Gates will be
the one to rule on these officers remains a question. A Superior Court judge
is reviewing whether the city's police commission had the right to put Gates
on leave last month, and whether the city council has the right to reinstate
him.
