[By XINHUA correspondent Feng Xiuju: "Patten's Bill 
Passage, a Long Premeditated Action"] 
Beijing, February 26 (XINHUA) - The recent passage 
of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's partial electoral bill by 
its Legislative Council (Legco) was not accidental, but long 
premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
The step was taken in disregard of repeated persuasion by 
China and the aspirations of all the social strata in Hong Kong 
for a settlement of the electoral arrangements through talks. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, the British side also published a 
white paper and unilaterally made public the contents of last 
year's 17 rounds of Sino-British talks on the arrangements for 
the 1994-1995 elections in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Hong Kong Government gazetted the remaining 
part of Patten's reform package on Friday [25 February]. 
</P>
<P>
This string of actions is the inevitable result of the 
change 
of Britain's policies toward China and its stubborn perseverance 
in violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle 
of convergence with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and the relevant agreements and 
understandings reached between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
These actions fully show that the British side has closed 
the 
door of negotiations between the two sides and is finally taking 
a road of confrontation with China on the issue of Hong Kong's 
political system. 
</P>
<P>
None of the Chinese people, including the Hong Kong 
compatriots, can ever tolerate such kind of actions. 
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that shortly after Patten became Hong 
Kong 
governor in 1992, he began to sell his political bill step by 
step under the pretence of increasing democracy in Hong Kong, in 
an attempt to change Hong Kong's present political structure and 
pull the pro-British elements and those who are opposed to China 
onto the political stage, so as to turn Hong Kong into an 
independent or semi-independent political entity which cannot be 
controlled by the central government of China after 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The following facts clearly show his real intention. 
</P>
<P>
First, Patten tabled his political reform bill in October, 
1992, in a sudden manner, without consulting with China, thus 
sabotaging the Sino-British consultations and cooperation of the 
past ten years since they negotiated and signed the joint 
declaration, and bringing about a half-year-long open argument 
between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Then Britain, under all sorts of pressure, agreed to hold 
talks with China in April last year on the arrangements for 
elections for 1994/1995 in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
However, at the negotiating table the British side 
repeatedly 
adopted double-faced tactics. It spoke fine words while 
blocking the progress of talks by setting up various barriers. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the talks could not be moved forward. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when the two sides almost reached identical views on 
the arrangements for elections of municipal councils and the 
district boards, the British side intentionally confused these 
elections with that of the Legislative Council and unilaterally 
terminated the talks and then introduced the first part of the 
package to the Legislative Council last December. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, China made it clear repeatedly that for the Chinese 
side the door for negotiations was open, with the prerequisite 
that the British side must withdraw the submitted partial bill 
from the Legco. 
</P>
<P>
But the British side ignored this and was the first to walk 
away from the negotiating table, thus completely closing the 
door of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned facts demonstrate that the British side 
has had no sincerity at all on cooperation with China in the 
three crucial periods, namely, prior to the talks, in the 
process of the talks and leading to the break-down of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, it has walked far along the road of 
confrontation with China. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Patten made a special trip to Australia and tried 
his best to win support from outside Hong Kong for the passage 
and the implementation of his political bill. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Patten returned to Hong Kong at the end of his 
trip to Australia on February 19, his partial electoral bill was 
passed by the Legislative Council. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain also issued a white paper. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year or more, Patten has directed so many 
farces which converged so closely that it is clear that what he 
did was carefully arranged and long premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
The British side time and again said that Patten's political 
bill was aimed at promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability 
and completely considered the aspirations of the Hong Kong 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity 
and stability and to ensure its smooth transition in 1997 are in 
the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law was formulated after more than four years' 
discussions and drafting, and fully absorbing opinions of the 
Hong Kong residents. Its most important principle is to 
maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 
</P>
<P>
The preamble and the general principles of the Basic Law 
stipulate that the socialist system and policies shall not be 
practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and 
the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain 
unchanged for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Article 45 and article 68 of the Basic Law also stipulate 
that Hong Kong's political system should be developed "in the 
light of the actual situation" and "in accordance with the 
principle of gradual and orderly progress". 
</P>
<P>
These principles aim at precisely guaranteeing Hong Kong's 
stable development, stable transfer of its power, and steady 
establishment of the government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and Legislative Council. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the principles in the Basic Law accepted by the 
Hong Kong residents conform to the fundamental interests and 
opinions of the Hong Kong people. 
</P>
<P>
However, Patten hurriedly put forward his political reform 
bill less than three months after he began to serve as Hong Kong 
governor, without absorbing opinions from the Hong Kong 
residents. More serious was that, despite strong appeals from 
Hong Kong residents for the settlement of the electoral 
arrangements through talks, the political reform bill submitted 
by Patten was passed. How can people say that it reflects the 
opinions and interests of the Hong Kong residents? 
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law 
stipulate that the British administration of Hong Kong will 
terminate on June 30, 1997, and the Chinese Government will 
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of July 1, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
In accordance with these provisions, the Chinese side has 
reiterated that as component parts of the British political body 
administering Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district 
boards, the two municipal polls and the Legislative Council will 
definitely be terminated together with the end of the British 
administration of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Chinese and British sides reach an agreement on 
the arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections, the three-level 
bodies produced on the basis of the partial electoral bill 
passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or any other electoral 
bill possibly yet to be passed by the Legco cannot remain beyond 
the year 1997. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a vain fantasy to think that the passed bill 
will 
be fixed in the form of law and the three-level bodies produced 
from the bill can be automatically extended beyond the year 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Time is advancing and the destiny of Hong Kong in future 
will 
be in the hands of the Chinese people, including the Hong Kong 
compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how far the British side will walk along the road 
of confrontation with China on the issue of Hong Kong's 
political system, it absolutely cannot prevent the progress of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
China holds that as long as the Hong Kong compatriots and 
the 
mainland people closely cooperate and completely implement the 
principle of "one country, two systems", the future of Hong Kong 
will be bright.

   Commentary Criticizes Patten `Asset' Theory

["Special commentary" by Yu Yen (0205 6056): "Playing the 
`International Card' Is of No Avail-Commenting on Chris 
Patten's `International Asset' Theory"] 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten returned to Hong 
Kong in a huff after spending his holidays and making several 
visits in Australia. In an interview with the media on the last 
day of his stay in Australia, he went so far as to say that 
Chinese officials do not understand the international status and 
importance of Hong Kong so their criticism of him does not 
conform to reality, adding that Hong Kong is an "international 
asset" as well as China's asset. 
</P>
<P>
What is the purpose of Chris Patten's trip to Australia? 
</P>
<P>
Though he repeatedly argued in his defense that he did not go 
to Australia in search of support for his constitutional 
package, the fact he talked a great deal about his 
constitutional package and requested Australia to pass on 
"genuine democracy" to Hong Kong reveals that he visited 
Australia to seek international support for this constitutional 
package, of which the first part will be put to the vote, after 
his constitutional package had drawn sharp criticism and came in 
for questioning at the British Parliamentary Foreign Affairs 
Committee hearings. The Australian Government and public, 
however, gave him and his constitutional package the cold 
shoulder and many media units and Chinese organizations even 
severely criticized him. Only one or two government officers, 
who do not know anything about the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law, supported him verbally. When 
commenting on this, a Chinese official pointed out: While Patten 
is playing the international card, it is extremely inappropriate 
for Australian Government officials to make irresponsible 
remarks. This criticism hit the vital spot. In reponse, Patten 
showed his ignorance and arrogance, once again proving that the 
British Government is bent on making the Hong Kong issue an 
international one before evacuating Hong Kong and changing Hong 
Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity, 
to extend the influence of its colonial rule. 
</P>
<SUB_HEAD>  Sovereignty Over Hong Kong Cannot Be Evaded 
</SUB_HEAD>
<P>
Ostensibly, some people feel Governor Patten's remarks, 
quoted at the beginning of this article, were made in praise of 
Hong Kong and in defense of Hong Kong's international status and 
its importance. However, a rough analysis shows the matter is 
not so simple. In saying Hong Kong is an international asset, 
Patten intentionally evaded the problem of to whom Hong Kong 
belongs. According to Patten, since Hong Kong is an 
"international asset," it belongs to the international 
community, namely, it is shared by every country in the world or 
at least it is an independent or semi-independent political 
entity, over which China cannot exercise sovereignty. Does this 
not clearly show that China's sovereignty over Hong Kong was 
evaded or even denied? 
</P>
<P>
How can China's sovereignty over Hong Kong be evaded! Since 
ancient times Hong Kong has been an inseparable part of Chinese 
territory. This is a fact known to all. Hong Kong was "ceded" 
and "leased" by the corrupt Qing Government to the "Great 
British Empire" when the latter sent in overpowering warships 
and cannons in its invasion of China, so it was in fact "stolen" 
or forcibly "occupied" by Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Though Britain has ruled over Hong Kong for one and a half 
centuries, the fact that Hong Kong is China's sacred territory 
will never change. The Chinese nation has gone through a good 
deal, so the Chinese people value the country's sovereignty all 
the more. The Chinese Government and people have never 
acknowledged the unequal treaty signed at the point of a 
bayonet. It is for this reason that Deng Xiaoping has said on 
many occasions: "China refuses to yield an inch on the 
territory problem. To put it bluntly, sovereignty is not a 
problem for discussion." These sonorous and forceful remarks 
most vividly highlight and express the common desire of the 
Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots. 
</P>
<SUB_HEAD>  Attempt To Turn Hong Kong into International Wrestling Ring 
</SUB_HEAD>
<P>
Before the Chinese people, who refuse to be bullied again, 
Patten's attempt to evade and deny the fact that Hong Kong 
belongs to China by saying Hong Kong is an "international asset" 
is of no avail. 
</P>
<P>
What merits attention is that this was not the first time 
Patten has referred to Hong Kong as an "international asset." 
In early May last year, he openly alleged that Hong Kong was an 
"international asset" in a speech in Washington. To echo this 
assertion, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in both 
Singapore and Jakarta last July that Hong Kong had become a 
"political city." The two used different terms but they meant 
the same thing. They tried to change Hong Kong into an 
international political wrestling ring in a bid to throw Hong 
Kong into confusion, cripple Hong Kong's superiority as an 
international financial center, and rely on international forces 
to prevent China regaining sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Patten's allegation that the Chinese side does not 
understand Hong Kong's "international status" is entirely 
nonsense. How can Patten be compared with the Chinese Government 
where the understanding of Hong Kong's international status and 
its importance are concerned. It is because the Chinese 
Government has a profound and accurate understanding of Hong 
Kong's past and present state, and its international status, 
that it was able to advance a series of principles and policies 
including "one country, two systems," "allowing Hong Kong people 
to administer Hong Kong and enjoy a high degree of autonomy," 
and so on to solve Hong Kong problems. The fact that the 
Chinese Government included the series of principles and 
policies into the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which was made 
known to the world, giving them concrete form and putting them 
on a legal basis in the Basic Law, vividly indicates that the 
Chinese Government has a penetrating understanding of Hong 
Kong's "international status." Undoubtedly, a city's 
international status and functions are entirely different from 
the issue of to which country it belongs. They are different 
concepts and cannot be lumped together. Hong Kong is ranked 
among the biggest international cities and has become one of the 
international economic, trade, financial, and shipping centers 
but this will never change the fact that it is part of Chinese 
territory. The same is ture of New York, Paris, and Tokyo: 
They are international big cities but nobody can deny that they 
belong to the United States, France, and Japan respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly Patten has an axe to grind in preaching the 
"international asset" theory. By falsely alleging that the 
Chinese side does not understand Hong Kong's international 
status, he obviously was trying to shift public attention, cheat 
the media, and lure the international community into meddling in 
Hong Kong affairs, thus finally attaining the goal of 
internationalizing the Hong Kong issue. 
</P>
<SUB_HEAD>  The British Side Has Attempted To Prolong Colonial Rule for 
a Long Time 
</SUB_HEAD>
<P>
Internationalizing the Hong Kong issue is one of the British 
Government's important plans to continue its colonial rule over 
Hong Kong after 1997 and is also one of its concentrated 
examples of going back on its word after signing the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has been unhappy, unconscious, and even unwilling to 
return Hong Kong to China. At the beginning they said "the 
three treaties remain effective," later they suggested 
"exchanging sovereignty for administrative power," and then they 
proposed "Sino- British joint administration." All these showed 
their reluctance to give up colonial rule and return Hong Kong 
to China. 
</P>
<P>
Former British Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher laid bare in her 
memoirs Britain's three-step strategy for handling the Hong Kong 
issue. First, insisting that Britain enjoy sovereignty over a 
part of Hong Kong; second, exchanging sovereignty over Hong Kong 
for long-term administrative power; and third, developing a 
democratic structure with the aim of granting Hong Kong 
independence or autonomy in a short period in the same way they 
treated Singapore, if the above two steps proved unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Chinese people, who had risen to their feet, the 
first two steps have gone to the wall, so they are now stepping 
up implementation of the third step by taking advantage of their 
administrative power. People are now clear that everything, 
including the "representative government system," "the right of 
abode in the United Kingdom," the "formation of the court of 
final appeal," and "introducing the committee system into the 
Legislative Council" was closely related with to the third step. 
</P>
<P>
What Patten has said and done since he arrived in Hong Kong, 
including the "international card," has been designed to 
meticulously carry through the third step laid down by the 
British Government. This is exactly what is meant by the 
Chinese saying: He who has come, has come with ill intent, 
certainly not on virtue bent. This is the soft tactic Britain, 
which was a great empire over 100 years ago but is now on the 
wane, is forced to apply when it can no longer be insufferably 
arrogant before the giant in the east-the powerful People's 
Republic of China. According to Percy Cradock's memoirs, Mrs 
Thatcher once spoke of the need to appoint a politician as the 
last Hong Kong governor. This was because only a politician can 
achieve a certain political objective; can be impudent and break 
his promises; can contradict himself and chop and change; and 
can stop at nothing and risk danger in his desperation to carry 
out his plan. Patten has acted this way since he came to Hong 
Kong. Therefore, Patten's behavior is not personal but reflects 
a change in Britain's policy toward Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone says Mr Patten has loafed around and wandered 
about 
doing nothing since he arrived in Hong Kong, this is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, making nothing of the hardships, he 
has traveled to many countries to enlist support for his 
constitutional package in a move to internationalize the Hong 
Kong issue. During his recent trip to Australia, apart from 
saying that Hong Kong was an "international asset," he claimed 
that for various countries to support Hong Kong in expanding 
democracy is not equivalent to interfering in China's internal 
affairs. He also called on the international community to see 
to it that China honor its commitment after 1997 and alleged 
that Britain bears a "moral responsibility" for Hong Kong, and 
so on. All this thoroughly exposes Britain's plan to 
internationalize the Hong Kong issue. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is internationally accepted that while the 
Hong Kong issue is a matter for both China and Britain before 
1997, it is purely a Chinese internal affair after 1997. So any 
attempts by Patten and Britain to make the Hong Kong issue an 
international one are doomed to failure.

["Random Notes on Hong Kong" by Zhong Yan (6988 1693): 
"Confession by the Last Governor of Hong Kong"] 
Recently, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten published 
an article entitled "Go Against the North Wind." The meaning is 
quite clear: To go against China through to the end on the Hong 
Kong issue. 
</P>
<P>
Why has Chris Patten no scruples about declaring his stand 
of 
going against China through to the end? Just as he said in his 
article, the reason is that what he has done since he became 
governor of Hong Kong has been criticized and condemned not only 
by China and people of Hong Kong, but also by people in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
He said: "Some criticisms have appeared in both Britain and 
Hong Kong." But he also found excuses to console himself: "In 
an open and free society, such criticisms may appear." As a 
mater of fact, if there had only been "some" criticisms, there 
was no need for the governor to personally write such a long 
article to explain himself over such trifles. 
</P>
<P>
The most important point of the article is that Chris Patten 
was trying hard to explain that all he had done was in the 
interests of the Hong Kong people. He wrote: "Our 
responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong should be put 
first." This British Hong Kong governor is really more 
concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people. For this 
reason, he feels it unfair that the Hong Kong people are 
criticizing and condemning him instead of saying thank you to 
him. But for the Hong Kong people, of course the Hong Kong 
Chinese, what should be put first is certainly that they should 
be treated as real Chinese people of China rather than a 
conquered people in a colony, and the first responsibility of 
Britain is to ensure a smooth return of Hong Kong to China in 
accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong 
advocated by Chris Patten is actually for the colonialist 
interests of the British Empire. Some people criticized what he 
had done as "jeopardizing more extensive Sino-British 
relations." To refute this criticism he said: "Hong Kong is 
the biggest and most important component part of these 
relations." What is more, "judging from a long-term point of 
view, our position in China and Asia may, to a great extent, be 
decided by how we discharge our responsibility in Hong Kong in a 
dignified manner." 
People cannot but ask: Why is Hong Kong the biggest and most 
important part of Sino-British relations? To the Chinese 
people, the following is understandable: Hong Kong was 
plundered after the Opium War, a war of aggression launched by 
Britain against China. The Chinese people will never forget this 
national humiliation. If this humiliation is not wiped out, 
there can be no harmonious Sino- British relations. 
</P>
<P>
However, this is obviously not what Chris Patten meant. Then 
what did he mean by saying Hong Kong is the "biggest and most 
important" part of Sino-British relations? Did he mean that the 
British Empire will not resign itself to the return of its 
richest colony to China, the rightful owner? 
</P>
<P>
People will also ask: Why will the position of Britain in 
China and Asia be decided by how Britain discharges its 
responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner? What 
position does Britain want to have in China and in Asia? What 
is the meaning of a "dignified manner"? If Britain ensures a 
smooth return of Hong Kong to China in accordance with the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, is it not a practice in a 
"dignified manner?" Can it not help improve the image of 
Britain and increase its position in China and Asia? Does 
Britain really want to return Hong Kong to China only in name 
while preserving its position as the "governor" to show the 
power and prestige of the British Empire and go on playing the 
tyrant in China and Asia as a colonialist? In this respect, 
what Chris Patten meant is quite clear. 
</P>
<P>
In his article, Chris Patten brutally attacked China as a 
"villain." In fact, this is the right word for Mr. Patten 
himself. He threatened that if China did not obey the 
"governor's" arrangement, it should not expect Britain would 
agree to its return to GATT. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chris Patten has taken great pains to protect the 
interests of the British Empire, he is not admired by some 
domestic opinion. Instead, he has been criticized and 
condemned. That is why he feels somewhat wronged. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, has been 
trying 
hard to preserve an actual colonial position in Hong Kong and 
revitalize the colonialist power and prestige of the old British 
Empire. Unfortunately, all this is but a day dream. 
</P>
<P>
This article is actually a confession by Chris Patten, who 
has been driven to the wall, to prove his loyalty to British 
colonialism.

[Article by Hong Qingtian (3163 3237 3944): "China, Britain, 
Hong Kong At Crossroads of History"] 
[Excerpts] Patten Poses Seven Challenges to China in 
Second Annual Report-Patten's New Tactics and Challenges to 
China 
1. Abandoning his "from politics to politics" stance, which 
is that politics is self-justifying and self-sufficient, Patten 
has now woven politics into the lives of the people of Hong 
Kong, making it part and parcel of the local way of life and 
inseparable from the war on corruption, the rule of law, 
freedom, education, and the quality of governance - all 
"perennial concerns" in Chinese society.  
</P>
<P>
The way Christopher Patten talked last year, you would have 
thought he were in Britain. Now Patten takes life in Hong Kong 
as his point of departure, arguing that democratic politics of a 
high quality are what the people of Hong Kong need to maintain 
the "Hong Kong system." How can the Chinese authorities be 
persuasive if they reject his argument? What alternative can the 
Chinese offer? If the Chinese come up with their own agenda, 
what must it contain that would invalidate the British position? 
</P>
<P>
How to sever the linkage between "politics" and the "Hong Kong 
way of life?" When Hong Kong fought for democracy in the 1980's, 
Xu Jiatun [6079 1367 1470] tried countering Hong Kong's 
capitalist primary democracy with advanced socialist democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently China rejected Hong Kong's political demands by 
questioning their timetable. After Patten came to Hong Kong, the 
Chinese could no longer keep acting anti-democratic. All they 
could do was to declare that they too were for democracy but 
that the dispute between China and Britain is not one over the 
extent of democracy but one involving trust between two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Patten has made politics an integral part of the life 
of the Hong Kong people and their institutions, can the Chinese 
continue to counter it with the argument that it is all a matter 
of trust between nations? 
2. In contrast to his past arrogance and wilfulness, Patten 
now says, "I have grown to like Hong Kong more and more. I have 
deep feelings for this place." He hopes that "as it advances 
with big strides into the 21st century, Hong Kong will be like a 
beacon, shining brightly as if to announce its glorious 
achievements. It will also set an excellent example 
demonstrating that in a system of freedom, people can 
successfully overcome all sorts of adversity and difficulties 
and, hand in hand, create a wonderful future." (Section 190) 
After the governor presented his first annual report to the 
Legislative Council last year, the Chinese authorities initially 
took a heavy-handed approach. It was so severe and threatening 
that it gave the impression China was prepared for mutual 
destruction, with Britain, Hong Kong, and itself all going down 
the tube. In doing so, the Chinese only succeeded in turning 
public opinion strongly against them. Even as public approval of 
Patten slipped and opposition rose, anti-Chinese feelings in 
Hong Kong also gained ground. Politically speaking, the Chinese 
paid dearly for opposing Patten. At the time the Chinese could 
convincingly attack Patten for his overbearing ways, arrogant, 
domineering, stubborn, and intractable. Now Patten has changed 
his attitudes. He may still be impenetrably thick-headed, but he 
has mellowed considerably and become more practical. What should 
be China's attitude now? If the Chinese try to be as mellow and 
practical as Patten, that may be interpreted as a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if they persist in their shrill ways, they may lose points. 
3. Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council 
is replete with praises for the people of Hong Kong, for their 
accomplishments, and for the superiority of the Hong Kong 
system, calling it a miracle of human society. The report also 
contains endless comparisons with Britain, Australia, and the 
Netherlands, countries which the local people are familiar with. 
</P>
<P>
Of course this is the stock in trade of politicians in every 
democratic country, but it also shows that the relationship 
between the ruler and the ruled under a democratic system is 
just what the people of Hong Kong need psychologically at this 
point in time. 
</P>
<P>
Having inherited the tradition of the Qing Dynasty and the 
Republic of China, the Chinese Communists have always considered 
Hong Kong alien land. It is hard for the Chinese to sing the 
praises of the Hong Kong system, Hong Kong people, and Hong Kong 
society. During the anti-Patten campaign last year, the Chinese 
opposed everything that was associated with Patten. What Patten 
said about Hong Kong's values and its superiority were all 
satirized by the Chinese media, so much so that one could hardly 
tell right from wrong anymore. The "anti-Patten" campaign came 
perilously close to being an "anti-Hong Kong" movement. The 
objective of the Chinese was to launch an all-out attack on 
Patten, stopping at nothing. In so doing, however, they in 
effect repudiated many of the values of the system of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
If China continues its negative attitude toward Hong Kong, what 
sort of price will it have to pay? If, on the other hand, it 
echoes Patten and begins heaping praises on Hong Kong and 
emulating the Hong Kong system, can the Chinese Government bring 
itself to do that? Would praising Hong Kong send a wrong message 
to the local people, misleading them into thinking that China 
would compromise with Patten and go along with him? Would that 
encourage "Hong Kong chauvinism?" 
4. Patten has modified his political reform proposals in two 
major ways. First, he has replaced functional groups with 
statutory bodies even as he insists that voting be based on the 
individual and reduces the overall number of voters from the 
2.70 million called for last year to 1 million. The second 
concession is that the electoral committee would be composed of 
four groups following the organizational model of the second 
legislative council after 1997 as spelled out in the Basic Law. 
</P>
<P>
Under Patten's original proposal, the committee was to be made 
up of popularly elected district representatives (in its 
entirety or to a large extent). Nevertheless, Patten sticks by 
his original plan to have the 400 members of the electoral 
committee be chosen through election. Moreover, this concession 
comes with strings attached; the proposal that elected 
representatives be allowed to serve out their terms beyond 1997 
(the "through train" concept) is part and parcel of his overall 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and China reopened negotiations in April mainly 
because public opinion forced them back to the conference table. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides knew full well the price of defying public wishes. 
</P>
<P>
They may not reach an agreement if they negotiate, but they are 
bound to lose if they don't even talk. Hong Kong people hope 
that something will come out of their talks. A dozen or so 
public opinion surveys by the Hong Kong Statistical and Business 
Research Council invariably came up with one finding: The people 
of Hong Kong want both sides to make concessions and reach an 
accord. Now that Patten has made the first move by taking the 
initiative to give way, naturally the public wants the Chinese 
side to make corresponding concessions in order to narrow the 
difference between the two sides. How should the Chinese 
Government respond? If they continue to insist that Patten is 
guilty of the "three violations" and refuse to make adjustments 
and concessions, they would have a lot of ideological work to do 
on the Hong Kong people, besides giving Patten a reason to 
withdraw from the talks. However, if they give way, they would 
be handing a victory to Patten. Patten's initial demand was an 
electorate of 2.7 million people. It has now been scaled back to 
1 million, still significantly more than the 200,000-300,000 
people who would have been eligible to cast votes for the 
original 21 functional seats. How extensive a concession should 
the Chinese make? What about the "through train" proposal? As 
the seven letters between the foreign ministers indicate, both 
sides agreed that the same electoral arrangements should remain 
in place from 1995 through 1999, allowing legislators elected in 
1995 to serve out their terms through 1999. Then came the 4 June 
tragedy of 1989 and the big victories scored by democratic 
groups in direct Legislative Council elections in 1991. The 
Chinese wavered on the "through train" idea and the British came 
up with their own set of arrangements for the 1995 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Since the controversy was triggered off by China's plan to scrap 
the "through train" proposal, would it make concessions on this 
very issue? 
5. Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council 
was an honest self-examination of his past commitments regarding 
the people's livelihood and the work that had been done. He 
talked about things he had accomplished and things he had not, 
laying it all out in an honest, earnest, and realistic way. One 
year after arriving in Hong Kong, Patten has certainly commanded 
much authority with his solid political ideas. More than that, 
his skills, language, and operating method as a politician as 
well as the closeness between him and the public have also set a 
standard that the leader of the post-1997 special administrative 
region [SAR] must meet. During the subsequent question period, 
Legislative Council members lined up to point out the errors in 
his report. Their exchange, complete with questions, answers, 
charges, and explanations, was democracy in action, live. 
</P>
<P>
Public statements by Chinese officials to this date still 
contain a lot of empty bureaucratic gobbledygook, devoid of a 
spirit of seeking truth from facts. They always lecture the 
masses on the omnipotence, all-knowingness, invincibility, 
infallibility, and greatness of government, instead of talking 
about self-restraint, self-discipline, and self-control. The 
real issues are never aired in the open. Patten demonstrates the 
modern Western political approach while the Chinese remain 
wedded to propagating the superiority of "big, complete, and 
all-powerful government" going back thousands of years. How 
should the Chinese respond to Patten's new methods indicative of 
a modern open society? Should they throw a tantrum and pick a 
fight with Patten over this? Or should they take a leaf from 
Patten's book and try to communicate with the masses using 
similar methods? Would the SAR chief after 1997 measure up to 
Patten's standard? After the June 4 incident, Deng Xiaoping 
raised a lot of expectations when he said that he would "get 
several practical things done." Yet no documents have ever been 
issued regarding the "practical issue." Have they really 
materialized? Patten makes endless allusions to what is good 
about the Hong Kong system and what is bad about the Chinese 
system, one obvious example being the way the two governments 
level with the people. Even more striking is the open dialogue 
and debate that took place in an atmosphere of freedom between 
Patten and the people of Hong Kong on an equal plane after the 
governor presented his second annual report (in which the 
Chinese authorities also played an active part). 
6. For the first time, Patten devoted an entire chapter to 
Sino-British relations. He spent a lot of time emphasizing the 
close ties between China and Hong Kong and the numerous 
connections between the two, including cooperation in 
administrative matters and environmental protection. In the 
future, bridges of the concrete and steel variety will be built 
to link the two together. Even more important will be bridges of 
the invisible type. Sino-Hong Kong relations mean China learning 
from Hong Kong's value system and success story and Hong Kong 
drawing support form China's strengths. Patten said, "When many 
places in the world identify with Hong Kong's value system and 
seek to duplicate its success story, would the world become a 
better place, a more prosperous place? Or will it become less 
prosperous? We all know the answers to these questions." 
(Section 182) Patten took the initiative to define the relations 
between China and Hong Kong, giving substance to their contacts 
as well as clarifying the nature of such relations. Hong Kong 
represents progress and as such should be imitated; China 
represents power and should therefore be a source of support for 
Hong Kong to tap into. Together they can take bold strides into 
the next century. 
</P>
<P>
China has always looked at Hong Kong unilaterally from top 
to 
bottom, demanding that it fall in line with China and not the 
other way round. The kind of Sino-Hong Kong relations China 
wants is one in which Hong Kong complies with all China's orders 
and satisfies every Chinese demand. Whatever the merits of the 
case, no matter who represents progress and who represents 
backwardness, the Chinese want Hong Kong to simply blend itself 
into the entity known as China. As for making the Hong Kong 
system "living, automatic, and autonomous," the relations 
between China and the special entity of Hong Kong, how the two 
should be integrated and to what extent, as well as the costs 
and benefits of such integration... none of that has been 
considered at length. Nor do the Chinese allow such 
consideration; mention differences between the two systems and 
they cry "abetting," "sowing discord," "setting one party 
against another." A major incompatibility in Sino-Hong Kong 
relations is that the sovereign body, namely China, is large but 
backward, whereas Hong Kong, which has no sovereignty, is small 
but advanced. A unilateral emphasis on China's sovereignty would 
result in integration of a regressive type, meaning that an 
advanced Hong Kong would have to reach down to accommodate a 
backward China. A one-sided emphasis on Hong Kong's 
non-sovereign status is both impossible and disastrous. How to 
define Sino-Hong Kong relations down to the details is a major 
challenge facing Hong Kong in the future. The success or failure 
of this relationship will impact the relations between the 
mainland and Taiwan and those between the central government on 
the mainland and the localities (a perennial problem in Chinese 
politics going back thousands of years). 
7. In his annual report to the Legislative Council, Patten 
noted subtly and not so subtly that where Hong Kong was free to 
make up its mind, things had gone well in the past year, but 
where consultation with China was necessary, nothing seemed to 
have worked well. In Section 172, he said. "...outstanding 
achievements have been scored on all fronts during the past 
year...with one lone exception," which was Hong Kong's effort to 
"further its understanding with China" and "replace unproductive 
speculation with sincere trust." (Section 173) Why? "Not because 
of a lack of effort, a lack of determination to improve 
bilateral relations on Hong Kong's part." (Section 174) "The 
reason is that we still have not been able to convince Chinese 
officials that Hong Kong citizens' expectations about the 
development of their political system are in no way excessive 
but are reasonable and should be met, that they form part of the 
natural evolution of a society as it matures and becomes more 
sophisticated. In a certain sense, political development is also 
a prerequisite for Hong Kong's remaining a leading player in 
international trade. These expectations do not constitute a 
threat to China now and will not do so in the future. The fact 
of the matter is that these expectations can be met within the 
framework of "one nation, two systems." (Section 175) Instead of 
saying the Chinese refused to go along or disagreed, Patten said 
euphemistically that they (meaning himself and his associates) 
had failed to convince Chinese officials. In fact his meaning is 
very clear. We all know what the problem is: The failure by the 
Chinese authorities to see what Patten and others have been able 
to see. Cases in point: Pier No. 9, the airport, the harbor, the 
Sino-British liaison group. Patten covered all these problems at 
great length and, in so doing, seemed to have put the ball back 
in China's court. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Chinese tried to shoot down Patten's political 
reform plan in an overbearing way by resorting to economic 
pressure, ready and willing to destroy all three parties. What 
the Chinese wanted to prove was that Patten would not be able to 
accomplish a thing without China's cooperation, that he would 
end up with not just one broken leg, but two broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
Basically the Chinese have achieved this goal. On the other 
hand, the Chinese were also taking a risk. The people of Hong 
Kong might blame the Chinese Government for the delay in solving 
all those problems that need to be tackled urgently. What are 
the Chinese going to do about these feelings? How to point the 
accusing finger back at the British? How to undo the damage the 
delay has caused Hong Kong and China (particularly Guangdong)? 
</P>
<P>
Who should be held politically accountable? In the second half 
of the year, will the Chinese continue to relax their economic 
austerity drive or will they tighten the belt again? [passage

["Separate exclusive interviews" with Lu Ping, director of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of 
the PRC, by unidentified Television Broadcasts Limited reporter 
and with Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television 
Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam; places and dates not 
given; from the "Lu Ping and Chris Patten" special program-Lu 
Ping and unidentified reporter speak in Mandarin; Chris Patten 
and Lam speak in English] 
[Begin recording] [Lu] We feel that the British 
Hong Kong Government has closed the door on contact with the 
Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] too tight. We feel there is no 
need to do so. Therefore, under such circumstances, I, as vice 
chairman of the PWC, and the Governor of Hong Kong, who should 
be considered the head of Hong Kong's civil service, since he 
does not allow contacts between civil servants and the PWC, what 
is the basis for me, a member of the PWC, to have contacts with 
him? [sentence as heard] 
[Patten] I must say that like the overwhelming majority of 
people in Hong Kong, like a number of members of the PWC, I 
think it is a great pity that we are, as it were, communicating 
through television, rather than sitting down at the table 
talking to one another. [end recording] 
[Anchorman Yuan Chi-wei] Good evening. Lu Ping, director of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese State 
Council, has been visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of 
secretary general and vice chairman of the PWC. Though Hong 
Kong Governor Chris Patten said time and again that he is 
willing to meet Lu Ping at any time, Lu Ping has consistently 
refused to meet him. However, Director Lu Ping and Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten granted separate exclusive interviews to 
the Information Department of Hong Kong Television Broadcasts 
Limited and expressed their opinions on some issues in dispute 
between China and Britain. Lu Ping reiterated that one of the 
main reasons why he refused to meet Chris Patten is that the 
British side barred civil servants from meeting the PWC. But 
Patten responded by saying: 
[Begin recording] [Patten] I repeat we are not against 
giving information to the PWC. But the PWC is China's creation, 
China's appointment. The Joint Liaison Group is the result of 
an agreement enshrined in a treaty between Britain and China, 
which is supposed to be working in the interests of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Why seek to replicate that if that is the purpose? What we 
want to do is to ensure that China and Britain work in that 
cooperative spirit which the Joint Declaration commits us to. 
[Lu] We have an old saying in China, which goes: "Listen to 
his words and watch his deeds." You should take some action to 
prove that you are truly willing to cooperate with the Chinese 
side in solving these problems. Only when this happens can we 
have a basis for talks. That is why we now suggest establishing 
some contacts through various other channels. 
[Patten] Here we are in a position in which we have got 
agreed channels between Hong Kong and China and Britain, agreed 
channels which, alas, have not been working terribly well. 
</P>
<P>
People in Hong Kong, I think, scratch their heads about why it 
is that after all these months, years we have not got an airport 
agreement, why we are not making more progress on things like 
the localization and adaptation of laws, why we have not got an 
agreement on the container terminal, and so on. And I think it 
is imperative that we get the existing channels to work. I am 
not against giving information to the PWC. We give information 
to all sorts of groups. 
[Lu] Initially, our economic subgroup made an appointment 
with the president of the Kowloon-Canton Railway [KCR] to tell 
us something about the company's development strategy. The main 
reason we wanted to know its development strategy is to find out 
how it can dovetail with the mainland railway development 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
As far as we know, the existing railway planning in Hong 
Kong 
does not reflect consideration on how to connect with the 
mainland railway system. They have a plan for stretching into 
the territory of Shenzhen via Huanggang; but this will not work, 
because according to Shenzhen's plan, Huanggang will become an 
urban center of Shenzhen, which cannot possibly have a railway 
cutting across it. In such a situation, the two sides should 
coordinate and cooperate with each other. This is the very 
reason we invited the KCR president to explain this matter. 
</P>
<P>
First, he agreed to come and the time and place were also 
fixed. But just now we were told he was not coming. The KCR 
president is not a civil servant; he cannot be counted as a 
civil servant. If someone in the capacity of the Kowloon-Canton 
Railway Corporation president is unwilling to have contacts with 
us, how can you convince us that the British side is willing to 
cooperate with the Chinese side in other fields? 
[Patten] If Director Lu Ping had wanted to talk about 
infrastructure, I would have been delighted to do so. We will 
shortly want to talk to the Chinese authorities about the 
outcome of our railway development strategy, which is absolutely 
vital to the communication links of Hong Kong in the future. I 
am bound to say that the first I heard about a meeting with the 
head of the KCR was when I heard what Director Lu Ping had said, 
but I do not know any more details about the alleged KCR meeting. 
[Lu] As I said, the Hong Kong Government's attitude toward 
the PWC is not exactly one of friendliness. We once invited 
officials of the Hong Kong Government to the PWC to explain to 
us the draft regulations of the Airport Authority that they had 
put forward. The main purpose of our invitation was that the 
PWC wished to help bring the airport talks to an early start and 
to an early agreement by discussing the draft regulations of the 
Airport Authority. But after we read the regulations, we were 
not quite clear about some of them, about why they were written 
in certain ways, so we wished that the Hong Kong side could 
explain to us. The main purpose was to promote the airport 
talks. Very unfortunately, however, the Hong Kong side barred 
its civil servants from having contacts with us at the PWC. 
[Patten] Because at the moment, we put enough burdens on 
the civil service, trying to get, for example, the existing 
channels to work better. Civil servants also have to report to 
Legco [Legislative Council], which is the body that represents 
the people of Hong Kong. 
[Lu] As you know, to reach an agreement on any issue, the 
mutual understanding and accommodation that you mentioned is 
necessary. Mutual understanding and accommodation means both of 
us give in a bit, after which our two sides can reach an 
agreement. It will not work if only one side, one-way traffic 
[preceding three words in English] is relied on. We have made 
concessions on many issues. For example, on the financing 
arrangements for the airport, we have made big concessions. 
[end recording] 
[Yuan] Lu Ping kept saying that because the present 
atmosphere is not good, it is not the right time to meet Chris 
Patten. But Patten said that if the atmosphere is not good, the 
best thing to do is to sit down and talk, so as to improve the 
atmosphere. But Lu Ping said one should be more realistic. 
[Begin recording] [Lu] If we talk, we should talk in a 
cooperative atmosphere in accordance with the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the New Airport. The purpose of my meeting 
with the Governor of Hong Kong would mainly be to talk about how 
to achieve a smooth transition. This requires a cooperative 
atmosphere and a basis on which our talks can yield some 
results. If our talks cannot bring any results, I do not think 
we should waste our time. If the two of us talk for a long time 
and then meet you when we come out, you will ask us if we got 
anywhere after the long talk, and we will say we got nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
This will be a big disappointment for the people of Hong Kong. 
[Patten] He talked to you in the week about the atmosphere 
not being conducive to a meeting. If you do not have a good 
atmosphere, the best thing to do is to have a meeting to try to 
make the atmosphere better. I am absolutely sure that the 
overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong who want us to meet 
and want us to talk these things through in a sensible and 
reasonable way will in due course have their ambitions met, 
because if we are serious about cooperation and the interests of 
Hong Kong, then we have got at some stage to sit round the table 
and then work things out together. 
[Lu] I think we should be more realistic and the two sides 
should create a better atmosphere. As far as we are concerned, 
the invitations we extended to the Hong Kong Government still 
stand. The PWC's door is always open. The question now is 
whether or not the Hong Kong Government is willing to open this 
door. 
[Patten] It is a body appointed by Chinese officials to 
advise Chinese officials. Unlike the Joint Liaison Group, it is 
not a result of an agreement between two sovereign powers, 
similarly the Land Commission, similarly the Airport Committee. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike the Legislative Council, it is not a body which 
represents public opinion right across the board in Hong Kong. 
[end recording] 
[Yuan] Coming up next is the second part of this program on 
how Lu Ping and Chris Patten look at the Xi Yang incident and 
whether or not the two of them will have a chance to meet each 
other in the future. Stay with us. [at this point program goes 
to commercial break] 
During our interviews with them, both Lu Ping and Chris 
Patten were asked about the Xi Yang incident. Our reporter 
asked Lu Ping a question about the Xi Yang incident causing the 
people of Hong Kong to worry about the freedom of the press. 
[Begin recording] [Lu] This is not the case. It has 
nothing to do with Hong Kong's freedom of the press whatsoever, 
because Xi Yang committed the crime within the territory of 
China. Since his crime was committed within China's territory, 
it of course was handled according to China's law. China's law 
is of course not entirely the same as Hong Kong's law. Perhaps, 
if he had committed the crime in Hong Kong, it could have been 
handled differently. But he committed the crime in China's 
territory. No matter who you are, you must observe China's law 
when you are on the land of China. It does not apply to Hong 
Kong people only. If a U.S. citizen commits a crime in China's 
territory, it will also be handled according to China's law. 
</P>
<P>
This is perfectly justified. So it has nothing to do with Hong 
Kong's freedom of the press at all. It would have been the same 
problem if it had been a U.S. reporter or a British reporter. 
[Patten] We are not seeking to interfere with somebody 
else's judicial system, not a bit of it. But there was genuine 
surprise in Hong Kong at a sentence handed out to somebody who 
worked for a Hong Kong newspaper for a story which apparently 
appeared on the front page of another Peking-supported newspaper 
in Hong Kong on the same day. And there was great surprise at 
the severity of the sentence for disclosing economic 
information, exactly the sort of thing which helps the Hong Kong 
stock market to spin round day after day. But what we have 
concentrated on is not any of that. What we concentrated on is 
a simple issue: It is very important that journalists in Hong 
Kong know precisely the rules and regulations which they have to 
keep to if they are going to operate reasonably in China; and 
what we do not want is the impression to be created that in 
order, perhaps, to get Hong Kong journalists to write things 
that they perhaps do not really feel or to censor themselves, 
exemplary sentences are going to be handed out, for reasons 
which people cannot understand. 
[Unidentified reporter] Today, many people in Hong Kong are 
requesting a special amnesty from the Chinese Government for Xi 
Yang. Is such an amnesty possible? 
[Lu] This is not within my authority. As far as I know, 
there is no provision on special amnesty in China's 
Constitution. No, there is none. 
[Patten] I am surprised that senior Chinese officials do not 
understand why this case has caused so much concern in Hong 
Kong. Not just a minority that have been worried about it, nor 
just a minority who have been worried about other things that 
have happened in China. It goes across the community. 
[Lam] Governor, what is your government willing to do to 
safeguard press freedom; for example, the freedom to 
information. And the demand from legislators like Christine Loh, 
do you go for that? 
[Patten] Well, what we are doing at the moment is looking at 
the suggestions in Christine Loh's bill. We will be responding 
to that very soon and we are also committed to reviewing our 
existing legislation to remove from it provisions which may be 
used by others to abuse press freedom. 
[Reporter] Some Hong Kong reporters cannot go to Qiandao Hu 
to cover the incident. Is there any explanation? 
[Lu] As to this issue, I personally feel that it does not 
seem necessary for Hong Kong reporters to boycott news gathering 
in China. I do not see it as necessary. What is the point? 
</P>
<P>
They are two different things. Why do you have to boycott news 
gathering in China? 
[Reporter] China rejected their request to cover news in 
China. Was it a retaliatory gesture? 
[Lu] It is not an issue of retaliation. It is common sense 
that since you have boycotted gathering news in China, why do 
you still want to come? It is okay if you send other reporters 
in. You boycotted, so let someone else take your place. We 
still welcome them to cover news. 
[Reporter] In that case.... 
[Lu] You do not have to come yourself, do you? 
[Reporter] Does it mean that those who once said they would 
boycott news gathering in China will be permanently barred from 
entering the mainland to cover news? 
[Lu] No, no. Doesn't your boycott also have a timetable? 
</P>
<P>
To the end of May, I heard? I do not know. I am not quite 
sure. Is it true that the boycott will continue to the end of 
May? Isn't there a deadline, reporters? [end recording] 
[Yuan] The biggest issue in dispute between China and 
Britain now is Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's constitutional 
reform proposals. Our reporter asked Lu Ping if the Legislative 
Council amends the proposals so that they are in line with the 
Basic Law, will they be acceptable? 
[Begin recording] [Lu] This is absolutely impossible, 
because there is already an understanding between the two sides 
on how the first government should be formed, that is, the 
Chinese side and the British side should reach an agreement 
through diplomatic channels. No agreement can be reached 
between China and Britain unless it is through diplomatic 
channels. This is not for the Legislative Council to decide. 
</P>
<P>
It is not for the Legislative Council to lead the Chinese side 
and the British side by the nose. To say the least, the Chinese 
side will not accept being led by the nose by the Hong Kong 
Legislative Council. Therefore, the Chinese side will not 
acknowledge any decision adopted by the Legislative Council. 
</P>
<P>
This is certain. 
[Reporter] These days, we in Hong Kong are getting a clear 
message that the three-tier councils must be disbanded and 
reorganized in 1997. But why is the Chinese side so firm on 
this issue and why is this attitude made known even before the 
Hong Kong Legislative Council passes any election proposal? 
[Lu] We did not make known this attitude just now. 
[Reporter] But now.... 
[Lu] After the British side shut the door tight on the 
arrangements for 1994-95 elections and refused carry on with the 
talks with us, we declared our attitude then. This is not a new 
issue. As you should know, in 1997, the kind of change that 
will take place here is not like what happens when the British 
Conservative Party steps down and the Labor Party goes into 
power. It will be a shift from one government to another. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, under such circumstances, it stands to reason that a 
new government, new legislature, and new judicial body will be 
formed. This is only normal. We adopted the "through train" 
arrangement because it is a special measure. Strictly speaking, 
everything should start anew and setting up a separate kitchen 
should apply to everything. But for the sake of smooth 
transition, we adopted this special measure, namely, the 
"through train" option. Yet this requires a basis, which is the 
British side's cooperation with us and convergence of the 
composition of the last Legislative Council with the provisions 
of the Basic Law. 
[Patten] Well, there are some things which are in their 
sovereign power which I do not deny at all, though of course I 
would hope they would operate within the terms of their 
international treaty obligations as well: In this case, the 
Joint Declaration. But they can do all sorts of things after 
1997 if they want. What they have to ask themselves is whether 
those things are in the interests of Hong Kong and whether those 
things will help to secure the hearts and minds of the people of 
Hong Kong. 
[Reporter] Recently, a number of recommendations raised at 
the discussions of the PWC have caused much controversy among 
the people of Hong Kong. The first recommendation is that civil 
servants should make it clear whether or not they want to stay 
in their positions beyond 1997. The more recent one is the 
extension of the operation of the land fund. Do these two 
recommendations indicate that those at the PWC or its members do 
not have a good idea of Hong Kong's reality or the agreements 
previously reached between China and Britain? 
[Lu] No. This is a sheer misunderstanding. It does not 
mean that the PWC members do not have a good idea of Hong Kong's 
conditions. As far as I know, they did not put it that way and 
the PWC did not discuss it like that. But how did the question 
come up? Well, Cheng Yu-sho conducted a survey, a poll, didn't 
he? The results claimed that by 1997, many civil servants, 
especially senior civil servants and administrative officers, 
will resign. So we said if it is true that so many 
administrative officers will quit, there will be many things 
unattended to. What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Cheng Yu-sho's survey was not comprehensive and his 
results were impossible. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, it was suggested that if a civil servant is 
not willing to go on to work in the Special Administrative 
Region [SAR] Government in 1997, he should notify the 
Preparatory Committee or other authorities beforehand. He 
should do it himself, making it clear that he is not going to 
carry on beyond 1997. This way, the chief executive or other 
chief officials can look for someone at an early stage to 
succeed him, so that the government's operation will not be 
affected or come to a stop. This is how we put it and how we 
discussed it. I do not know why stories came out in the 
newspapers later, claiming that they were asked to declare their 
so-called political stand. I feel this is a pure 
misunderstanding. We did not mean it at all. 
</P>
<P>
If you.... [Lu pauses] I believe by 1997, the overwhelming 
majority, 90 percent, of the civil servants will be happy to 
carry on in the Special Administrative Region Government. Only 
a small proportion of them may, when the time comes, wish to 
leave the government. We hope these people will notify us two 
or three months in advance, as required by regulations. 
</P>
<P>
As to the issue of the land fund, I feel this is also a pure 
misunderstanding. At the subgroup discussion of the PWC, we 
made it very clear that the reason we discussed the issue of the 
land fund is that we hope on 1 July 1997, without a day's delay, 
we can hand the land fund of over 100 billion [no currency 
specified as heard], or something like that, to the SAR 
Government in one lump sum without retaining a cent. But the 
question is which organization the land fund should go to. We 
discussed whether it should be the Foreign Exchange Fund or the 
Hong Kong Government's Financial Department. No matter what, 
the land fund will certainly be handed to the Special 
Administrative Region Government. If the Special Administrative 
Region Government, for a time, cannot decide how to take care of 
this fund, it may temporarily retain the structure of the 
existing commission for managing the land fund. This is why I 
said it was a pure misunderstanding. [end recording] 
[Yuan] The Sino-British row has continued to this day 
without showing any signs of improvement. When will Lu Ping 
come again? Has Chris Patten considered the possibility of the 
British side extending a formal invitation to Lu Ping? 
[Begin recording] [Patten] Well, that is something we will 
have to look at, whether or not it is sensible to make another 
formal suggestion to Director Lu. I think he knows perfectly 
well that as far as we are concerned, whenever he would like a 
meeting, we would be very happy to have one. 
[Lu] Now we do not have the basis. First, you must go 
through these channels, including the channel of the PWC, and 
the two sides start communication and create some prospect of a 
solution through negotiation. Then the two of us can have a 
talk on the basis of this and this is the only way we can 
possibly work out some solution. If we go ahead and meet each 
other while nothing has settled into shape, it will be all 
empty. The two of us cannot possibly discuss many detailed 
issues. Only when the detailed issues have been solved at the 
more preliminary levels can we expect some solution from our 
meeting. 
[Patten] I very much hope that Director Lu will have had a 
very good week in Hong Kong, will have seen what progress we 
have made in the last couple of years since he has been able to 
be here, will have seen that despite what was said at the recent 
PWC meeting, there is not much sign of social turmoil here in 
Hong Kong. I hope he will have had an enjoyable stay and I hope 
it will have encouraged him to come back many times before 30 
June 1997. We would very much like to see him and I hope that 
each time he comes, he will be able to broaden the number of 
people that he actually sees and communicates with.

FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (1):  On course for the transfer - Hong
Kong is thriving as it prepares for reversion to Chinese sovereignty in
1997. Business confidence has returned, tourism has revived and a huge
airport project is under construction.  Simon Holberton examines the mood in
the colony awaiting the arrival of a new governor in July
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's newly-appointed governor, arrives in the
colony in July he will find that, five years away from its reversion to
Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong is thriving. Just a year ago the colony was
in the doldrums: a bitter fight with China over colonial government's plans
to build a huge airport was under way; the Gulf War had depressed tourist
arrivals; and the colony's first partially democratic elections were
looming.
</P>
<P>
Yet, in a way which underlines the skittish, manic depressive nature of the
place, business confidence is now at it highest level for three years. The
'airport problem' was solved with Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister,
going to Beijing last September to sign the deal; tourism has picked up;
and, more importantly, southern China's economic expansion, which continues
at an exceptional pace, has come to dominate local business sentiment.
</P>
<P>
In one year share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange have risen by
nearly 40 per cent; so, too, have property prices. These singular rises in
asset prices - aided, to be sure, by a lax monetary policy  - underline the
brimming optimism of Hong Kong. The colony expects to grow by more than 5
per cent in real terms this year, after a 4 per cent real expansion in 1991,
and nearly 3 per cent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
To judge by the stock market, property prices, and bilateral trade with and
investment in China, Hong Kong appears to have come to terms with its future
ruler. The economic integration of Hong Kong with China is, considering that
it has occurred just over the past 10 years, nothing short of astonishing.
</P>
<P>
This integration is most visible in the way Hong Kong's trade has changed
over the past six years. During that time Hong Kong has reverted to a role
it occupied before the Second World War: that of entrepot for China's trade
with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong exported goods with a value of HKDollars 765.8bn; of
these HKDollars 534.8 were 're-exports', more than 80 per cent of which
related to trade with China. But for the re-export trade, Hong Kong would
have a visible trade deficit with the rest of the world because it is
becoming more of a service area and transferring some of its manufacturing
to south China.
</P>
<P>
The change in trade flows has had a corresponding impact on the colony's
economy. Manufacturing's share of gross domestic product and employment has
fallen, while the service sector - trade processing, communications,
shipping - has grown.
</P>
<P>
This change in Hong Kong's economy could not have happened without the
historic change of course China embarked upon in 1979. Deng Xiaoping,
China's paramount leader, opened the country's door and Hong Kong's
entrepreneurs rushed in.
</P>
<P>
Today, Hong Kong's factory owners in Guangdong - the Chinese province
bordering the colony - employ between 2m and 3m workers; Hong Kong supplies
China with an estimated 40 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings by
virtue of Chinese goods flowing through the colony, earnings of mainland
companies in the colony and remittances by local people to families still in
China; and, Hong Kong is the source of 60 per cent of foreign investment in
China.
</P>
<P>
Yet, in spite of the extraordinary economic integration that has taken place
over the past decade, China, at a political level, divides Hong Kong society
and politics. Come June 30, 1997, Hong Kong will be welcomed back into the
bosom of a country which, at best, nurtures ancient attitudes to civil and
political rights, and which for millennia has been ruled by an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
Although the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future which Britain and China
signed in September 1984 and the Basic Law which the Chinese parliament
passed in April 1991 provide for the maintenance of Hong Kong's way of life
and a 'high degree of autonomy', the colony's citizens have continued to
vote with their feet, seeking the protection of foreign lands and the
passports they offer.
</P>
<P>
There have been cases of Hong Kong Chinese returning to the colony but this
is hardly surprising given that their most popular destinations - Canada,
the US and Australia - have all been suffering economic downturns. Bored and
under-employed they have returned with their insurance policy - their
passport  - tightly gripped.
</P>
<P>
They have come back to a growing economy and to a place where last
September's elections for the Legislative Council have changed the political
landscape. Politics is no longer conducted in clubs but now in full public
view. The government, in the past rarely held accountable for its decisions,
now finds it has to make a case for its policies, from bus fares to
taxation. It faces a continual barrage of complaints from elected
representatives and pressure groups.
</P>
<P>
The government finds itself caught between forces pulling in opposite
directions. On the one hand there is a group of local,
democratically-elected politicians who implicitly challenge the colonial
government's legitimacy. They, having been elected, claim a right to have
their policies taken seriously and adopted.
</P>
<P>
On the other, in a curious reversal of fortune, is Beijing. It is keen that
the government retains its position of dominance - because it wants the
post-1997 government to inherit that dominance - and snarls each time the
colonial regime appears to accede to local demands.
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in the middle is a group of largely appointed politicians,
generally of the conservative stripe, some of whom sit in the legislature
and on the governor's Executive Council, or cabinet. They wish to retain
Hong Kong's free-wheeling capitalist system, are suspicious of their elected
brethren whom, they claim with some justice, wish to spend the colony's
wealth before it is earned. This group also seeks a non-confrontational
policy towards China, believing that it is better to work with the future
ruler than to antagonise it.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten will have to chart his course carefully. Broadening political
representation in his cabinet is one not entirely risk-free way, but is an
option which if skilfully handled could repay handsome domestic dividends.
</P>
<P>
If successful it could take a lot of the rancour out of domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
In drawing the sting, however, from the domestic body politic he risks
inserting it into the tender hide of China. Beijing has already begun to
agitate on electoral reform; Mr Patten can expect more.
</P>
<P>
Beijing wants an extra seat in the 1995 legislature for its Hong Kong
business association, via one of the nine new 'functional constituencies' -
'rotten boroughs' by another name. This may prove a useful bargaining chip
for him to cash in, in the ensuing contest over electoral reform.
</P>
<P>
Yet Mr Patten's main task is to preside over the peaceful transfer of Hong
Kong to China in 1997. His key point of contact on the Chinese side will be
Mr Zhou Nan, the head of Beijing's unofficial embassy in the colony. A man
neither popular with his staff nor with the people of Hong Kong, Mr Zhou has
proved difficult for the British to deal with since his appointment after
the Tiananmen massacre of June 1989.
</P>
<P>
In the absence, however, of a replacement to match the new governor's
seniority, Mr Patten will have to deal with him as best he can. He will also
have to deal with Mr Lu Ping, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office
of the State Council, and China's most senior official in charge of
day-to-day Hong Kong Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten, with help from London, will have to give a kick-start to
proceedings within the Joint Liaison Group - the Anglo-Chinese forum in
which issues regarding the transition are decided. Although much was
achieved by the outgoing governor Lord Wilson, the list of what needs to be
done is daunting. Mr Patten will have to marshal all his considerable
political skills to achieve a breakthrough.

FT  26 OCT 92 / Patten raises stakes over Hong Kong's future: An
unprecedented contest is looming
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE SHARP deterioration in relations between Britain and China over Hong
Kong's political future has cast a pall over the colony's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The territory's stock market opened this morning sharply lower. After half
an hour of trading the Hang Seng index was hovering just above 6,000, down
more than 245 points, continuing Friday's weaker trend. Analysts had
expected a decline in the market, which had recently risen strongly in
response to the economic policies announced by China's communist leaders.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the UK and China have deteriorated markedly since Mr
Patten, with the general support of the Hong Kong people, announced
proposals on October 7 for elections in 1994 and 1995 which would allow for
greater, though still limited, democracy in choosing local leaders.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the governor has repeatedly held out the possibility that he
will proceed with his plans even in the face of opposition from China -
marking a change in British policy towards Hong Kong and China. In the past
London has placed a priority on reaching agreement with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Such a head-to-head contest between Beijing and Britain's governor in Hong
Kong would be without precedent in the colony. It would require from the
people of Hong Kong a defiance of Beijing which many of their business and
political leaders have been reluctant to make for fear of damaging their
interests.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten presented his plans to officials in Beijing on a three-day visit
last week and told them he needed a decision by the end of the year. His
proposals were flatly rejected.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, said Beijing
would challenge the validity of future elections and abrogate agreements to
build the colony's multi-billion dollar airport if Mr Patten proceeded
without China's agreement.
</P>
<P>
The airport and its associated infrastructure projects have been a running
sore in Anglo-Chinese relations since the project was announced, in the
aftermath of the June 1989 uprising in Beijing, as a confidence boosting
measure for the colony. Agreement to proceed with the HKDollars 163.5bn
project was only reached a year ago when Mr John Major, Britain's prime
minister, visited Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Since then China has found fault with two alternative financing proposals
put to it by the Hong Kong government. It claims that both are not
cost-effective and would put an onerous financial burden on the post-1997
government in Hong Kong - charges which find little support in Hong Kong's
financial community.
</P>
<P>
The government had already let 17 contracts worth HKDollars 19bn - HKDollars
3bn under budget. Mr Patten has said the government would do its best to
complete the project in the absence of the Chinese government's approval.
</P>
<P>
But Lu's threat, calculated to scare the international financial community,
could make it difficult for the government to raise external finance to fund
the project.
</P>
<P>
Lu held out little hope of agreement on either constitutional or airport
related matters. He claimed the governor's plans violated the 1984
Anglo-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and the Basic Law, which will
act as Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. He also asserted Mr Patten's
plans ignored assurances given by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign
secretary, to Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, on the conduct of the
1995 polls.
</P>
<P>
In a robust performance before a special session of the Legislative Council
(LegCo) on Saturday, Mr Patten reissued his challenge to Beijing to respond
with constructive alternatives to proposals he made on October 7 for the
colony's political development.
</P>
<P>
The governor said he was prepared to discuss these alternatives with China
but reminded legislators that any alternatives had to be fair, open and
command the support of the people of Hong Kong. They also had to be agreed
soon as legislation would have to be placed before LegCo early in the New
Year.
</P>
<P>
During the special sitting of LegCo, Mr Patten proposals were endorsed by
liberal politicians and some independents. Conservative politicians did not
declare their position. Some of the colony's newspapers also expressed
concern about China's reaction to the governor's proposals.
</P>
<P>
With an eye on these legislators, the governor reminded all members of LegCo
that it is they who will have to pass any legislation drawn up to provide
for the forthcoming elections. 'We should all be clear on where we stand,'
he said. 'Nothing can absolve members of this council from taking a view on
the future political development of Hong Kong.'
The proposals, which Mr Patten believes are consistent with Anglo-Chinese
agreements and Chinese law, provide for a greater, though still restricted,
application of democracy in the conduct of future elections.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten denied that the UK had given China the undertakings Lu claimed. He
said he had no objection to letters from Mr Hurd and Qian being made public.
</P>
<P>
That decision, however, is not his.
</P>
<P>
The government is bracing itself for a further onslaught on Mr Patten's
plans from the colony's pro-Beijing press. Designed to undermine his public
support, these newspapers published more than 70 attacks on him and his
plans in the lead up to his visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
As China's attitude to the airport shows, it is prepared to sacrifice the
economic well-being of its people in response to a perceived threat to its
political authority.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten, says his aides, knows this and does not plan to stand still.
</P>
<P>
According to aides, the governor believes he can carry the legislature; in
the event of failure to find agreement with China, they promise a publicity
campaign of the sort which prepared the colony for his policy speech. 'We
will not be neutral,' said one.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten has said, however, that what he finally proposes has to be
'acceptable to the people of Hong Kong'. This condition allows him to change
his policies in line with his reading of public opinion and the reality in
LegCo. As another of his aides, speaking of the choices the Hong Kong people
now face, noted: 'It is their community after all.'

<TEXT>
<P>
MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday gave China until the end of
the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or
to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
After more than six hours of discussions with Lu Ping, director of the
Chinese cabinet's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, Mr Patten said: 'I
cannot say we reached a meeting of minds on what I put forward.'
He also indicated that they achieved little progress in settling the impasse
over the financing of Hong Kong's new airport project. Mr Patten said that
they had agreed the best forum for settlement was the Airport Committee of
the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group - a place where consensus has been
stalled for months.
</P>
<P>
This is Mr Patten's first visit to China as governor of Hong Kong. He leaves
for the colony tomorrow after discussions today with Chinese trade
officials.
</P>
<P>
It emerged last night that Li Peng, China's prime minister, had refused to
see him. Instead he will meet Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
On October 7, Mr Patten presented plans for the conduct of the colony's 1994
local and 1995 legislative elections which provide for much greater
democracy than has previously been the case in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In considering alternatives to these plans, the governor said he was guided
by three principles. They should be 'fair', 'open and honest', and
'acceptable to the people of Hong Kong', he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten said that he was prepared to meet Lu 'at any time and in any
place' to reach agreement but had reminded the Chinese they had only until
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said the legislative timetable demanded that bills be put before the
Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's unicameral legislature, early in
the new year to give effect to the planned changes for the 1994 and 1995
elections.
</P>
<P>
Although Mr Patten did not say so yesterday, he has suggested in the past
that he would be prepared to introduce his proposals for a slightly faster
pace of democratic development in Hong Kong without China's approval.
</P>
<P>
He went out of his way, however, to praise Lu - the man who holds day-to-day
responsibility for ensuring a smooth transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong
in 1997. He lauded the manner in which Lu put forward China's position but
was less than pleased with what he had to say.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten would give only few details of Lu's response to his proposals. He
said that Lu pointed out the existence of the Basic Law - the
Beijing-drafted constitution for Hong Kong post-1997. (This has become
Chinese code for 'no change'.)
'I am bound to say I don't think this answers some of the problems I have to
disentangle before the end of this year,' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
His visit has been preceded by a barrage of criticism of himself and his
proposals, in the pro-Beijing Hong Kong press, not seen since the Cultural
Revolution of the 1960s and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten's defeat in the British parliamentary election earlier this year
has been used to suggest he is a failed politician.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued
administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial
agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was immediately rejected by the Hong Kong government, which
accused China of violating Anglo-Chinese agreements and its own law for Hong
Kong which comes into force after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty
in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office was seen in the
colony as an attempt by China to undermine confidence in Hong Kong's economy
and to defeat proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, for more
democratic elections due in 1995. It represents a serious escalation in the
row which Beijing has linked to London's change in policy towards Hong
Kong's democratic development. Analysts in Hong Kong said it also amounted
to a bid by China for greater involvement in the colony's administration.
</P>
<P>
'They want to bring the government to its knees, if they can,' a senior Hong
Kong government official said last night.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese government, in a
dispatch released through the Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, said that all
contracts, leases and agreements signed and ratified by the Hong Kong
government would be invalid after June 30 1997 unless they were first
approved by China.
</P>
<P>
It added, however, that China encouraged foreign investment in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In London, the Foreign Office rejected Beijing's threat, saying it was
contrary to the 1990 Basic Law for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a British climbdown on democracy, or the defeat of Mr
Patten's proposals on the floor of the local legislature, China's escalating
attacks could undermine some large-scale business ventures in energy,
communications and trade which are planned for Hong Kong in addition to the
colony's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 15bn) airport project.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's financial and business community was last night deeply concerned
about the growing rift between London and Beijing and is expected to voice
louder calls for Mr Patten to retreat. Liberal politicians said China's
behaviour underlined the need for democracy to protect Hong Kong from the
arbitrary exercise of power by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
British and US businesses with interests in Hong Kong were more sanguine
about prospects for the colony, indicating that Beijing's threat would have
no impact on investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
Share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange fell nearly 3 per cent in
trading yesterday, although this was largely in response to comments by a
senior Chinese official late last week over the validity of the award of
land to a consortium to build a container terminal in Hong Kong. The warning
from Beijing yesterday came too late to affect the market.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government responded to China's latest attack by declaring
that Beijing was in breach of both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration
on Hong Kong's future and the 1990 Basic Law - the colony's post-1997
constitution - drafted by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Both documents guarantee the safety of existing contracts after the colony
reverts to Chinese sovereignty.

<P>
CHINA stepped up the war of words over the future of Hong Kong yesterday,
threatening to ignore the results of democratic elections proposed by Mr
Chris Patten, the colony's governor, once it assumes control in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also accused him of slamming the door on further talks.
</P>
<P>
Mr Lu Ping, China's senior official for Hong Kong affairs, said that if Mr
Patten pressed ahead with his democratic reforms Beijing would start a 'new
kitchen' in 1997 - a Chinese expression which means making a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
Mr Lu also added his voice to personal criticism of the governor, saying
that he would be condemned by history over his handling of the Hong Kong
issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Beijing press conference, he left the door open, however, for
further contacts with Britain, saying that China 'always stands for
co-operation, and not confrontation'.
</P>
<P>
In London, the Foreign Office stressed that it was still offering 'talks at
any time'. An official added: 'The only sensible way forward is for the two
sides to sit down and discuss without preconditions the points of difference
between us.'
The remarks by Mr Lu, head of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office,
were greeted with relief by the Hong Kong stock market, which had been
bracing itself for a more uncompromising stand.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng index was some 200 points down before Mr Lu's press
conference, but recovered most of its losses to close at 5,958.33, down 21.7
on the day.
</P>
<P>
Mr Lu said: 'We will construct a kitchen in accordance with the design in
the Basic Law. We have to do this because the kitchen started by Mr Chris
Patten before 1997 will not converge with the stipulations of the Basic Law
after 1997.'
The Basic Law is a mini-constitution for Hong Kong after 1997 which was
approved by China's parliament in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Mr Lu said China would have to make preparations ahead of 1997 for the
cancellation of Mr Patten's proposed democratic reforms; but he stopped
short of saying China would set up an alternative administration in Hong
Kong before the end of British rule.
</P>
<P>
He also refrained from repeating economic threats made by China last year,
although it seems unlikely that Britain will win China's agreement to
complete Hong Kong's Dollars 175bn (Pounds 123bn) airport project, or
further develop the colony's container port.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador, regretted the
continuing personal attacks on Mr Patten. He said that decisions over Hong
Kong were 'taken by the British government as a whole'.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, Mr Patten reiterated his preparedness to hold talks with China
about his proposed 1994-95 elections. But in spite of the governor's
attempts to calm growing concerns over the row with Beijing, local
politicians were pessimistic about an early solution.

FT  03 DEC 94 / 1,000 days of uncertainty: It is China that will call the
shots on the handover of Hong Kong
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mr Philip Tose, the maverick Hong Kong financier, once offered Britain's
Tory party Pounds 5m to remove Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor. Now,
he says, it is too late to make any difference.
</P>
<P>
With the battle over electoral reform ended, and less than 1,000 days to go
before the handover on June 30 1997, the die is cast. Hong Kong has embarked
on the final leg of its journey back to Chinese rule. And most people in the
colony believe there is little Britain can do by way of new initiatives.
</P>
<P>
As the sense of change becomes palpable - with China's Citic taking the
British trading company Jardine Matheson's seat on the board of the powerful
Jockey Club, and Mandarin beginning to displace Cantonese on the government
radio - it is now up to China to decide how smooth the handover will be, and
the shape of life beyond.
</P>
<P>
Optimists suggest that Chinese officials are beginning to realise that they
need British co-operation. 'Mr Patten is the governor and the representative
of the Hong Kong British government,' says one senior Chinese official in
Hong Kong. 'We have to deal with him. On many points we don't agree with him
but he is the governor.'
Some concrete evidence of this new realism is the agreement Beijing reached
last month with Britain on the funding for Hong Kong's HKDollars 160bn
(Pounds 13bn) airport development. This has freed funds for building a
railway connecting the airport to urban Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Encouragement is also taken from reports that Mr Qian Qichen, China's
foreign minister, is considering a visit to Britain next year. And Chinese
officials in Hong Kong indicate a desire to deal with the nitty-gritty of
the transfer at a meeting of the Joint Liaison Group, a bilateral body with
Britain, this month.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong's passage from British colony to a 'special administrative
region' of China still seems likely to be dogged by controversy.
</P>
<P>
'While we are totally sincere in wanting to be co-operative and
constructive, the nature of an enterprise as complicated as this makes it
very difficult to see circumstances in which there are not going to be any
more arguments,' says Mr Patten. 'What I hope is that we will make progress
in other areas which could avoid arguments becoming too poisonous and
seeping into everything.'
The chief obstacle to a smooth transition is the possibility of an exodus of
the senior civil servants, who have managed the colony with a light and
sophisticated touch. 'The biggest problem that Hong Kong faces is the
stability and continuity of the civil service,' says Mr Allen Lee, the
leader of the pro-business Liberal party.
</P>
<P>
Mr Lee says that, 'in general, Hong Kong people are still fearful of the
Communist party'. This is especially so among senior civil servants who will
have most day-to-day contact with representatives of the new sovereign power
after 1997. Many have come into close contact with mainland officials and
been subjected to humiliating treatment.
</P>
<P>
The importance of morale among the colony's 180,000 civil servants is
acknowledged by Chinese officials. Some, with a hint of desperation in their
voices, note that only the top 20 to 30 jobs will require vetting by
Beijing. 'The ones below . . . we hope these civil servants will stay,' says
one official. 'We need them; they have made a great contribution to Hong
Kong.'
It is hard to see how Beijing's desire to maintain a tight grip on the
levers of power can be meshed with the traditional independence and
professionalism of Hong Kong's civil service.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of sovereignty is full of seemingly innocuous details that turn
out to be traps for the unwary. Take school text books, which have recently
emerged as an issue because some pro-Beijing figures in Hong Kong do not
believe that the current texts used in schools are sufficiently 'patriotic'.
</P>
<P>
'We are not suggesting any change to the curriculum,' says Mr Tsang Yok
Sing, a leading Beijing adviser in Hong Kong who is himself a school
headmaster. 'We sent a selection of textbooks to Beijing and they were
shocked . . . by references to Taiwan as the Republic of China, the People's
Republic as a neighbour, and the glossing over of Britain's role in the
Opium War.'
Text books for the 1997/98 school year have to be ordered by the end of
1996. Already some publishers have said they may withdraw from the textbook
market. Given the high status accorded to education in Chinese society this
is a potentially explosive issue for Beijing if not handled sensitively.
</P>
<P>
Equally it is unclear quite what Britain can do to ease the situation.
</P>
<P>
But it is the absence of what is known as the through train that may prove
the most debilitating factor of all. The through train encapsulated the hope
that those elected in 1995 to the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's
60-member law making body, would be able to serve their full four-year term,
regardless of the 1997 handover.
</P>
<P>
After the dispute on electoral reform, Beijing announced that it would
dismiss the 1995 LegCo once China resumed sovereignty of Hong Kong, and
replace it with a provisional legislature.
</P>
<P>
This decision is set to take Hong Kong into uncharted waters, and casts
doubt over the continuity of the colony's legal system.
</P>
<P>
The colonial government had planned to hand over by introducing a piece of
midnight legislation to eliminate all references in Hong Kong law to
institutions such as the governor and the Queen. But China says an
illegitimate 1995 LegCo cannot pass laws binding a future government.
</P>
<P>
However, the Basic Law - the China-drafted mini-constitution for post-1997
Hong Kong - does not provide for a provisional legislature as such, although
it does foresee a 'preparatory committee' to be formed in 1996 that will
determine who sits in this legislature.
</P>
<P>
Mr Tsang, a member of the Chinese government committee planning for the
handover, says the provisional legislature will have full powers to make
laws for an expected term of nine to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
'It's an extremely dangerous thing to have because they (Beijing) can clean,
with one sweep, any laws they don't like,' says Ms Anna Wu, an appointed
member of LegCo and a lawyer specialising in intellectual property law.
</P>
<P>
It seems likely that the committee to which Mr Tsang belongs, the
preliminary working committee, will become the 1996 preparatory committee.
</P>
<P>
That body may well elect from among itself the 60 members of the provisional
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Next year's elections will still matter, however. A strong showing by Hong
Kong's pro-democracy groups, led by Mr Martin Lee's Democratic party, will
be seen as a protest vote against Beijing. But a good showing by Beijing's
own supporters will create another problem: China would then have to decide
whether to accept an elected council favourable to its point of view.
</P>
<P>
Some take this prospect seriously. Mr Tsang says of the final
recommendations of the provisional legislature: 'I think it most likely that
any substantial conclusion will be deferred until after next year's
elections to see how things are.'
For Mr Patten, the cost of confronting China over the 1995 elections has
been high.
</P>
<P>
Even his supporters see him as a spent force. 'I think the governor has
become very stuck,' says Ms Wu, a Patten appointee. 'I can't see him
challenging the Chinese again over any other major issue. He will go for a
conciliatory, appeasement path,' she says, in the run up to the handover.
</P>
<P>
His critics go much further, suggesting that there is little chance of any
meaningful dialogue while Mr Patten occupies government house. 'At least one
senior Chinese official has said to me he believes there is no change of
restoring co-operation and trust unless and until we have a new governor,'
says Mr Tsang.
</P>
<P>
Mr Patten is adamant that he is not leaving Hong Kong until he has
discharged his duty. But it remains in China's gift to make Mr Patten a
player in the discussions on the transfer.
</P>
<P>
China's supporters in the colony claim that Mr Patten's policy is now to
make Hong Kong harder to govern by 'loosening the screws' before the British
leave. This is a reference to the repeal of some of the colony's more
repressive pieces of legislation, such as the power to censor films. Britain
used such ordinances to control Hong Kong but does not want to leave them on
the statute books for the incoming regime.
</P>
<P>
There is similar wariness among Chinese officials about the possibility that
Britain may lay down financial obligations which only have to be met after
1997.
</P>
<P>
Mr Zhou Nan, the most senior representative of the Chinese Communist party
and government in Hong Kong, recently attacked Mr Patten's plans for a
government-funded pension, saying: 'During the transition period, we should
not casually transplant a costly Euro-socialist pay-as-you-go concept to
Hong Kong without prudently taking into consideration similar western
programmes' long-standing track record of grossly under-estimating
liabilities and grossly over-estimating funding projections.'
Mr Patten claims that by 1997 public spending in Hong Kong as a percentage
of GDP will be lower than it was in 1982 - the year Britain began handover
negotiations with China. 'I don't think Hong Kong needs lectures on how to
run an economy or how to control public spending,' he says.
</P>
<P>
But this kind of debate is being increasingly overshadowed by the
realisation that the transition will be far from smooth.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese banker says: 'Hong Kong will become less free; more like
Singapore. There will be less freedom, but that's to be expected. The law
will become less important and personal contacts more important. There will
also be more corruption. These won't be immediate changes but will happen
over time. We will just have to get used to it.' In Mrs Wu's view: 'There is
no absolute guarantee for Hong Kong that the 1984 Sino-British joint
declaration will be met. The real issue is: how easy will it be (for China)
to break? 'One country two systems' is a political idea, not one that is
built on firm juridical foundations.'
