Both Sides Would Ban Them From Airports, But Still Can't Agree
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If this had been another issue, liberal Sen.
</P>
<P>
Howard Metzenbaum and conservative Sen. James McClure might have
quietly hammered out differences between their rival bills to make
certain that plastic pistols can't get through airport metal
detectors.
</P>
<P>
But history has taught that a gun control engagement is never
fought with silencers, even in rare instances like this one, when
rival sponsors have identical goals: stopping terrorists,
especially at airports.
</P>
<P>
So once again, bitter enemies of past gun control struggles are
following the usual rules of engagement _ high-powered lobbying,
full-page advertisements, fund-raising appeals and doomsday
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
Sparking the latest debate is a weapon not even on the market.
</P>
<P>
Red Eye Arms of Winter Park, Fla. says it has a patent for plastic
weapons, but won't start making handguns for at least two years _
and then only for military and police use.
``We would never allow anyone to build an undetectable civilian
handgun,'' said company vice president Dwight Brunoehler.
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and McClure, R-Idaho, have vastly different
approaches to require that the guns be made detectable. Both would
ban manufacture or importation of any guns that did not meet their
standards.
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum's bill would require a minimum weight of metal to
ensure that an alarm would be triggered at today's magnetometer
settings. Its target is not only future plastic guns, but pint-size
metal pistols that are not detected today.
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms estimates
there are three small metal guns that could get through most
magnetometers now used. The gun owners' lobby estimates there are
countless other models.
</P>
<P>
McClure's legislation targets plastic guns only, and has no
minimum metallic requirement. However, it would require that guns
be detectable, by either including some metal, a serial number
engraved or stamped on metal, or a substance detectable by X-ray
machines used for luggage.
</P>
<P>
Using today's technology, McClure's bill would require more
sensitive magnetometer settings, more alarms, and therefore more
airport passenger inconvenience _ some say gridlock.
</P>
<P>
Brunoehler, of Red Eye Arms, says his firm has developed a
computer chip for plastic guns that would make the lower settings
unnecessary. The chip would emit a signal that would make it appear
that an enormous amount of metal was passing through the machine,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar said the
FAA is aware of the chip, but believes it could be disabled by
drilling a hole in it or even placing the weapon in a microwave
oven.
</P>
<P>
While these are the technical points for debate, a congressional
gun fight often ranges far beyond the issues at hand and this one
is no exception.
</P>
<P>
The principal gun owner's lobby, the National Rifle Association,
told its 2.8 million members in a fund-raising letter last year
that Metzenbaum's real goal is ``the first federal gun ban bill in
America.''
``If Sen. Metzenbaum's bill passes, the next thing will be some
government official knocking at your door to weigh your guns for
inspection,'' said the NRA, which backs the McClure bill.
</P>
<P>
To Handgun Control Inc., the most visible lobby for pistol
regulation, the issue is what the group calls the NRA's extremism.
``Cop-killer bullets, mail-order handguns, machine guns...has the
NRA gone off the deep end?'' says HCI ads, which have different
police chiefs using those same words.
</P>
<P>
Handgun Control supports Metzenbaum. So do a dozen law
enforcement organizations.
``Both sides are simply waving flags so believers will send
money to Handgun Control Inc. and to the National Rifle
Association,'' says John Aquilino, a former NRA official who now
publishes his own gun owners' newsletter. ``They're making
advertising agencies very wealthy. It's flag-waving and
fund-raising.''
The latest battle reflects new political realities that surfaced
in 1986. Then, the major law enforcement organizations joined
forces with handgun control advocates to fight NRA-backed
legislation to ease many restrictions of the 1968 Gun Control Act.
</P>
<P>
The presence of uniformed policemen lobbying their local
lawmakers began to neutralize some of the NRA's seemingly
invincible clout.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the gun lobby attained many of its goals two years
ago with passage of the McClure-Volkmer Act, which changed a number
of provisions of the 1968 law. But the invigorated gun
control-police alliance was able to retain, as part of that fight,
a ban on interstate sales of handguns.
</P>
<P>
Now, the same coalition of police and gun control advocates is
back on the detectability question. But Jerald R. Vaughn, executive
director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, says
of his fellow police lobbyists, ``We're still babes in the woods
when it comes to the political process.''
Yet, the NRA has taken an unusual turn by backing McClure's
bill. The group normally opposes any legislation that could bring
more restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
Only last May, NRA Governmental Affairs Director James Jay Baker
told a House panel, ``The NRA believes that the only workable
approach'' to the detection problem is better security at airports.
</P>
<P>
He said ``attempts to dictate metallic content of firearms or
chemical composition of non-metallic components of firearms'' were
unnecessary.
``Their position from day one has been, there shall never be any
law on guns,'' said N.T. ``Pete'' Shields, chairman of Handgun
Control Inc.
``All of a sudden this issue of plastic handguns has made them
compromise this whole concept. I think they have come a long way,
but I think they're trying to address it with smoke. McClure's bill
is impractical. You would bottle up the airport.''
Baker said in an interview, ``The NRA has moved a long way on
this issue. We decided to take the bull by the horns and deal with
the terms as framed by the other side. If they're interested in
detectability, it can be done with no interference with existing
firearms.''
Metzenbaum's most prominent Senate ally is Strom Thurmond, a
conservative South Carolina Republican and ranking Republican on
the Judiciary Committee. Metzenbaum and Thurmond tried to win
passage of their legislation last December, but it was tabled by a
47-42 vote.
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum, in an interview, called McClure's bill ``purely
cosmetic.''
McClure, also in an interview, said he rejects any arbitrary
metallic standard, and called any potential inconvenience ``part of
the price you pay for having secure airports.''

Dukakis' Gun Control Stance Provides Ample Ammunition for Bush
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Dukakis' long-time support for tighter
government controls on handguns provided ample ammunition for George
Bush and the National Rifle Asociation.
</P>
<P>
Dukakis, who supports a federal seven-day waiting period on
handgun purchases and a ban on ``Saturday Night Specials,'' accused
his opponent of distorting his stance on gun control.
``I've always supported the right of hunters and sportsmen to own
weapons and (for) people to protect themselves in their own homes,''
the Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
Dukakis backed the so-called Brady amendment to impose a uniform,
mandatory seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases in all
states. Bush opposed the Brady amendment, which went down to a
228-182 defeat Sept. 13 after intense lobbying by the NRA.
</P>
<P>
Bush, a lifetime member of the NRA, elicited cheers from crowds
across the South and West whenever he declared his opposition to new
federal gun controls.
``I'm a sportsman, I'm a hunter, (I) like to do it, and I don't
believe we need the federal government going forward with gun
control legislation,'' Bush told a rally in Billings, Mont.
</P>
<P>
In opposing a federal waiting period, Bush found himself on the
opposite side of several national police organizations, worried
about the vagaries of state laws. Only 22 states now bar instant gun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
Dukakis vehemently denied ever telling a gun owners' lobbyist,
``I don't believe in people owning guns, only the police and
military. And I am going to do everything I can to disarm this
state.''
In 1976, Dukakis supported a Massachusetts referendum to ban
private ownership of handguns. The referendum failed.
</P>
<P>
Dukakis currently favors the ban on Saturday Night Specials, as
well as ``additional efforts to keep guns out of the hands of the
criminally or mentally dangerous, including background checks.''
Dukakis boasts that as governor he supported a law setting a
mandatory one-year prison sentence for those illegally carrying a
gun, and stiffened penalties for felonies commited with a firearm.
</P>
<P>
He says 22,000 Americans are killed each year with handguns.
</P>
<P>
At one point the Dukakis campaign threatened a lawsuit against
the NRA over ads berating the Democrat's record on guns and crime.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, long a favorite of the NRA, came to
the defense of his running mate, saying, ``I saw those ads about
Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you. I sure wouldn't
be running with any fellow if I thought he was going to take my
shotgun away from me.''
Bush said he supports ``mandatory sentences for those caught
using a gun during a crime.'' But in a letter to the NRA, the
Republican attacked what he called the ``gun control myths.''
``Those who invent these myths threaten more than the rights of
our 70 million gun owners and 25 million hunters,'' Bush said.
``Federal licensing, gun registration, background checks, or a ban
on firearms to name a few, would only restrict the rights of the
law-abiding, leaving criminals free to commit crimes with illegal
weapons.''
Dukakis told a crowd in Pueblo, Colo., that the charges he is
against gun ownership are ``a lot of baloney.''
``What I'm concerned about is teen-agers in major cities of this
country running around with Uzis and AK-47s (automatic military
weapons) and killing people'' in street gangs and drug deals,
Dukakis said. ``That's the kind of thing that's got to be
controlled, not innocent sportsmen who have a perfect right to
hunt.''
Bush, as a congressman from Houston, voted for the original
federal Gun Control Act of 1968. That law, enacted after the
assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., barred convicted
felons from buying or owning guns and banned interstate and
mail-order sale of handguns.
</P>
<P>
But Bush says he also supported the 1986 McClure-Volkmer Act that
allowed the interstate sale of rifles and shotguns.
</P>
<P>
Bush, in his campaign literature, says, ``I have always opposed
federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners.'' But he added,
``We must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with the
rights of society. ... We must do all we can to keep guns out of the
hands of convicted criminals.''
In a debate with other Republican candidates before the Gun
Owners of New Hampshire last Feb. 2, Bush said, ``I'm not only a
hunter but I'm a lifetime member of the NRA. I do have a deep
appreciation for the Second Amendment rights'' to keep and bear arms.

Anti-Gun Control Groups Question Study On Handgun Deaths
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-gun control groups and some U.S. law
enforcement officials are questioning the validity of a study that
says the Canadian city of Vancouver is safer than Seattle because of
gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
A study to be published Thursday in the New England Journal of
Medicine concludes that the number of handgun deaths in Vancouver,
British Columbia, 120 miles to the north, between 1980 and 1986 was
nearly one-fifth that of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Henry Sloan, chief investigator for the study, said 388
homicides occurred in Seattle during the study period, while 204
occurred in Vancouver. The number of gun-related deaths in Seattle
was 139, compared with 25 for Vancouver, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sloan, 34, a researcher at the Injury Prevention Research Center
at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center, stopped short Tuesday of
saying his findings prove Seattle's laxer handgun control laws cause
more deaths, but said ``it virtually explains it.''
Gun control activists were quick to seize the opportunity.
``I think that the study clearly puts to rest the notion strong
handgun control laws don't have an effect on levels of crime,'' said
Susan Whitmore, spokeswoman for Washington, D.C.,-based Handgun
Control Inc.
</P>
<P>
John Hosford, executive director of the Seattle-based Citizen's
Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, dismissed the study
as a political ploy to help a gun control initiative on Maryland's
ballot.
``It's not new research,'' Hosford said. ``I don't think the
study is valid, since it doesn't take into account the cause and
effect of many issues.''
And Dr. Paul Blackman, spokesman for the National Rifle
Association in Washington, D.C., criticized the study for not
looking at the period before Vancouver's new gun control laws went
into effect in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Sloan said Vancouver's laws were made stricter in 1978, but
didn't change significantly.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, handguns may legally be purchased for self defense.
</P>
<P>
After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a
handgun as a concealed weapon. Recreational uses are minimally
restricted.
</P>
<P>
In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a legal reason to
purchase a handgun. Concealed weapons are not permitted and
recreational use of handguns such as target shooting and collecting
are regulated by the province. The weapons may only be fired at a
licensed shooting club.
</P>
<P>
In addition, criminal offenses carry stricter penalties than in
the United States, said Vancouver police Sgt. Robert Law.
</P>
<P>
Hosford said that what Seattle needs is not more gun control
laws, but stricter penalties for people convicted of crimes
involving guns.
</P>
<P>
Jim Deschane, commander of the Seattle police West Precinct, said
he believes the process of allowing people to carry handguns in the
city is ``far too lax'' because police can't check applicants'
medical records.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stanley Abrams, a forensic psychologist who has been involved
in investigations of serial murders in Portland, Ore., said easy
availablity of guns can cause more deaths, because it is
psychologically more difficult for someone to use a knife to kill
than to just shoot a gun.
``People who use knives have to be more destructive _ it's
definitely more difficult to kill with a knife,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
And since only 5 percent of murders are planned, a person
carrying a gun makes it that much more likely a murder will occur,
Abrams said.

Murder Rate Soars in D.C. Despite Stiff Gun Control
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past half-year, as the District of
Columbia's murder rate grew ever higher, actor Charlton Heston has
noted ironically in a National Rifle Association television ad:
``They banned guns in this city a decade ago.''
``And the criminals just laugh at their laws,'' he intones,
sirens wailing in the background. ``That tells me guns aren't the
problem. Criminals are.''
The District of Columbia has one of the nation's toughest gun
laws, yet armed violence persists. Of the record 438 murders in the
nation's capital in 1989, about 78 percent were committed with
firearms, says Metropolitan Police Officer Quintin Peterson.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, more than 1,300 people were shot and
wounded. Police estimate that about 60 percent of the killings were
drug-related.
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia's Firearms Control Act of 1975,
implemented in February 1977, banned the sale of handguns with a
few exceptions for law enforcement and security personnel and
required registration of all firearms previously purchased. Those
seeking to register the weapons also had to submit to a thorough
background check.
</P>
<P>
So where are these guns coming from?
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which
compiles an annual report on guns retrieved in crimes in
Washington, found 52 percent of those collected in 1989 came from
Virginia, a slight increase over 1988, and 18 percent came from
Maryland, up from 15 percent from the previous year, said Dick
Pedersen of the ATF office covering Washington, Maryland and
Virginia.
``If you put them together, you have 70 percent'' of the guns,
he said. ``You can basically disregard the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
We're looking at ones and twos from rest of the union, people
moving in and losing their gun, having it stolen.''
The study is based on traces of several hundred guns each year
which are randomly selected, he said. A total of 2,333 firearms
were picked up in Washington last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
While some of the weapons are rifles, ``This is really a handgun
city and a handgun area,'' Pedersen said. ``We're finding more than
half the guns picked up in crime now are semiautomatic handguns,
and that appears to be growing, based on the last couple of years.''
In many cases, these are not the now-infamous Saturday Night
Specials, cheap handguns bought on the spur of the moment.
``We find a lot of high-quality firearms, a direct result of the
drug trade,'' Pedersen said. ``They can afford high quality, and
they buy them.''
Some are the same weapons used by police forces around the
country, 9mm semiautomatic handguns that cost $500 to $700 apiece,
he said. At the same time, many of the guns are small and
concealable .25-caliber semiautomatic pistols that cost about $200,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The NRA contends that Washington's murder rate _ the highest in
the nation _ demonstrates that gun control doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
Gun control laws vary widely in the major cities with some of
the highest murder rates in 1988. The top 12 among the 35 U.S.
cities with 400,000 or more people included four cities with no gun
control measures, including Detroit, which has the second highest
murder rate.
</P>
<P>
Seven more of the 12 had relatively strong gun control laws,
while one, Miami, had a three-day cooling off period for a gun
purchase, but no background check on the buyer.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Honolulu, covered by a strong state gun
control measure, showed the lowest murder rate among the 35 largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials and gun control advocates say there's
more to the issue than whether an individual city has strong
controls.
</P>
<P>
They say Washington's location _ carved out of Maryland and
Virginia with virtually no natural boundaries other than the easily
crossed Potomac River _ makes its handgun ban virtually
unenforceable.
``In Washington, you can drive across the river and purchase
handguns,'' said Susan Whitmore of Handgun Control Inc. ``Until
this last year, Virginia had one of the weakest gun laws in the
country.''
New York City has the same problem, she said.
``More than 90 percent (of the guns used in New York crimes)
come from other states with very weak laws,'' Whitmore said.
``That's why we believe we need a national law.''
A new law in Virginia that took effect Nov. 1, 1989, requires an
immediate background check prior to the purchase of assault-style
weapons and most handguns. A person wishing to buy a gun must
complete an application and the gun dealer must call the Virginia
State Police to get approval for the sale.
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 31, 1989, Virginia officials had approved 9,834 sales
_ each of which could involve numerous guns _ and rejected 109
applications, said state police Lt. R. Lewis Vass, who runs the
program.
</P>
<P>
The program has produced an unexpected dividend: the capture of
three fugitives, one from Florida and two from New Jersey. By state
law, police have until the close of business the day after a
gun-purchase application has been rejected to tell the gun dealer
the rejection is confirmed or a search of records found the sale
could be made. As a result, some people rejected initially have
returned to gun stores the next day to get the final decision. In
three cases, police were waiting when the fugitives returned, Vass
said.
</P>
<P>
Officials also are hoping prosecution of certain gun dealers
will curb illicit sales. Donald P. Percival, a former U.S. Park
Police officer who owned gun stores in Virginia, and James S.
</P>
<P>
Chapman, a former D.C. police officer and retired Secret Service
uniformed agent, were convicted in November of illegally selling
semiautomatic handguns to an 18-year-old drug dealer who resold or
traded the weapons for drugs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
While Whitmore said she was encouraged by Virginia's new law,
Pedersen said it's still too early to tell what impact it will have
on gunfire in Washington, saying the problem occurs when legitimate
purchasers in Virginia provide weapons to people who would be
ineligible to purchase them legally.
</P>
<P>
Gun control groups want national laws, but one law enforcement
official says regional controls might be sufficient.
``If you were in a town that had mountains or deserts around it
and people had to travel four hours and take two interstates to get
to the area, I can see how you might control a problem like this,''
the officer said. But in Washington, ``It's like walking across the
street to get a hamburger. We're one large urban area here. It's
hard to keep guns out of D.C. when there are no natural borders.''

FT  27 NOV 93 / Guns 'n' poses: George Graham examines an important victory
for US advocates of tougher firearms laws
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The smoke has cleared a little. After seven long years, the US Congress this
week passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations
of Mr Robert Kennedy and Rev Martin Luther King Jr in 1968.
</P>
<P>
The legislation - known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady, the former
White House press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on
President Ronald Reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on
purchases of handguns. It would give law enforcement authorities time to
check the buyer's background.
</P>
<P>
Advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over
stubborn resistance by Republican senators from western states such as Idaho
and Alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the
US.
</P>
<P>
The Brady bill's opponents in Congress say it will inconvenience only
law-abiding citizens, not criminals who buy or steal their weapons away from
the government's prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
They point to glaring failings in the federal government's policing of the
276,000 licensed gun dealers in the US as evidence of the Brady bill's
likely ineffectiveness. For instance, one newspaper reporter successfully
obtained a dealer's licence for his dog by submitting a made-up social
security number.
</P>
<P>
Studies of state laws requiring some form of background check suggest,
however, that at least some sales to convicted felons have been stopped, and
some suspected criminals have been caught when they tried to buy a gun.
</P>
<P>
But even the most ardent supporters of the Brady bill acknowledge that it
will make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year of
new or used firearms, let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation;
and will barely affect the more than 14,000 murders and 1,400 accidental
deaths involving guns each year.
</P>
<P>
'The longest journey begins with a single step,' Mr Brady said after the
bill's final passage in the Senate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite its uncertain effect, passage of the Brady bill is read by some as a
sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control. Other
initiatives in Congress and in state legislatures are under way: the Senate
last week agreed in a separate bill to ban assault weapons, a measure
already in force in California, New Jersey and Connecticut. Virginia has
passed a law restricting people to one gun purchase a month.
</P>
<P>
With the federal government considering the imposition of punitive taxes on
some particularly devastating types of ammunition, the Winchester company
recently decided to withdraw its Black Talon bullet. This is prized by some
game hunters for its killing power but detested by emergency room doctors
for the damage it inflicts on humans as it mushrooms on impact.
</P>
<P>
The strength of public feeling about rampant gun use has clearly grown in
the face of an apparently unstoppable wave of urban violence that has
brought the rate of death by shooting among young black men to more than 150
per 100,000, and led to the installation of metal detectors in city schools.
</P>
<P>
The fear of violent crimes such as carjackings and drive-by shootings has
spread even beyond the inner city and into the suburbs and the countryside,
provoking a widespread feeling that something - anything - must be done.
</P>
<P>
The message from an outraged public is not, however, unequivocally in favour
of gun control.
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, while thousands of people have been telephoning their
Republican senators to demand that they stop blocking the Brady bill,
thousands have also been flocking to join the National Rifle Association,
the leading organisation among the pro-gun lobbies. In the past year and a
half, it has gained 1,000 members a day to bring its total, which had
declined to about 2.6m in 1991, to a record of about 3.3m. Many new members
and gun owners are women.
</P>
<P>
Recent election results have shown, too, that simply being tough on guns is
not enough to woo the voters. Although Democratic Governor Jim Florio of New
Jersey came close to victory in the gubernatorial race this month by
striking a tougher stance on both guns and crime in general than his
Republican challenger, Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, this was not enough.
</P>
<P>
Voters were swayed by economic considerations and particularly by his
first-term tax increase.
</P>
<P>
In Virginia, meanwhile, Ms Mary Sue Terry, the Democratic candidate for
governor, relied in her campaign on gun control and was thrashed by Mr
George Allen, her Republican opponent, who did not favour tighter curbs but
promised to be tough on criminals by abolishing parole.
</P>
<P>
While such results do not indicate that the NRA has been routed, they have
put the association on the defensive. Most members now favour some form of
gun control, but the core membership opposes all restraints on the sale of
firearms. Their beliefs are rooted in an almost theological  - some would
say fanatical - interpretation of the second amendment to the US
constitution, which states that: 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary
to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear
arms, shall not be infringed.'
'The second amendment is not about duck-hunting. In the 1990s, it is about
self-defence,' says Mr James Jay Baker, the NRA's chief Washington lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
To many members, the right to self-defence is not just against muggers or
burglars, but against a tyrannical government. Mr Neal Knox, sacked from a
lobbying position with the NRA in the 1980s but now one of its elected
directors, argues that the second amendment is the citizen's 'freedom
insurance plan' against tyranny.

Mr Knox says the Holocaust would not have happened if Europe's Jews had
owned rifles, and if the Nazis had not been able to confiscate guns, thanks
to gun registration laws passed in the 1930s. He also contends that the
solution to Somalia's problems is to arm Somali mothers with AK-47s.
</P>
<P>
Such beliefs have led the NRA to campaign against restrictions on machine
guns, assault weapons and armour-piercing bullets. In the process they have
lost touch with many of their members, who back gun control in general and
specifically the Brady bill.
</P>
<P>
Two trends over the past few years have weakened the advocates of gun
rights. First, left-wing Democrats have begun to champion gun control as a
supplement to tough anti-crime measures, rather than an alternative; they
have recaptured much of the 'tough on crime' high ground by backing boot
camps for young delinquents, harsher sentences and stiffer restrictions on
parole or habeas corpus appeals.
</P>
<P>
The NRA is trying to fight back with a campaign called CrimeStrike, calling
for harsher measures against criminals.
</P>
<P>
Second, the NRA's insistence on combating any gun control, even that viewed
as reasonable by a majority not just of the US population but of gun-owners,
has driven away some former political and police supporters.
</P>
<P>
Senator Denis DeConcini of Arizona, once voted the NRA's 'legislator of the
month', is backing a ban on assault weapons. Delegate Clinton Miller of the
Virginia state assembly, once rated 'A+' by the NRA, now calls the
organisation's top members 'hateful, spiteful, arrogant'.
</P>
<P>
This alienation is apparent among gun-owners at large. According to a Gallup
poll earlier this year, 57 per cent of people who said they had a gun in
their house also favoured stricter laws on the sale of firearms.
</P>
<P>
These converts to gun control, however, are a long way from believing that
the answer to violent crime lies in more radical action, such as the
proposal of Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, for a complete
ban on handguns.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans may move in this direction, but many more may put their faith
in self-defence and buy their own weapons.

BILL TO OUTLAW MILITARY-TYPE GUNS NEARS COMPLETION 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SACRAMENTO 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statewide coalition of law enforcement officials, formed last fall to respond 
to what they see as the proliferation of military-type semiautomatic firearms 
among street gangs and drug dealers, has nearly completed the task of drafting 
legislation to outlaw the manufacture and sale of such guns. 
</P>
<P>
As they prepare for a showdown in the Legislature with the powerful gun lobby, 
the coalition - whose leaders include Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Alameda County Dist. Atty. John J. 
Meehan - has made passage of the bill its top priority of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"If law enforcement doesn't attempt to do something about it now, we are just 
going to have a whole higher level of arms race in California, and it is going 
to be extremely dangerous for innocent people," said Richard Inglehart, an 
Alameda County prosecutor and member of the task force drafting the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is aimed at semiautomatic rifles like the Uzi, AK-47 and AR-15, 
available over the counter to anyone 18 or older who provides identification 
and fills out a form declaring that he is not a drug addict, a fugitive or a 
mentally unstable person. By contrast, purchasers of handguns must wait 15 days 
for a state background investigation before taking possession of their 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
A bruising fight with the politically powerful National Rifle Assn. and the Gun 
Owners of California seems assured. Traditionally, the Legislature has been 
reluctant to enact anything that smacks of controls on guns or firearm 
ownership. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. once observed that in California, 
"you don't mess with a man's guns or cars." 
</P>
<P>
"It will be one of the donnybrooks of the legislative session," predicted Gary 
Mullen, executive director of the California District Attorneys Assn., of the 
campaign that will pit the NRA against the police. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist David Marshall of the NRA, a veteran of previous unsuccessful attempts 
to outlaw military-type semiautomatics, maintains that a prohibition against 
such firearms will not deter criminals intent on getting them but will work to 
the disadvantage of law-abiding Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"Leave the law-abiding citizen alone," he said. "Go after the criminals and 
nail them to the wall and stop treating them with kid gloves. Get them off the 
streets. Give them mandatory jail time. No plea-bargaining. No probation. No 
parole." 
</P>
<P>
Popular Military Type 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the weapon of choice for drug dealers and street gangs is the 
military-style semiautomatic gun that often is easily concealed and can be 
converted to a full automatic. At semiautomatic, the rifle fires one bullet at 
a time as fast as the trigger is pulled. On automatic, one squeeze sends out a 
stream of fire like a machine gun's. 
</P>
<P>
Under a law sponsored by the NRA, it is illegal in California to convert a 
semiautomatic to a full automatic. Likewise, it is illegal to possess a machine 
gun without a permit from the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The drafters of the proposed law enforcement gun bill say they are close to 
agreement on language in the bill that would outlaw the manufacture and sale of 
certain "bad guns" but exempt "good guns" - those used by hunters, competitive 
target shooters and collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty is in distinguishing between semiautomatic military weapons and 
the semiautomatic rifles and shotguns used by sportsmen, because all operate on 
basically the same principle. 
</P>
<P>
Broad Definition 
</P>
<P>
The bill would establish a broad generic definition that would fit military 
assault-type semiautomatics and be based on such things as the length of barrel 
and size of the bullet magazine. Some existing weapons would actually be banned 
by name. However, certain sporting guns that may resemble the prohibited 
firearms would be exempted by name. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would allow manufacturers of the military-style weapons to 
obtain a permit to sell the guns that is similar to what is required for 
machine guns. In general, however, they would not be allowed to sell to 
civilian outlets in California. 
</P>
<P>
A commission would be created to approve or reject new guns that come on the 
market in the future. The commission, as yet of unspecified membership, could 
add prohibited guns to the list, which sponsors said would be short, at least 
initially. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has undergone at least 10 drafts, is expected to be introduced 
next month. No legislator has yet been asked to carry the measure, proponents 
said, although Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) has 
promised to author such a bill. 
</P>
<P>
Strategists for the task force conceded that assuring hunters, collectors and 
sportsmen that their guns are "safe" and would not be affected by the bill is a 
key element in winning its approval by a Legislature highly sensitive to 
gun-owning constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure the bill doesn't affect hunters and sportsmen, even 
though the NRA will take it on and be opposed to it," said prosecutor 
Inglehart. "But there are some guns that are not designed or meant to be used 
for hunting." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Block, an outspoken opponent of semiautomatic assault weapons, said he 
believes there is a need to "selectively regulate and, if necessary, prohibit 
certain kinds of weaponry in the interests of public safety. These weapons are 
legally available. People have exercised what is a right under the law (to 
purchase them) and I think the law has to be changed." 
</P>
<P>
Retired Senator Active 
</P>
<P>
Joining in the fight against the legislation will be the Gun Owners of 
California, a political action committee headed by retired Sen. H. L. 
Richardson. The Glendora Republican now is in the business of producing 
conservative political videos. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said he intends to blanket the state with thousands of videos 
opposing the legislation, just as he did when he campaigned for the defeat of 
former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Gun control advocates, who were active in earlier attempts to outlaw 
military-type semiautomatic rifles, have made the tactical decision to remain 
on the sidelines in this struggle. For many gun owners and legislators, gun 
control is a code phrase for confiscating firearms. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking our cue from law enforcement and looking to them for leadership 
on this issue," said Louis Tolley, state director of Handgun Control Inc. "We 
are very anxious to support them. They have the expertise in defining these 
assault weapons and how best to restrict them. We don't have that expertise."

THE NRA FIGHTS BACK; 
ON THE DEFENSIVE OVER ASSAULT WEAPONS, THE GUN LOBBY IS USING CONTROVERSIAL 
TACTICS TO TARGET ITS ENEMIES 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IN BLOOD-RED letters, the sign on the front window of the Dealers Outlet gun 
store in suburban Phoenix declared: "Urgent! Act Now! Stop the Gun Ban!" 
Inside, customers took time out from browsing through AK-47 assault rifles and 
a flock of other firearms to sign a petition - and to vent their wrath at a 
local "turncoat," U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
"We are petitioning to protest the semiautomatic gun-control bills before 
Congress," read the text above a fast-growing list of names. "If we allow the 
government to become involved in any type of gun control, we are violating a 
basic constitutional right, the right to keep and bear arms." 
</P>
<P>
The petitioners' target that sunny day last spring was DeConcini, a longtime 
opponent of gun-control measures who had suddenly switched sides, sponsoring 
one of the nine bills currently in Congress to ban the sale of assault weapons. 
"I'm a one-issue voter, and I'm going to do everything in my power to take 
DeConcini out," George Hiers, a burly man on crutches, vowed as he bought a 
semiautomatic shotgun for his wife to defend herself with while he's away on 
hunting trips. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on DeConcini was stirred up by the National Rifle Assn. in a display 
of fury that represented far more than retaliation against a former supporter. 
Long described as "the powerful gun lobby," the NRA is now scrambling to 
recover from stunning setbacks in the past three years. Over the NRA's 
opposition, Congress and state legislatures have enacted legislation banning 
"cop-killer bullets" that penetrate protective vests, plastic guns that can be 
slipped past metal detectors and "Saturday night specials" that are used in 
many crimes. And most recently, the group found itself caught in the furor over 
assault weapons that was ignited by the massacre of five children in a Stockton 
schoolyard last January. Those killings, combined with the increasing use of 
the weapons by drug dealers and youth gangs, have exacerbated the contentious 
relations between the NRA and its former allies. 
</P>
<P>
Law-enforcement leaders, concerned about rising violence and terrorism, have 
ended their friendliness toward the gun lobby and become well-organized in 
opposition. Politicians once fearful of the NRA have been much more willing to 
stand up to it; President Bush, an NRA "Life Member," on July 7 imposed a 
permanent ban on imports of assault rifles and has proposed limiting the 
semiautomatics' ammunition clips. The ban so infuriated some NRA members that 
they have launched petition drives in two dozen states to oust Bush from the 
organization. Meanwhile, California, whose voters only seven years ago defeated 
an initiative that would have frozen the number of handguns in the state, last 
May became the first state to ban assault weapons. At the same time, 
gun-control organizations are beginning to match the NRA's mass mailings, ads 
and lobbying; many schools are showing "Guns and the Constitution," an anti-gun 
video produced by Handgun Control Inc., whose chairwoman is Sarah Brady, wife 
of former White House Press Secretary James Brady, who was disabled by gunfire 
in the 1981 assassination attempt on then-President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
And the NRA even is feeling pressure from more-militant gun groups that 
threaten to drain away members and funds. Although enjoying a membership surge, 
the NRA ran up a record $5.9-million deficit last year after spending more than 
$83 million. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in fending off the assaults on assault weapons, the 118-year-old NRA is 
facing what its leaders call its most daunting challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a crossroads," James Jay Baker, the NRA's top congressional lobbyist, 
acknowledged as DeConcini's assault-weapons bill cleared its first Senate 
hurdle in April. "We're going to go down the road of either prohibitive 
firearms regulations or tough criminal justice provisions" - that is, more 
prosecutors, penalties and prisons, the course sought by the NRA. "Once you get 
into a (gun-control) rut, it's tough to get out of that rut." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the nation's capital, two of the hottest battlegrounds in the 
assault-weapons fight are Arizona and Florida. That would seem ironic, since 
guns permeate the cultures of those generally conservative states. But with 
opinion polls in both states showing that large majorities of residents support 
bans - and with police complaining about being outgunned by criminals - 
legislators have moved into action, spurring angry counterattacks from the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
Call Now! Write Today! 
</P>
<P>
AS PAT JONAS signed the petition in the gun store near Phoenix, one could 
witness the NRA's true political power: mobilizing citizens at the grass roots. 
"I don't want to see guns outlawed," Jonas said, "because I like to collect 
guns." Probably no other organization in the world floods government officials 
with as many phone calls, letters, telegrams and visits from its members as the 
NRA. Charles J. Orasin, president of 15-year-old Handgun Control - the NRA's 
chief nemesis - estimates that as many as 500,000 members of the NRA and other 
gun groups regularly lobby elected officials and bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
The outpouring is prompted by red-alert mailings churned out by NRA leaders, 
all sounding essentially the same alarm: They're out to get your guns. These 
letters go not only to the NRA's 2.9 million members, whose $25 annual 
membership fee brings such benefits as a magazine, gun-theft insurance and 
safety instruction, but also to 10,000 affiliated hunting organizations and 
shooting-competition groups. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, the NRA has proved that citizen action generated by such 
mailings can have far more effect on legislation than opinion polls, especially 
when a majority for gun control is relatively silent. "If a lawmaker is looking 
for an excuse to vote with the NRA, all he has to say is, 'I got a hundred 
calls from the NRA, but none from the other side,' " said a congressional aide. 
And in a close election, a well-organized, single-interest group such as the 
NRA can wield decisive power by turning out highly motivated voters. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of these red-alert warnings, written by NRA lobbyist Baker, that had 
been delivered to 100,000 gun owners in Arizona and riled up the customers at 
the Dealers Outlet outside Phoenix. Baker's letter assailed DeConcini's bill, a 
scaled-down version of the one enacted by California in May. DeConcini's bill 
calls for a nationwide ban on sales of AK-47s and eight other semiautomatic 
rifles - guns enjoying wide popularity because they have the menacing look and 
much of the firepower of fully automatic assault weapons used by the military 
and police. (Automatic guns fire 20 bullets or so per trigger pull; 
semiautomatics fire one bullet per trigger squeeze, but a fast index finger can 
get off as many as 20 shots in five seconds as ammunition is automatically 
reloaded from a clip. And many semiautomatics can easily be converted to 
automatic weapons.) 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Baker called DeConcini's proposal a "tragic mistake," charging 
that it could even block sales of traditional hunting rifles and lead to 
criminal charges against 30 million sportsmen who own semiautomatic guns. "Does 
anyone seriously believe (Senate Bill) 747 will stop drug smugglers . . . who 
bring cocaine by the planeload . . . from bringing in any guns they want and 
selling them on the profitable black market Senator DeConcini's bill will 
create?" Baker's letter asked. It concluded with a call to arms, warning that 
DeConcini "needs to know we will not allow our constitutional freedoms to be 
strangled by restrictions that have absolutely no effect on the criminals who 
are supposed to be the real target! . . . CALL NOW! WRITE TODAY!" 
</P>
<P>
"Lies and Exaggerations" 
</P>
<P>
GUN OWNERS' rage spread quickly after the NRA letter hit Arizona the last week 
of April. In three weeks, DeConcini's office received 6,395 calls and letters 
against his bill and 68 for it, despite a poll indicating that more than 
two-thirds of the people in metropolitan Phoenix favor some kind of ban on 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to the four corners of Arizona, and people are shocked and dismayed" 
by DeConcini's bill, said Landis Aden, a motorcycle-riding computer technician 
who lobbies part time for the Arizona NRA. Aden believes that semiautomatic 
guns would come in handy if a Mexican revolution spilled over the border and 
Arizonans got caught in the cross fire. "You could defend your farm or your 
ranch fairly well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Mandall, a brash Scottsdale gun dealer who insisted that a reporter feel 
the thrill of firing Uzi and AK-47 machine guns at a range in his store 
basement, vowed during a conversation there to "work with the utmost severity 
to get DeConcini out of office." He said he had sold three years' stock of 
assault rifles in the two weeks after Bush issued a temporary import ban in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
"People are talking recall here," said Lee Echols, range master for the Phoenix 
Rod and Gun Club. "We stood behind DeConcini at the last election, and we feel 
he has completely betrayed us." Another member of the club, Bill Houston, 
telephoned DeConcini aide Matthew McCoy in his Washington office to protest. 
McCoy's end of the conversation went this way: 
</P>
<P>
"You're misinterpreting the legislation. . . . Recall election? I think that 
will hurt everybody and not help anybody. . . . You think that by attempting to 
burn your friends you can . . . If the alternative were something more strict 
than DeConcini's legislation, how would you feel then? Metzenbaum is going to 
come from somewhere out of left field." Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) is 
pushing a ban that is much broader than DeConcini's. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in his Phoenix office as the firestorm was building, a serene 
DeConcini accused the NRA of "lies and exaggerations" about his bill; he 
strongly disputed the NRA's claim that a provision banning any gun "nearly 
identical" to the nine listed in the measure could be interpreted to cover 
virtually all semiautomatics. The recently re-elected senator said he was 
trying to head off more-drastic legislation from Metzenbaum and others, 
including California Democratic Reps. Howard L. Berman of Panorama City and 
Fortney H. (Pete) Stark of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
But DeConcini was also careful to take political cover behind two Republicans 
who are NRA "Life Members." He noted Bush's import ban and cited a salty 
declaration by Barry M. Goldwater, Arizona's venerable former senator, that 
semiautomatic guns "have no place in anybody's arsenal. If any S.O.B. can't hit 
a deer with one shot, then he ought to quit shooting." (Goldwater made the 
remark shortly after appearing in a full-page, "I'm the NRA" ad in Time 
magazine.) 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini, an NRA "Person of the Month" last year, said that NRA officials 
"flat told me, 'We can't negotiate' " on his bill because "they were burned so 
badly last year when they negotiated with (then-Atty. Gen. Edwin) Meese on 
banning plastic guns. They said their membership and revenues fell off. . . . 
Now they need to get members and money, and that's why they're doing this to 
me. . . . If I weren't a mature person, I'd say, 'Up yours. Now I'm going to be 
a gun-control advocate, and you're going to lose me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Later, he said at a Senate hearing on his bill: "By using these tactics, the 
NRA is succeeding only in alienating its friend closest to the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Foxes in the Henhouse 
</P>
<P>
AS THE NRA waged its war in the West, Marion P. Hammer, a 50-year-old 
grandmother with brown bangs, strode to the front of another heated 
battleground in Tallahassee, Fla., a packed meeting room in the state's House 
of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
A subcommittee was getting ready to vote on a bill that would ban a list of 
semiautomatic assault weapons, and Hammer had asked to speak against it. Only 4 
feet, 11 inches tall, she could barely be seen as she took the podium. Her gray 
slacks, blue ruffled blouse and blue suede jacket complemented her steel-blue 
eyes but belied her credentials: prize-winning marksman and hardball lobbyist 
for the Florida NRA. 
</P>
<P>
To her supporters, Hammer represents all that is strong about the NRA; to her 
detractors, much that is weak. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking the crux of the bill, Hammer told the subcommittee: "You cannot 
differentiate between semiautomatic firearms that look menacing and your 
routine sporting firearms because, functionally, they are the same." 
</P>
<P>
Next, she dealt acidly with one of the NRA's prickliest political problems: 
"There are some law-enforcement officers who are NRA members who are against 
us. I would suggest to you that it would not be the first time that the fox has 
been in the henhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as NRA Washington lobbyist Baker had done in his letter to Arizona gun 
owners, Hammer charged that a loosely worded definition in the Florida bill 
would inadvertently ban all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. That is, the ban 
would cover not just the targeted guns - the ones with folding stocks that 
make them easy to conceal, pistol grips, huge ammunition clips and flash 
suppressors that, according to police, make it easy to spray bullets from the 
hip. But doomed as well, she claimed, would be firearms of traditional design 
long used by hunters and target shooters in one of the nation's gun-owningest 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking away firearms from law-abiding citizens who have lawfully owned them 
for decades is not the solution" to violent crime, she declared. 
</P>
<P>
One might have expected the House subcommittee to reject the bill handily on 
that April day. After all, two years earlier, Hammer had led a phenomenal 
victory for the NRA in Florida, winning passage of measures that threw out all 
locally imposed gun restrictions. The action was so sweeping that many Sunshine 
Staters thought that they had been freed to carry guns openly, Wild West-style. 
The Legislature later closed that seeming loophole in the wake of widespread 
hoots about the "Gunshine State." But it left intact all other provisions, 
including one making it much easier in many areas to obtain a concealed-weapon 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer has skillfully built support for the changes in the gun laws over many 
years. Rising at 4 a.m. after less than four hours' sleep, chain-smoking 
filter-tip cigarettes, sipping diet sodas - and aided only by one part-time 
staffer and a $125,000 yearly budget - she tirelessly works Capitol corridors 
and grinds out newsletters aimed at firing up the NRA's 130,000 Florida members 
to contact their representatives. Once, she threw a party at a firing range for 
legislators, aides, spouses and children; hundreds feasted on shrimp and 
oysters, and many took shooting lessons from expert instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Testimonials to Hammer's lobbying efforts - not to mention her marksmanship 
with muzzle-loading rifles - cover the walls of her office. Among the plaques 
and pictures is a Winchester .30-30 carbine from the National Antique Arms 
Assn., recognizing her as the first woman to receive its "Roy Rogers Man of the 
Year Award." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her past successes, however, the House panel voted 5-1 to pass the 
assault-weapons bill along to the full Criminal Justice Committee. Hammer still 
would have several opportunities to halt the bill's progress. But the 
surprising setback symbolized the NRA's shifting fortunes, not only in Florida, 
but across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The NRA has been unreasonable with their positions for so long, it's catching 
up with them now," asserted Rep. Ronald A. Silver, a Miami Beach Democrat who 
chairs the criminal justice panel. One of the NRA's major problems, he said, is 
that a number of legislative allies have been angered by its strong-arm tactics 
when the group decided they went astray. 
</P>
<P>
Dramatic evidence of this cropped up the day before the House action, when Sen. 
John A. Grant Jr., a conservative Tampa Republican who heads a companion Senate 
committee, was being interviewed about prospects for an assault-weapons ban. As 
Hammer sat casually on a table nearby, waiting to request that an NRA videotape 
be shown to the panel, Grant remarked that "the gun lobby is very 
well-organized, and I give them credit for being able to rally the troops on 
very short notice." But asked if the NRA provides accurate information, he 
responded, with a backward glance at Hammer: "Well, sometimes they get a little 
bit overzealous. When they said I was part of the Gestapo last year, that was a 
little out of order." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer explained later that Grant was referring to a newsletter in which she 
had said that a bill in his committee "sets up a modern-day Gestapo movement" 
because it threatened to invalidate many concealed-weapon permits. "I wasn't 
calling members of that committee Gestapo," she maintained. Nevertheless, Grant 
was so enraged that he had an aide call NRA officials in Washington to demand 
her removal. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. George G. Kirkpatrick Jr. (D-Gainesville) protested in an interview 
that he had been savagely attacked by Hammer's group in his latest campaign 
despite a "strong pro-gun" voting record. "They wrote the most vicious 
letters," he said. "They called me Judas" because he had backed a Senate 
leadership team viewed by the NRA as sympathetic to controls on handguns and 
assault weapons. Kirkpatrick, who easily won re-election, predicted that such 
tactics will backfire. "Because of the NRA's unwillingness to sit down and work 
out a reasonable solution to problems perceived by the public, it makes it much 
more difficult to get their mission accomplished," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hammer: "He's very bitter, but I have a job to do. We have a right to 
vigorously oppose anyone whose actions are detrimental to our best interests." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer faces another growing problem: competition from lobbyists on the other 
side. For instance, the day of the House subcommittee vote on assault weapons, 
she was outmaneuvered by Bernard Horn, the state legislative director for 
Handgun Control, who had flown in from Washington. Horn gave legislators a 
booklet picturing both the 27 guns proposed for banning and other semiautomatic 
rifles that were not on the list but that are popular with hunters. The move 
was aimed at shattering the NRA's claim that only cosmetic differences exist 
between assault weapons and sporting guns. 
</P>
<P>
The effect on subcommittee member Carol Hanson (R-Boca Raton) was decisive. 
Because of the booklet, she said, she was no longer willing to support merely a 
limit on the capacity of ammunition clips - a fallback position to which 
Hammer had reluctantly acceded. Now, Hanson said, she favored banning the guns 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Hammer was able to minimize her losses. Instead of banning assault 
weapons, the Legislature in June created a commission to study them. And, 
instead of enacting a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers, as sought by 
Handgun Control, it required dealers to make a less-comprehensive background 
check by telephoning a police computer. Voters will decide next year whether to 
accept a three-day waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
Although a Handgun Control news release declared, "Florida Deals NRA Fourth 
Loss of Year," Hammer was able to say with some justification, "I think we did 
pretty good." The tide turned her way, she claimed, after legislators saw how 
student demonstrators in China were overwhelmed by troops "because they were 
unarmed." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after adjourning, the Legislature was called back into special session 
to reconsider a bill that would make it illegal for gun owners to carelessly 
leave weapons around children. The NRA had helped kill the measure weeks 
earlier. But after a spate of gun accidents killed three children and wounded 
three others in early June, Hammer gave conditional support to the bill, and it 
passed overwhelmingly.

Rambo Sells 
</P>
<P>
ON A BREEZY DAY last spring, a riot of orange- and gold-striped tulips swayed 
outside the gunmetal gray NRA headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the eight-story building, many of the 365 employees worked on gun-safety 
courses, shooting competitions, police firearms training and other services 
that predominated at the NRA until heavy lobbying against gun control began in 
the 1970s. The shift came after the murders of two Kennedys and a King inspired 
passage of major federal gun regulations in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
In his seventh-floor office, Jim Baker - one of five in-house lobbyists 
supplemented by four high-powered outsiders - had put the finishing touches on 
his letter to Arizona gun owners, slamming DeConcini's bill. "I want this 
carefully fly-specked" for mistakes, he told a secretary as he left for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Over a roast beef sandwich and beer at a plush hotel restaurant, the handsome, 
35-year-old former prosecutor was asked whether Barry Goldwater's assertion 
that hunters don't need assault weapons had undermined the NRA's effort to 
prevent the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need any particular gun. You don't need to hunt. But I don't think 
you should have to justify anything in terms of need. That's a socialist 
concept. You ought to be able to own within reasonable limits what you want. 
The question is whether these proposals will fight crime effectively, and we 
think highly restrictive gun controls are a bankrupt concept." 
</P>
<P>
Baker argued that claims of assault-weapon violence are grossly exaggerated and 
that the Stockton massacre could have been carried out with almost any gun, not 
just the semiautomatic AK-47 wielded by Patrick Purdy. 
</P>
<P>
A bit more candidly, J. Warren Cassidy, the NRA's executive vice president, 
later acknowledged that the Goldwater comment had hurt badly. Cassidy said a 
number of concerned NRA members wrote him, asking, "What are you going to do 
about this?" He wrote back, asking, "What do you want me to do? I can't recall 
him, he's out of office - he's an American legend." But Cassidy noted in the 
interview: "When a guy like Barry or Dennis DeConcini does these things, it's a 
belt to the solar plexus, because you've counted on these fellows." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Korologos, one of the NRA's well-connected outside lobbyists, recalled 
another example of the difficulty of fighting off assault-weapon bans. He said 
that while touring exhibition booths at the NRA's recent national convention, 
he came across "a basic .22 rifle that had a big banana clip and a big round 
thing to hold it with. It looked for all the world like Rambo's personal gun." 
Korologos asked the exhibitor, "Why are you ruining this perfectly legitimate 
rifle?" 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," came the response, "but they sell." 
</P>
<P>
Korologos commented: "Never mind it doesn't do us any good on Capitol Hill to 
have those damn things loose." 
</P>
<P>
An NRA operative conceded that, despite a tough "no-compromise" resolution 
unanimously adopted at the national convention, the NRA might have to back a 
compromise bill when Congress takes final action on assault weapons. "We may be 
branded as traitors, but that's the nature of the game in this town, to forge 
agreements and compromises," said the source, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, in the face of increasingly well-organized support for gun control, 
the NRA grudgingly compromised on cop-killer bullets in 1986 and plastic guns 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
To fight assault-weapon bills, Baker said, the NRA hopes to spend $5 million, 
most of it derived from direct-mail appeals. The organization's revenues last 
year included $45.4 million from membership dues and $9.4 million from 
contributions. About one-fourth of the $83.6 million in expenditures was spent 
on lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NRA is continuing to contribute heavily to political 
campaigns, despite the disappointments it suffered in last year's elections. In 
1988, five incumbents and all 15 challengers supported by the NRA were 
defeated; although 182 incumbents won, the NRA netted no gain with the $770,000 
it poured into campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
For the assault-weapons fight, the NRA has sent dozens of police officers to 
Washington to offset pro-ban lobbying by police chiefs, launched a national 
newspaper and TV ad campaign and continued to make available to gun owners a 
900 toll phone number that has already produced thousands of NRA form letters 
to President Bush and members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Baker denied that NRA officials had anything to do with the petition drive to 
purge Bush from membership, saying that it originated with rank-and-filers 
"obviously disappointed with the President's first six months in office." But 
he added that the NRA board of directors would be forced to consider the matter 
at its September meeting. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the NRA harshly retaliated against police chiefs who spoke out for 
gun control, seeking to get chiefs fired in Nashville, Tenn., and Baltimore 
County, Md. But Dover, N.H., Chief Charles Reynolds, president of the 
International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, said that he and NRA President Joe 
Foss recently agreed to "keep the debate issue-oriented, without personal 
attacks." 
</P>
<P>
The most frequent charge against the NRA is the one leveled by DeConcini - 
that it lies and exaggerates. Denying this, Baker said "a survey of Congress" 
by the American Library Assn. had found that the library group and the NRA 
"supplied the most accurate information" of all lobbying organizations. In 
truth, the compliment appeared in a Library Journal gossip column, citing only 
the opinion of "a highly placed library source in Washington, D.C." GraceAnne 
DeCandido, who wrote the item, said it was based on "dinner-table conversation" 
with a government bureaucrat. "To have the NRA use that in support of their 
policies is beyond ludicrous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A Prayer for Arms 
</P>
<P>
AT THE NRA's national convention in April, more than 16,000 people roamed 
across 160,000 square feet of exhibits at St. Louis' convention center. They 
shouldered pea-green SIG assault rifles. They clicked the triggers of 
super-light Glock 17 pistols. They marveled at new laser targeting devices that 
can project a red beam hundreds of feet, from gun to bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
And then, during a break, 1,000 NRA activists filed into a cavernous hall where 
Merrill L. (Pete) Petoskey, a wildlife biologist from Lewiston, Mich., 
delivered the opening prayer at the NRA's 118th annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear God, Creator of all ... 
</P>
<P>
 "Please give us the direction to make (gun-control advocates) understand that 
the actions of criminals, who should be confined, should not be dramatized into 
legislation that will impose on the rights of millions of law-abiding citizens 
to own and bear arms for lawful pursuits of recreation and self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please help and guide the leaders of the National Rifle Association and of 
this nation to preserve and strengthen this freedom and this right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amen." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the meeting, NRA President Foss acknowledged that the beleaguered 
group could, indeed, use more help. He called on the nation's 70 million gun 
owners "to get off their duffs if they want to keep their guns." The news 
media, the grizzled hero of two wars said, "have a million reasons for us not 
to have guns. But look at what happened in Germany when ol' Hitler did a good 
job in disarming the nation. If people are armed, it keeps the bad actors off 
the scene." 
</P>
<P>
"With your help," chimed in Wayne R. LaPierre Jr., head of the NRA's lobbying, 
"we will protect your basic God-given right to defend yourself and to own 
firearms in this country." 
</P>
<P>
At the NRA's annual banquet that night, actor Charlton Heston evoked his famous 
movie image of Moses on the mountaintop as he provided the group with an 
inspirational boost. 
</P>
<P>
As the main speaker, Heston noted that he keeps beside his bed a .45-caliber 
service revolver that he brought back from World War II. "That's a 
semiautomatic weapon, and I do not plan to surrender it," he proclaimed, 
banging the lectern. Then, accepting an ornate flintlock rifle from the NRA for 
his years of support, Heston hoisted it above his head as if it were a stone 
tablet. Intoning the punch line of a defiant pro-gun slogan, he suggested that 
nobody was going to take this weapon from him unless it was pried "from my 
cold, dead hands!" 
</P>
<P>
The 1,200 diners leaped up, roaring. For an army of crusaders besieged, it was 
just the rousing send-off needed for the tough battles ahead.

  WHY I NO LONGER VOTE THE NRA LINE  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FOR 16 years in Congress, I have been a 100 percenter in eyes of the National
Rifle Association leadership. For the past two decades, the entire Oregon
House delegation, regardless of party, has voted with the NRA right down the
line. For a long time, it seemed like the right thing to do.;    It doesn't
any more.  
</P>
<P>
But out West, politicians are still expected to support NRA leadership. The
conventional wisdom still is: If you cross the gun lobby, they'll have a
silver bullet waiting for you at the next election.;    I'm betting that those
days are over. I will vote for the Brady Bill - the seven-day waiting period
for persons wanting to buy handguns - and for restrictions on the sale and
domestic manufacture of assault weapons.;    Don't misunderstand: The NRA has
a strong presence throughout my state. Oregon probably has a lot more pickups
with gun racks than Volvos with ski racks. A landmark I'll never forget in
Newberg, Ore., was a gun store named "Toys for Big Boys." The NRA in Oregon is
62,000 members strong, and there are about 150 gun clubs in the state.;     I
USED to tell myself that gun control isn't crime control and - comforted by
that thought - I let my 100 percent NRA rating keep arguments about guns from
consuming the time I felt I needed for the issues I came to Congress to
advance: jobs, education, family security and social justice.;    What has
been happening in our streets has changed my mind dramatically. Handguns alone
have killed about 50,000 people in the United States since the Brady Bill was
last considered by Congress. Oregonians in "safe" neighborhoods face gun
violence unthinkable when I was first elected to Congress in 1974.;    Youth
gangs with bulging arsenals cruise up and down Interstate 5 on the West Coast
to ply their drug trade in our cities. Just a few weeks ago, a gang knocked
over a gun shop in rural Hood River to steal sophisticated firearms, including
assault weapons, apparently intended for sale on the black market. One youth
was shot to death during the crime.;    The '80s shattered Oregonians' dearly
held image of their state as an island in a sea of national crime and
violence. When a gunman with a long criminal history blew away five children
in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard two years ago, Oregonians were appalled to
discover he'd bought his assault rifle in Sandy, Ore. Even Oregon gun
lobbyists privately conceded our state's problems with criminal and negligent
use of firearms.;     AS CRIME got worse, I discovered what an ideological
straitjacket that NRA seal of approval can be. If New Jersey's mandatory
background check for handgun purchases has caught 10,000 convicted felons
trying to buy handguns, how could I honestly tell myself that gun control
isn't crime control?;    If, as the nation just learned last week, more
teen-age boys now die from gunshot wounds than from all natural causes
combined, how could I continue to separate neatly the increasing carnage in
communities from "my issues" of jobs, education, social justice and family
security? I couldn't.;    A couple of years ago, after listening to my own
anti-gun-control spiel one time too many, I realized how threadbare it
sounded. I started paying closer attention to the arguments on both sides of
the Brady Bill and assault weapon curbs.;    I lent an ear to some unexpected
gun control advocates: a janitor who accosted me angrily after a teachers'
meeting in Beaverton; Newberg's police chief, who is also an NRA member; and
my own wife, who grew up - as I did - in rural Redmond, where some are fond
of saying you learn to shoot before you learn to read.;    I used to think I
listened; now I've heard. What I've heard convinces me that the conventional
wisdom about the NRA's clout is hopelessly out of touch - and that the
leaders of the NRA are out of touch too. Most of the people I represent are
now more concerned about gun violence than they are about whatever
inconvenience may be caused by a seven-day waiting period, which can prevent
felons, drug addicts and the mentally disturbed from buying handguns.;    The
Brady bill and assault weapon curbs aren't panaceas for crime, but evidence at
the state level shows they will help.;     MY CONSTITUENTS want policies that
reduce violent crime, regardless of whether they are labeled "gun control."
The gun lobby guarantees its political irrelevance by denying that. By
opposing moderate measures like the Brady Bill - which public opinion
research shows 87 percent of gun owners favor - the leadership of the NRA has
made its congressional supporters patsies in a game of lethal consequences.;  
This time, the gun lobby has overplayed its hand. Frankly, I'm sick of it,
and I'm sick of gun violence.;    After too long at the table, I'm ready to do
what I can to bust up the game.

<P>
After all the lobbying, hand-wringing and Ronald Reagan's
endorsement of the Brady gun-control bill, a ditty says it
all:
Cow kicked Nellie in the barn
Didn't do her any good, didn't do her any harm.
</P>
<P>
Gun-control laws can never substitute for the hard work of
apprehending and convicting criminals. Still, the Brady bill
is a small price to pay if Congress also agrees to the
administration's crime bill.
</P>
<P>
No one believes that this gun bill would have a measurable
effect on violent crime, or even that it would have stopped
John Hinkley from buying the gun he used five months later to
shoot Mr. Reagan and James Brady. There would be a seven-day
waiting period before any gun dealer sells a handgun to a
customer. During that week, state law-enforcement officials
can (but wouldn't have to) investigate whether the purchaser
is a felon or has spent time in a mental institution. The gun
could be sold at the end of the week unless the police find
the evidence to stop the sale.
</P>
<P>
The first problem is that there is no way of knowing who
is a felon, much less a mental patient. There is no computer
list of the criminal records from the states. Nine states do
not even require that courts report the final disposition of
felony cases. At the federal level, the FBI doesn't have
records showing the final results in half of its arrests. The
Brady bill would not create any national record of people who
cannot buy handguns. With no list for gun dealers to consult,
the bill's effectiveness dims.
</P>
<P>
There is also something breathtaking in the claim that
crime can be stopped by regulating gun dealers. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh calls this the "17% solution." Fewer
than one-in-five handguns acquired by felons are bought from
gun dealers. There is an active gun market, including
rent-a-gun operations in some public-housing projects. Making
it harder to buy from legitimate dealers will boost street
sales.
</P>
<P>
Gun control has become the $600 toilet seat of the crime
debate. Yes, it would be good to keep firearms out of the
hands of felons and the mentally incompetent. But all the
talk about gun control has prevented the serious discussion
on crime this country desperately needs to have.
</P>
<P>
For example, why don't we have records of felons? Part of
the answer is to imagine how long it would take an ACLU
affiliate somewhere to file a lawsuit alleging that the
rights of felons or certifiably dangerous mental patients
would be violated by a national registry.
</P>
<P>
As with the drug problem, the only solution to crimes with
guns is on the demand side. Americans own perhaps 150 million
firearms; that is more guns than cars. Even if we somehow
banned sales of all weapons from butter knives to imported
semi-automatics, the current supply is more than adequate for
street crimes.
</P>
<P>
This is why a Brady bill, which won't work but which also
won't cause much harm, would be a reasonable trade-off for
the Bush crime bill. Under the administration's bill,
criminals, especially ones who use firearms, would face more
certain punishment. The bill would finally limit the endless
appeals from death-penalty convictions and create new death
penalties for drug-related killings.
</P>
<P>
Our favorite provision would offer more effective gun
control than the Brady bill. This is Mr. Thornburgh's
"inclusionary rule" to replace the exclusionary rule's absurd
result that a criminal goes free because a constable
blundered. The jury would still get to see the evidence of
the gun and convict the criminal even where evidence of a
firearm is obtained under a faulty search warrant or some
other technical problem. Instead of keeping the truth from
jurors, the evidence would be allowed. But to encourage
lawful searches, the Justice Department would also set up a
system to pay compensation to people who are wrongly searched
and to discipline erring officers directly.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30 years, everything from "Miranda"
censoring of confessions to activist judges declaring that
jails are "too crowded" has created a reign of lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
The chances of a crime leading to an arrest, conviction and
serious prison term are well under one-in-100 in many parts
of the country. We may have more people in jail than ever
before, but it is still true that a rational criminal can
calculate the odds that crime does pay.
</P>
<P>
Gun-control proposals only hide the deeper problem that
the country still lacks the will to punish criminals. Our
idea of real gun and crime control starts with freeing the
law-enforcement system from the many procedural hurdles that
deter it from providing law, order and justice.
