Thousands Mark Total Eclipse With Prayers, Dancing and
Drum-Beating
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>GENERAL SANTOS CITY, Philippines (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of peole
prayed, cheered, danced, beat drums and observed other traditions
today as a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of
Indonesia and the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The sun was blacked out by the shadow of the moon for up to four
minutes along a 108-mile swath that moved from the Indian Ocean
across Indonesia and the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
A partial eclipse was visible across a wide area of Asia as far
west as India _ including Southeast Asia, China, Japan and New
Guinea as well as parts of Australia and the Pacific islands.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said the eclipse would end at sunset in the Gulf of
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
Clouds obscured the solar spectacular in Jakarta, Indonesia,
Hong Kong and in the eastern Mindanao city of Davao, where
thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe the
eclipse.
</P>
<P>
But it was visible for about 3 minutes in this city about 650
miles southeast of Manila despite early scattered clouds. President
Corazon Aquino flew in to witness the event.
</P>
<P>
Richard Fisher of the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder,
Colo., said that despite scattered clouds, scientists were
confident they had taken useful pictures of the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Wilson Sinambela of the National Institute of
Aeronautics said a total eclipse was observed in several parts of
the country, including by about 1,000 tourists in the South Sumatra
capital Palembang.
</P>
<P>
He said thousands of Indonesians prayed and beat drums to herald
the start of the eclipse, which began in southwestern Sumatra
before heading on to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In Kuala Lumpur, where a partial eclipse blocked out about 80
percent of the sun, some Malaysian Hindus visited temples to pray
for protection against harm during the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
In Kurukshetra, India, an estimated 1 million pilgrims dipped
into the waters of the sacred Sannihit and Brahmsarover tanks after
a public address system announced the start of the eclipse. Hymns
were chanted and conch shells blown during the ceremony about 90
miles north of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Clouds blocked the first moments of the eclipse in General
Santos City. But the cloud cover broke, setting off wild cheering
among the thousands who watched the phenomenon in a scorching
tropical heat.
</P>
<P>
Street lights switched on, and members of the Naragcas tribe, in
the city for a festival, danced in the streets to the beat of drums.
</P>
<P>
In Baguio City, 130 miles north of Manila, pregnant women of the
local Ilocano community rinsed their hair during the eclipse with
water dripped from burned rice straws in a traditional ritual.
</P>
<P>
According to local superstition, babies conceived during or
shortly before an eclipse will be deformed unless their mothers
practice the ritual.
</P>
<P>
Many other Filipinos marked the eclipse by going to church. The
Philippines is Asia's only predominately Christian country.
``This phenomenon is a clear reminder from God for mankind to
repent its sins,'' said Theresa Teopengco, a government employee.
</P>
<P>
Officials said about 20,000 tourists and scientists from around
the world had come to the southern Philippines to watch the
eclipse, the last one expected here for at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said the area afforded the best opportunity to
witness and study the eclipse because skies are usually clear this
time of year.
</P>
<P>
But in Davao City, 60 miles to the northeast, morning clouds
sent hundreds scurrying to the airport for flights to General
Santos.
</P>
<P>
Church bells in Davao tolled while police and civilians set off
firecrackers and fired weapons in the air to mark the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, thousands turned out under clear skies to see the
partial eclipse that blocked about 75 percent of the sun's surface
at its height.
</P>
<P>
Police said four people were injured when a passenger bus
collided with a jeep during the eclipse.
``The drivers were probably looking skyward when the accident
occurred,'' said policeman Ricardo Manansala. ``It's impossible to
gaze at the sky and drive a vehicle at the same time.''
Solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the
Earth and the sun. The Chinese first recorded a total solar eclipse
in 2137 B.C., regarding them as signs of a battle to death between
the sun and the dragon.

Pilgrims Bathe In Sacred Rivers During Solar Eclipse
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>KURUKSHETRA, India (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Hindu
pilgrims plunged into sacred rivers and pools during a solar
eclipse Sunday, believing they would be freed of sin and attain
salvation. Authorities said a 12-year-old boy drowned.
</P>
<P>
As the moon partially passed between the Earth and sun,
worshipers chanted hymns and blew conch shells. About 3,000 naked
holy men waded into the giant sacred pools of Sannihit and
Brahmsarovar, followed in turns by an estimated 500,000 men and
women, some clothed, others naked.
</P>
<P>
Many carried coconuts, auspicious symbols for Hindus, and set
them in the water. Others gave alms to beggars or Hindu priests,
who offered prayers to the sun. There is an ancient belief that the
sun is in pain during an eclipse and prayers must be offered for
its relief.
</P>
<P>
The scene was repeated, in smaller numbers, at rivers and pools
across India.
</P>
<P>
An epic Hindu poem, the ``Mahabharata,'' promises salvation to
those who bathe or give alms at Kurukshetra during a solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
Kurukshetra's larger pool, Brahmasarovar, has a two-mile
perimeter. Sannihit's perimeter is about half that size. The pools
can accomodate 125,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of police stood guard and directed traffic in the town
of 25,000 people about 90 miles north of New Delhi. Divers and
lifeguards kept watch over the bathers but could not save the
12-year-old boy from drowning, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse, which lasted about 90 minutes, was the third in the
past year. The others occurred on March 18 and Sept. 13, 1987.
</P>
<P>
According to Hindu legend, Kurukshetra was created by the Hindu
god Lord Brahma and was the scene of an ancient battle in which
Lord Vishnu, the protector of the Hindu diety, pleaded for
righteousness.

A partial solar eclipse visible across
western North America bored scientists but thrilled crowds that were
able to see it despite clouds covering parts of the region.
``It's fabulous to know this is actually taking place. It's very
fascinating,'' said Edie Lurie, an employee at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where dozens used solar
telescopes to watch the moon eclipse 37 percent of the sun at 9:50
a.m. PST Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial
eclipse, it was possible to see mountains on the edge of the moon
silhouetted against the sun. Also visible were gas jets on the sun's
surface and a giant group of sunspots that on Monday and Tuesday
produced major solar flares _ eruptions of heat and radiation _
including the largest since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Clouds over downtown Salt Lake City dashed Hansen Planetarium's
plans to set up telescopes to watch the moon block 36 percent of the
sun at 11:10 a.m. MST.
``It's a bummer, but that's the way it goes,'' planetarium
spokesman Patrick Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a
diagonal line stretching roughly from Mazatlan, Mexico, northeast to
Dallas and Chicago. Views were best farther west and north.
</P>
<P>
In sunny Los Angeles, 600 schoolchildren and at least 400 other
people watched the eclipse at Griffith Observatory through
telescopes and other devices equipped with filters to prevent eye
injury.
``There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,''
observatory Director Ed Krupp said.
</P>
<P>
Most astronomers were unimpressed, saying they were waiting for a
total solar eclipse that will sweep across Hawaii, the Pacific
Ocean, lower Baja California in Mexico, Central America, Colombia
and Brazil on July 11, 1991.
``You can see a partial eclipse every three or four years,'' said
Caltech astrophysicist Ken Libbrecht. ``They're not that exciting. A
total eclipse is exciting.''
In Tucson, dozens of citizens peered through telescopes on the
University of Arizona mall to see the moon eclipse 23 percent of the
sun at 10:55 a.m. MST, but 90 solar scientists stayed inside,
attending a five-day conference titled ``The Sun in Time.''
``That's partly my fault,'' said conference co-organizer Mark
Giampapa, an astronomer at the National Solar Observatory. ``I
should have listed it in the program: `Partial eclipse, presented by
God.'''
In Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the
sun at 9:13 a.m. AST, the eclipse was watched by 26 students from
Bartlett High School, several people wearing welders helmets as
filters and Providence Hospital workers who ended a staff meeting
early to see the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
Clouds parted long enough to allow a glimpse of the eclipse for
100 people outside the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in
often rainy Portland.
``Typical Oregon astronomy,'' said amateur astronomer Dan Dunn.
``You always have to deal with the clouds.''
Scientists had warned against staring at the sun directly or
through inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic
film or filters.

partial eclipse.

^Total Eclipse of Moon May be Seen by More Than a Billion
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total lunar eclipse visible from five
continents occurs after sunset Wednesday when the full moon orbits
into the shadow of the Earth and slowly turns from a bright silver
into a copper or orange disk.
</P>
<P>
More than a billion people will have a chance to watch as the
moon appears to be slowly nibbled away, changing from the normal
bright reflected light of a full moon into the colorful glow of
eclipse.
</P>
<P>
The celestial show starts at 8:23 p.m. EDT over the United
States and will end about 5{ hours later. The eastern United States
will get the best viewing and Alaska will miss the eclipse
altogether.
</P>
<P>
Visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and western
parts of the country because of the difference in sunset and
moonrise. In Los Angeles, for instance, the eclipse will have
started before the sun has set or the moon has risen. By the time
the sky has darkened completely in California, the moon will
already be in the deepest part of its eclipse. For Seattle, the
moon will still be below the horizon at mid-eclipse, but will rise
during the totality phase.
</P>
<P>
Clouds, of course, could ruin the viewing at any location.
</P>
<P>
With clear skies, though, some phase of the celestial spectacle
should be visible to observers in North and South America, western
Europe and Africa, and the Antarctic. Sailors at sea in the
Atlantic and in the eastern Pacific Ocean also will be able to see
part of the eclipse, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow
created by the Earth blocking the sun's light. The moon, in its
orbit of the Earth, usually passes above or below this shadowline,
but every few years it follows a path that puts it completely in
shade for a time. When the whole moon passes through the shadow, it
is called a total eclipse.
</P>
<P>
The last total lunar eclipse visible over most of North America
occurred in December 1982, and the next one is not until December
1992.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers are forecasting that Wednesday's eclipse may be a
bright one.
</P>
<P>
The moon can appear during an eclipse to be a bright coppery red
if there is clear, clean air between the lunar surface and the
observer on Earth. If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon will
diminish to an orange color or perhaps even fade from view
altogether.
</P>
<P>
Volcanic eruptions historically have dimmed eclipse viewing by
dumping tons of dust into the atmosphere. But astronomers say
enough time has passed since the last major volcanic eruption that
most dust has settled.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse starts when the moon enters what is called the
penumbra. This outer fringe of the Earth's shadow will show up on
the moon as a grayish shading. After about half an hour, the moon
will edge into the umbra, the dark, central part of the shadow.
</P>
<P>
Total eclipse, when all of the moon is covered by the umbra, will
begin at about 10:20 p.m. EDT and last for one hour, 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
When the moon leaves the umbra, the events will occur in reverse
order. The eclipse ends about 1:53 a.m. EDT when the moon edges out
of the shadow altogether.
</P>
<P>
While a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth blocks sunlight from
the moon, a solar eclipse is caused when the moon blocks sunlight
from the Earth.
</P>
<P>
To experts, a solar eclipse is more interesting because it
permits unique measurements of the sun.
``Solar eclipses attract a lot of scientific attention,'' said
John Bangert, a U.S. Naval Observatory astronomer in Washington.
``A lunar eclipse is just a good show.''
Here is when the various phases of the eclipse will occur. All
times are Eastern daylight.
</P>
<P>
Moon enters penumbra: 8:23 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Moon enters umbra: 9:21 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Moon enters totality: 10:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Middle of Eclipse: 11:08 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Moon leaves totality: 11:56 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Moon leaves umbra: 12:56 a.m., Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moon leaves penumbra: 1:53 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Because of the differences in sunset and moonrise times, viewing
will start at different eclipse phases in the western parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Here are times for the local events that affect eclipse viewing.
</P>
<P>
The first hour is for local sunset and the second is for local
moonrise. The best viewing will follow twilight which ends about 25
minutes after sunset. Local time zones apply in all cases:
Baltimore: Sunset at 8 p.m. Moonrise at 7:53 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Boston: 7:43 p.m. and 7:36 p.m.

Weather Could Cloud Eclipse Spectacle for Finns
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to
mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping
to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun.
</P>
<P>
The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening,
when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weather
with a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern town of Joensuu, a television news broadcast late
Saturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzle
falling.
</P>
<P>
The solar eclipse in Finland starts at 4:03 a.m. Sunday (9:03
p.m. EDT Saturday). At that time, the moon will begin gradually
moving between the Earth and the sun.
</P>
<P>
The total eclipse begins at 4:52 a.m. in Helsinki and will last
83 seconds. After the total phase of the eclipse, the moon will
move away, uncovering more and more of the sun. The eclipse ends at
5:45 a.m. in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 people _ including 3,000 foreigners _ have
converged on Joensuu, about 50 miles from the Soviet border. There
conditions there are considered especially good for viewing the
eclipse _ weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after
sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon. At
Joensuu, 310 miles northeast of Helsinki, the sun will be 5 degrees
above the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers.
</P>
<P>
The sun rises unusually early during summer in the extreme
northern latitudes where Finland is located. The sun comes up
unusually late during winter.
</P>
<P>
Ten months ago, Joensuu hired an ``eclipse secretary'' to handle
arrangements for the expected influx of visitors.
</P>
<P>
But that official, Marjut Cadia, said she had underestimated the
interest in the event.
``We completely sold out the 10,000 special eyeglasses we made
for this event, and our extra stock is finished too,'' she said in
a television interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, newspapers, television and radio have been
full of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice for
spectators not to stare directly into the sun.
</P>
<P>
Some eclipse viewers won't have to worry about the clouds,
because they will be above them. Finnair, the national airline, has
arranged a dozen special flights for eclipse watchers, and private
companies with small planes will provide more.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide from
the northern Baltic Sea and southeast Finland, across the Kola
Peninsula and northeast Soviet Union, to the Aleutian Islands near
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse,
including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun.
</P>
<P>
However, scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than in
longer eclipses, such as the seven-minute eclipse seen from
northern Kenya on June 30, 1973.
</P>
<P>
Seppo Linnaluoto of the Ursa Astronomical Association said the
best place for observations of this eclipse will be the northeast
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The last total eclipse to be seen in Finland occurred in 1945.

  SKY-WATCHERS CHASING A SHADOW
HAWAIIAN, MEXICAN ECLIPSE ZONES BRACE FOR
ASTRONOMICAL CROWDS  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the extravagant plans inspired by this week's solar eclipse, none beats
the Earth Evacuation Project.;    Participants in Mexico believe the total
eclipse, which will send a shadow racing from Hawaii to Brazil as the moon
crosses directly in front of the sun, will cause volcanic eruptions, signaling
Earthlings to start bailing out on spaceships to the fourth dimension,
according to Intergalactic Guardian command leader "Angel," who declined to
give a last name.  
</P>
<P>
While Angel and his followers meditate to prepare for their journey, French
New Age musician Jean-Michel Jarre is coordinating an elaborate
sound-and-light show to play at the foot of the pyramids in Teotihuacan, north
of the capital.;    Also on E-day, July 11, crowded cruise ships will linger
off Mexico's Pacific Coast, and thousands of U.S. tourists will drive south
into Baja California, which, usually boasting clear skies, is being billed as
the world's most promising site from which to view nature's own light show.;  
Eclipse fans from Japan to New York to the Netherlands are expected in
droves, but Californians - because of their proximity to Baja and propensity
for mystical phenomena - should be conspicuous.;    However, the chic hot
spot for eclipse watchers won't be Mexico, but the big island of Hawaii, where
the 18,000 tourists who would be there anyway to enjoy the sunshine will be
joined by an additional 30,000 or more coming to watch the sun go out for four
minutes.;    Even more people might be there for the show, but for the lack of
seats on flights to the island. Most visitors will be funneled in through the
relatively small airport at Kailua.;    Airlines are adding scores of flights
to ferry thousands of people from neighboring islands in the hours just before
the eclipse.;    Car rental companies have shipped in 3,000 or so extra cars.;
More than one caller from the mainland has asked the visitors' bureau
whether the island is in danger of tipping over under the tourists' weight.;  
But Mexico will host the biggest share of travelers, partly because of its
easy access from the United States and partly since the eclipse will last
longest here: up to seven minutes, which is three more minutes than the
maximum length in Hawaii. This will also be the longest-lasting total eclipse
until 2132, according to Alan Dyer, an associate editor at Astronomy
magazine.;    The midday eclipse will consist of a 160-mile wide lunar shadow
speeding at up to 5,000 miles per hour along the Earth's surface.;    While
many Mexicans are looking forward to the event, some are quietly taking
precautions. In pre-Colombian times, eclipses were viewed as bad omens by the
sun-worshiping Aztecs.;    In the capital's Sonora market, specializing in
magic, vendors have stocked up on garlic bulbs tied with red ribbon, which
they hawk as protection from "the bad vibrations of the eclipse." A thriving
trade is also taking place in magnets, for those with low blood pressure to
carry in their pockets on July 11, and old copper coins for pregnant women to
place as charms in their belly buttons.;    As in Hawaii, Mexico could
probably use some otherworldly intervention to cope with the scores of
thousands of tourists who have already started arriving.;    In the southern
half of the Baja Peninsula, some hotels have had rooms reserved for more than
a year. All are now booked up, and authorities fear competition at campsites.;
"We're worried that Californians will drive down on the spur of the moment,
without taking water or fuel," said Marivi Lerdo, who promotes tourism to
Mexico in New York.;    Although Hawaii's isolation will limit the size of the
crowds, locals are still predicting problems. "By God, there's just one road
on this island," a circle route that often narrows to two lanes, one shop
owner said. "It's going to be total insanity.";    "We're worrying that we
won't have enough alcohol and food on the island," said the manager of a local
restaurant and disco called The Eclipse, named by coincidence 10 years ago.;  
While authorities fret over infrastructure capacity, many Californians are
preparing to revel in a New Age wonderland.;    "These are people who have
never, ever, missed a single episode of 'Star Trek,' " said Ken Stewart, who
is planning to lead a caravan of 50 enthusiasts from San Diego to Cabo San
Lucas, on the south tip of Baja.;    Mexico's government is heavily involved
in eclipse planning, having formed an Intersecretarial Commission for the
Eclipse, which, among other things, is supposed to oversee production of as
many as 60 million protective lenses. Newspapers here are carrying frequent
reminders not to stare directly at the sun.;    During the eclipse, the mystic
and the scientific will not be far apart.;    At six observatories atop
Hawaii's Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that is the highest peak in the Pacific,
solar researchers will turn their telescopes on the sun's outer atmosphere as
the moon covers the rest of the star.;    Twenty miles downhill, at The
Crystal Grotto in Honomu, Wendy Gilliam is selling pouches of three stones
called corona crystals and advising people to "expose them to the energy"
during the eclipse. "As the moon passes over the sun, there are certain power
vortexes here that are going to be opened up and awakened," she said.; DON'T
</P>
<P>
LOOK DIRECTLY AT IT; (box) If you want to watch the moon's progress across the
sun: Don't look at it. Staring at the sun during a partial eclipse could
quickly - without your feeling a thing - burn into your retina a permanent
image of the crescent sun, causing severe and permanent vision loss.;    (box)
It's safest to watch the eclipse indirectly by projecting the sun's image
through a pinhole and onto a sheet of white paper.;    (box) Other safe
methods: (check) Pieces of arc-welders' glass labeled  14 and available at
welding supply stores. Most welders' goggles are not suitable protection.
(check) Two or three layers of Mylar plastic heavily coated with aluminum.

Shortly before 10:30 this morning California time, nature turned off the sun's
light switch and total darkness over Hawaii signaled the beginning of the "The
Eclipse of the Millennium.";    "Oh, my God," exclaimed one spectator after
another at a mountaintop observatory atop Mauna Kea as the sky went blank.

"That's the best eclipse I've ever seen. That is truly spectacular," said
Don Hall, director of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy.;    More than 40
million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing
ring was visible in the western Americas. Shadows stretched from west to east,
as the eclipse turned morning into a night along a 160-mile-wide swath from
Hawaii to Baja to Mexico City to Calamar, Colombia - the only region where
the eclipse made the Earth totally dark.;    In Hawaii, the volcano Mauna Loa
stunned visiting astronomers by producing a dazzling show of steam and glowing
lava at the height of the eclipse. Local geologists, though, indicated the
activity was probably routine.;    In the Bay Area, more than half the sun was
covered when the eclipse peaked at 11:20 a.m. The world will not see such a
long-lasting eclipse for another 151 years.;    Few people who saw it today
will forget "The Big One.";    "It looks neat. It looks like someone took a
bite out of an apple," said Matthew Mauranoh, 8, of Mountain View, who peered
through a homemade black box at the Foothill Observatory.;    The view was
diminished for many in Hawaii and Mexico, where low cloud cover obscured the
celestial display.;    As totality arrived at sea level on the Big Island, the
sun was hidden in some places by a cloud layer. At the astronomy observatory
at the top of 13,800-foot Mauna Kea, high cirrus clouds thwarted three of the
10 scientific experiments.;    But scientists were still struck by the sight
of two plumes of flame extending out 100,000 miles from the sun, one directly
on the top of the sun and one at the bottom. Both were colored bright fuchsia.

Another impressive feature was that the sun's corona, which stretched out for
a million miles around the sun, was not symmetrical, but jagged, with spikes
and valleys.;    The eclipse ended in a little more than six minutes with a
dazzling "diamond ring" effect on the rim as the first rays of sun emerged
from behind the moon.;    It still got dark below the mountain, but the clouds
disappointed about 500 people gathered on the driving range at the Mauna Lani
resort in south Kohala. Because of the clouds, most were unable to see the
stages of the eclipse until it got totally dark. Spectators' hopes had fallen
and risen in the previous hour as the clouds came and went.;    "I came
especially for this, and hope we get to see it," said Margaret MacLeod, a
mathematics and science teacher from Manhattan Beach shortly before the
eclipse in Hawaii. "If we don't get to see it, I may have to go to Iraq for
the next one.";    In the Bay Area, mostly sunny skies made eclipse-watching a
treat, except along the coast, where it was obscured by fog.;    Parks,
parking lots, shopping centers, back yards and planetariums became
Eclipsefests as the peak approached.;    More than a hundred sun gazers showed
up at the Branham Lane Park in South San Jose with almost as many gizmos to
help them spot sunspots and watch the moon cross the sun.;    There were funny
Mylar glasses, big pinhole projectors, small pinhole projectors, welder's
glass, welder's masks, binoculars projecting images onto cardboard and
telescopes.;    None was as impressive as Ralph Reeves' interference
birefrigent hydrogen alpha filter telescope. All most of us need to know is
that it takes electricity (provided by a gas generator) to run. And that you
can take pictures of the eclipse through it. That is, if you have film.;    "I
didn't bring any film with me," said Reeves, a retired Lockheed instrument
builder. "Isn't that awful?";    At the Children's Discovery Museum in
downtown San Jose, hundreds of youngsters and adults made cardboard
telescopes, which projected the eclipse on white cards through a needle hole
opening. Using mirrors, the eclipse also was projected on the exterior walls
of the lavender-colored museum.;    "We wanted to make little theaters for all
of the kids to see the eclipse without burning their eyes," said Paul
Stonecipher, a discovery museum staff guide.;    For nearly a week now, Hawaii
has been turned into an eclipse theme park. More than 500 astronomers and tens
of thousands of amateurs flocked to the islands to sell nearly everything
under the sun.;    Sun-minded entrepreneurs hawked eclipse T-shirts (60
different designs), hats, posters and cookies. There was even an eclipse
haircut and, of course, an eclipse drink at the Eclipse restaurant in
Kailua-Kona.;    "Everything is selling pretty well except for the eclipse
Frisbees. Nobody wants eclipse Frisbees," said "Wild Bill" Lawrence, who
helped out at Moonshadows, one of many small shops set up to sell eclipse
mementos.;    One church offered a nightly eclipse service. Another invited
visitors to "come worship with the sun.";    On the commercial strip in Kona,
the Big Island's equivalent of Fisherman's Wharf, the eclipse attracted a
human mass equivalent to the flock that attends the island's annual Iron Man
Triathalon.;    "Most of the scientists who are serious about it are on the
north part of the island," Mary Beth Black, a Kona health food store owner,
told Bay Area radio listeners. "The people here for the fun of it are here in
Kona.";    In Mexico City, the eclipse melded with the city's famed smog. The
Anthropology Museum held a ritual depicting the moon attempting to eat the
sun. Guatemalan Indian villagers, who worry during eclipses that the sun will
disappear forever, rang church bells and banged pots and pans to resurrect it.
