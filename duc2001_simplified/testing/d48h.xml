Scientist Rebuts Periodic Volcano Theory
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A government scientist says his detailed new
analysis disproves the theory that volcanoes are more likely to
erupt at certain times of the year.
</P>
<P>
Historically, volcanoes have erupted slightly more often in some
months than others, leading to disputes over whether the variation
was enough to constitute a periodic pattern.
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Stothers concluded that it isn't in a report in the
May issue of Geophysical Research Letters, published by the
American Geophysical Union.
</P>
<P>
Stothers, of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., compared the dates
of recorded strong volcanic eruptions between 1500 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
During that time 265 eruptions were recorded in the first half
of each calendar year and 236 in the last six months, a difference
Stothers said is not statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
Breaking down the eruptions by month and area, Stothers did find
some clustering, but this was explainable, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
For example, nearly all eruptions south of 50 degrees south
latitude occurred between November and April.
</P>
<P>
This is almost certainly because that is summer in that part of
the world, the time of year the nearly uninhabited region is most
often visited by outsiders who would record eruptions, Stothers
said.
</P>
<P>
No similar pattern was seen in the far north, where residents
are always present to notice eruptions.
</P>
<P>
Stother's monthly analysis found a peak average of 52 eruptions
in February between the years 1500 and 1980 and a minimum of 36
eruptions in the months of April and December during that period.
</P>
<P>
The average number of eruptions in other months fell in between
those two, a variation within the range that statisticians would
expect to occur in a random sample.
</P>
<P>
Stother's analysis rebuts several studies done in the late 1800s
and early in this century that indicated a seasonality to volcanic
eruptions.
</P>
<P>
At least one 1917 report speculated that eruptions would cluster
around the equinoxes in the spring and fall as a result of changes
in the angle of the sun.
</P>
<P>
Periodic springtime eruptions of some volcanoes have been
associated with melting snow seeping into the ground and reacting
with molton lava below the ground, scientists have suggested.
</P>
<P>
But seasonality occurring at individual volcanoes disappears
when they are averaged in with many others around the world,
according to Stother's analysis.

Researchers Say Volcanic Dust May Not Cool Climate
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dust plumes spewed out by volcanoes, long
thought to cool the climate, may well have little weather effect, a
new study contends.
``Previous suggestions of large cooling during the first few
months after volcanic events appear to be unwarranted,''
researchers Clifford F. Mass and David A. Portman say in the June
issue of the Journal of Climate, published by the American
Meteorological Society.
</P>
<P>
Volcanic eruptions have often been blamed for cooling of the
climate in the past, based on the theory that the dust they inject
into the atmosphere would block sunlight and reduce the normal
warming of the land and sea surface.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the cold weather in 1816, known to historians as ``the
year without a summer,'' has been widely blamed on a series of
volcanic eruptions that occurred in various parts of the world
between 1812 and 1815.
</P>
<P>
In their study, Portman and Mass said prior analyses may have
been confused by temperature changes that involve a periodic
warming and cooling of sea and air temperatures, a pattern known as
the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
</P>
<P>
After subtracting those effects from the historical records,
they concluded that ``only the largest eruptions are suggested in
the climatic record and that a modest cooling is observed for one
to two years after these large events.''
They defined modest cooling as about one-tenth to two-tenths of
a degree Celsius in average temperatures. That would amount to 0.2
to 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
The authors found little hint of any effect on air pressure or
rain or snowfall.
</P>
<P>
Considering that eruptions throwing dust into the air should
interfere with radiation from the sun, they asked themselves: ``Why
is the volcanic effect on surface climate so small?''
The answer, they concluded, amounts to an altered form of the
greenhouse effect _ the currently widely discussed threatened
heating of the planet.
``Volcanic stratospheric aerosols can drastically reduce the
direct solar beam,'' they concluded, an effect which should lower
the temperature by reducing the warming from the sun.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time these chemicals and dust also block
infrared rediation from the ground and ocean what would normally be
radiated back into space, cooling the planet.
</P>
<P>
Because volcanic clouds often shade only a small portion of the
surface and have only a negligible net effect on the radiation
balance, they result in little measurable climate change, concluded
Mass, of the University of Washington in Seattle, and Portman of
Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
Records which seem to indicate cooling following eruptions could
reflect ordinary variations in climate, they conclude. In fact, a
more detailed analysis of the records indicates that in some cases
gradual cooling reported following eruptions had actually begun
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
As for 1816, Mass and Portman conclude that it was an unusually
cold summer in North America and parts of Europe, but the degree of
cooling was not unprecedented. The cold year could have resulted
from consistent wind patterns bringing arctic air south, they said.
</P>
<P>
The greenhouse effect which has become a source of concern in
recent years results from an accumulation of carbon dioxide and
other gases in the atmosphere, largely a result of burning fossil
fuels and other industrial processes.
</P>
<P>
Like volcanic dust, these gases trap the earth's heat,
preventing it from radiating out into space and cooling the planet.
</P>
<P>
But unlike the volcanic dust, the greenhouse gases do not balance
things by blocking incoming sunlight.

Stress-related Illnesses Spreading Among People, Pets Near Volcano
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors Wednesday reported a growing number of
stress-related illnesses among people in a resort city southwest of
Tokyo that has been jolted by thousands of tremors and several
volcanic eruptions in the past two weeks.
``We've had an increasing number of patients complaining of
insomnia and gastritis due to stress and fear of earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions,'' said Mikio Kakefu, director of the National
Hospital in Ito City.
</P>
<P>
Ito, a coastal resort city on the Izu peninsula, about 60 miles
southwest of Tokyo, has had more than 23,000 temblors, including 486
strong enough to be felt, since June 30.
</P>
<P>
On July 13, an undersea volcano erupted off the Ito coast,
creating a mound 82 feet high, according to the Maritime Safety
Agency, Japan's coast guard.
</P>
<P>
Volcanic activity has slowed since then, and no strong
earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday. No injuries or damages
were reported after the eruption.
</P>
<P>
But the Central Meteorological Agency has warned the volcano is
likely to erupt again because the movement of magma, or molten rock,
continues.
</P>
<P>
Kakefu said the hospital, which has an average of 250 outpatients
daily, Monday began receiving more patients with stomach aches,
insomnia and diarrhea, ``all from fear and stress.''
``They didn't feel sick for a couple of days after the eruption
because they were still tense,'' he said. Kakefu said he does not
have any statistics, but indicated the number of such patients is
likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
Pets have also been developing similar symptoms since shortly
after the eruption, said Masaaki Mochizuki, an Ito veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
He said he has examined 129 cats and dogs suffering the
``earthquake syndrome'' between July 4 and July 14.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea and loss of appetite were
frequent among cats, and many dogs suffered skin problems including
rashes and hair loss, he said. He said some dogs were also afflicted
with coughing and trembling due to excessive fear.
``My busiest day was July 14, the day after the eruption,''
Mochizuki said. ``Symptoms in animals appeared earlier than in
people because animals are more sensitive, and they feel the
temblors and noises more strongly.''
``We humans have information from the municipal office and the
meteorological centers, which help to relieve our tensions ... but
such things don't work for animals,'' he said.

Quakes Gets Subdued Response From Neighbors of Long Valley Volcano
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years after a volcano scare incited
fear, anger and economic gloom in Sierra resorts, residents are
nonchalant about renewed underground lava movement that is
triggering thousands of tiny earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say there is a very small chance of a volcanic
eruption. But most of the quakes are too small to be felt, so ``you
don't really think about it,'' said Pam Murphy, spokeswoman for
Mammoth Mountain Ski Area.
``You can get hit by a car,'' she said. ``You can be in a plane
crash. The chances of those are a lot higher than the chance of
being killed by an earthquake or a volcano.''
``People who are frightened left long ago. I don't believe it's
a conscious concern of anyone in the community,'' said Mammoth
Lakes Mayor Gordon Alper.
</P>
<P>
The resort town's 4,700 permanent residents live in Long Valley,
a 19-mile-long, 9-mile-wide volcanic crater known as a caldera. It
is located on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada range 250 miles
north of Los Angeles. The Earth's crust is being stretched apart in
the region, allowing molten rock to fill half-mile-wide chambers
under the caldera.
</P>
<P>
The valley was created 730,000 years ago by one of Earth's most
powerful eruptions, a blast that spewed 600 times more material
than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
Eruptions somewhat smaller than Mount St. Helens' happened 550
years ago at the Inyo craters, which span Long Valley's north rim,
and 650 years ago at the Mono craters, several miles north of the
caldera.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current activity, the probability of a major
earthquake or a volcanic eruption in the area is ``less than 1
percent each year,'' said David Hill, the U.S. Geological Survey
geophysicist in charge of research at Long Valley.
</P>
<P>
Mono County Sheriff Martin Strelneck called such estimates ``a
scientific guessing game,'' and said area residents rarely discuss
the latest swarm of earthquakes, which started in May 1989.
</P>
<P>
That low-key attitude contrasts with feelings of anxiety, denial
and hostility when thousands of quakes - some exceeding 6 on the
Richter scale - rocked the area from 1979 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
During that period, subterranean molten rock pushed upward,
lifting the caldera's floor. As a result, the Geological Survey
issued a ``notice of potential volcanic hazard'' for Long Valley in
May 1982.
</P>
<P>
That warning, coupled with jarring earthquakes, damaged tourism
and aggravated a recession in the once-booming real estate market.
``The community overreacted,'' Murphy said. Residents accused
journalists of sensationalizing the possibility of an eruption and
denounced scientists for scaring people.
``Initially we thought this was a big ploy for them to get
funding from Congress,'' Alper said.
</P>
<P>
The hazard notice was rescinded in 1984 after the beleaguered
Geological Survey changed its warning system and seismic activity
diminished, reducing the possibility of an eruption.
</P>
<P>
Swarms of thousands of small quakes resumed 18 months ago and
continue to rattle Mammoth Lakes, June Lake, Lee Vining and other
Mono County resort towns. The temblors, most measuring 1 to 3 on
the Richter scale, started beneath Mammoth Mountain. In September
1989, they shifted to the caldera, where five to 10 small quakes
now happen daily.
</P>
<P>
A quake estimated at 5 to 5.8 on the Richter scale shook the
region last Tuesday, tumbling rocks onto Yosemite National Park's
roads. It was eastern California's largest quake since 1984, but
wasn't related to volcanic activity that causes the quake swarms,
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
Long Valley's floor continues to bulge upward as molten rock
moves inside two or three chambers about four miles under the
caldera, he said. The caldera floor rose about 2 feet since 1979,
including 3 inches in the past year.
</P>
<P>
While Long Valley ``is clearly an area that's showing unrest,
large calderas can do these kinds of things over years to decades
without necessarily erupting,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
The floor of a caldera near Naples, Italy, rose 9 feet between
1970 and 1984 but didn't erupt. Comparable uplift inside a New
Guinea caldera also failed to produce volcanic disaster.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hill said, eastern Sierra residents are addressing
the volcanic threat by developing or revising emergency plans and
helping the Geological Survey prepare a new system to issue a
warning if an eruption appeared likely.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Technology: Taming the volcanoes - Improved forecasting
techniques are making it easier to predict eruptions
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Volcanoes, which spit ash, ooze lava and create darkness in the middle of
the day, are impressive displays of nature's restlessness. They are also
life-threatening: more than 28,500 people died from eruptions during the
1980s. They can cause millions of dollars in property damage and bring
industrial activity to a grinding halt.
</P>
<P>
New technology to improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts is helping to
minimise the devastation volcanoes can cause. After the Nevado del Ruiz
eruption killed nearly 25,000 people in Colombia in 1986, the US government
began taking volcanic forecasting seriously. The US Geological Survey, which
tracks volcanic activity around the world, was infused with new funds to
create a detailed database and update its techniques.
</P>
<P>
The new technology will not only help to save thousands of lives, it may
also save millions of dollars. According to the Aviation Safety Journal,
more than 60 aircraft have been damaged by drifting clouds of volcanic ash
since 1980. The repair of a 747 aircraft damaged during the 1989 eruption
from Redoubt Volcano in Alaska cost Dollars 80m (Pounds 53m).
</P>
<P>
The continuous eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea since 1983 has caused more than
Dollars 5m in damage, much of it to properties and crops affected by the
acid-bearing volcanic pollutants. Mount St Helens in Washington state wiped
out thousands of acres of productive timberland.
</P>
<P>
Losses from interrupted economic activity are harder to quantify, but may be
more devastating. Redoubt's eruption, for instance, caused a valuable oil
storage terminal to close for several weeks and halted most flights into and
out of the region.
</P>
<P>
Tourism often takes the hardest hit of all. When US geologists issued
eruption warnings in California's Long Valley in 1982, the resort area
turned into a ghost town almost overnight. And the tourist-based economy of
Guadeloupe neared collapse in 1976 after an international group of
volcanologists forecast the eruption of La Soufriere.
</P>
<P>
The Long Valley and Guadeloupe incidents are tinged with bitterness since
the predicted disasters never happened. Guadeloupe evacuated 72,000 people
and tourists stayed away. Yet the only crisis that hit the Caribbean island
was in the economic sphere.
</P>
<P>
Scientists blame these fiascos on insufficient data. 'The identification of
fresh volcanic glass in the erupted ash - which seemed to indicate that the
volcano was about to erupt violently - was a mistake,' wrote Richard Fiske,
a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution, about the incident.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists today use more sophisticated techniques. Detailed databases
are maintained on all life-threatening volcanoes around the world.
</P>
<P>
High-frequency monitors to measure debris flows are now in place.
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes - often the first warning of volcanic activity - are tracked
with increasing accuracy. And changes in gas composition, electrical
conductivity and other clues are carefully monitored.
</P>
<P>
As a result, volcanic activity can now be forecast with substantial
accuracy, often pinpointing the eruption to within days or even hours of its
actual occurrence. When Redoubt erupted in Alaska in 1989 and Pinatubo blew
its top in the Philippines in 1991, volcanologists provided important
information, not only about the timing of the events, but also about the
direction of debris flows and ash blooms - vast clouds formed when tiny
pieces of lava or rock are thrown into the air.
</P>
<P>
'We used information on the ash blooms (during the Redoubt eruption) to know
which areas to stay away from, and which were safe to fly through,' says
Greg Witter, a spokesman for Alaska Air.
</P>
<P>
Companies can also take advantage of eruption forecasts to move valuable
equipment out of the way, and evacuate employees from the area.
</P>
<P>
'Businesses with sensitive electronics may want to shut down their air
filtration system during an ash bloom,' says Steven Brantley, public
information scientist with the US Geological Survey. Since ash blooms often
drift for many miles, they can wreak havoc on property well beyond the
life-threatening zone of eruption.
</P>
<P>
Volcanology can also be used for future planning. After much of its timber
was wiped out during the eruption of Mount St Helens, the paper group
Weyerhaeuser consulted experts to decide which areas should be replanted and
which avoided as too high-risk.
</P>
<P>
Not all businesses welcome the interference of volcanologists, however. In
Long Valley developers have refused to heed warnings in land use planning.
</P>
<P>
'We've had mixed results, because we can't force people to follow our
advice,' says Daniel Miller, a geologist with the US Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
'We've had a very negative and unpleasant response from businesses in Long
Valley. They just don't believe that they might be in a risk zone and insist
on building things anywhere they please.'
Developers in the region complain that the volcanologists' warnings have
resulted in higher insurance rates, limited areas of potential development
and stoked the fears of tourists.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between active volcanoes and the communities that surround
them is not always confrontational. Kilauea has become a leading Hawaiian
tourist attraction. It is considered the ideal volcano. Because the eruption
is continuous, it is seldom life-threatening and ash blooms are rare.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the volcano throws up a scenic display of colourful lava, which
attracts hikers by day and creates a natural light show at night.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have gleaned much useful information from the decade-long
eruption.
</P>
<P>
'The resorts look to us to provide information on best viewing times, which
they pass on to the tourists,' says David Clague, scientist in charge of the
Hawaii Volcano Observatory at Kilauea. 'It's generally pretty tame as far as
volcano eruptions go, but it's spectacular at night because it's
iridescent.'

VOLCANIC ACTIVITY SLOWLY BUILDING A PIECE OF REAL ESTATE IN THE PACIFIC; 
GEOLOGY: A NINTH HAWAIIAN ISLAND IS LIKELY TO RISE FROM THE SEA. BUT DEVELOPERS 
WILL HAVE TO WAIT THOUSANDS OF YEARS. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VOLCANO, Hawaii 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mysterious geologic forces behind the current eruptions of Mt. Kilauea are 
quietly creating the newest piece of America. 
</P>
<P>
Climbing with agonizing slowness from the warm tropical waters just southeast 
of the Big Island of Hawaii is an undersea mountain named Loihi. Volcanologists 
believe Loihi eventually could emerge as the ninth Hawaiian island. 
</P>
<P>
"Loihi has grown about 10,100 feet from the Pacific floor," Thomas L. Wright, 
scientist-in-charge of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said. "It seems to be 
tapping the same source of magma (lava still underground) as Kilauea. Loihi 
needs about 3,100 more feet to break the surface." 
</P>
<P>
The observatory, on the rim of Kilauea's summit caldera, or lava lake, is 
operated by the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Volcanoes have been creating and modifying the environment over eons of 
geologic time. More than 80% of Earth's surface is of volcanic origin. Volcanic 
eruptions have formed fertile soils and sculpted mountains, plateaus and other 
majestic landscapes. Gaseous emissions from volcanic vents helped to form the 
early atmosphere and oceans where scientists believe life first emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The volcanic machine powering Kilauea and building Loihi may represent the most 
visible and most persistent example of this little-known facet of volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
Kilauea has been in the news time and again since it resumed erupting on Jan. 
3, 1983. Lava oozing at the rate of 635,000 cubic feet each day has traveled 20 
miles east to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Lava flowing from the eruption, 50 feet thick in some places, already has 
torched 140 houses and caused more than $60 million in damage. Last May 5, a 
2,000-foot-wide flow cut off an entire village on the island's southeast coast, 
and Gov. John D. Waihee declared the town a disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
These highly publicized lava flows, and those silently lifting Loihi toward the 
surface, result from the peculiar form of volcanic activity occurring in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 500 active surface volcanoes on Earth straddle the margins of 
continents and the huge plates of rock that fit together like pieces of a 
jigsaw puzzle to make up the planet's surface. 
</P>
<P>
There are about a dozen of these plates, each of which is about 50 miles thick. 
The plates move relative to each other a few inches a year. Active volcanoes 
tend to occur in zones of under-thrusting, or "subduction," where one plate is 
slipping beneath another. 
</P>
<P>
How can volcanic activity occur in the Hawaiian Islands, which are more than 
2,000 miles from the nearest plate margin? 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian volcanoes are believed to result from a different phenomenon termed 
"hot spot" volcanism. Geologists theorize that deep under the Pacific plate is 
an exquisitely hot, stationary region termed the "Hawaiian hot spot." 
</P>
<P>
Like a propane torch placed under a moving sheet of plastic, the hot spot melts 
rock in the overriding Pacific plate. The molten rock, or magma, is less dense 
than surrounding solid rock and rises through fractures to spill onto the 
surface or ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
Over about 70 million years, the continuous movement of the Pacific plate over 
this stationary "fountain of fire" left a trail of more than 80 big volcanoes 
over the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Called the Hawaiian Ridge-Emperor Seamount 
Chain, the islands and undersea mountains, or seamounts, stretch northwestward 
about 4,000 miles, from the Big Island of Hawaii to the Kamchatka Peninsula in 
Soviet territory. 
</P>
<P>
The five main Hawaiian islands are the tops of volcanic mountains that were 
formed as the Pacific plate moved over the Hawaiian hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
A scientific record of the plate's movement to the northwest is evident in the 
age of solidified lava left on each of the islands. The age decreases from 
northwest to southeast. Kauai, in the extreme northwest, is 5.6 million years 
old; Oahu is 3.4 million; Molokai is 1.8 million, Maui is 800,000, Hawaii is 
under 700,000 years old. Lava ages even decrease in the same 
northwest-to-southeast fashion on each individual island. 
</P>
<P>
Continued movement of the Pacific plate promises to give the goddess Pele a new 
home and Hawaii a new island. 
</P>
<P>
If theories about hot spot volcanism are correct, plate movement eventually 
will carry the Big Island off the Hawaiian hot spot. The two active volcanoes 
on the island, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, will become extinct. The hot spot then 
will pour molten rock onto the surface through the next volcano in the Hawaiian 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
Experts do not know exactly when Loihi will emerge as a new island. Assuming 
Loihi's growth continues at current rates, it could take from a few thousand to 
a few tens of thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
But other fates also may await the infant volcano. 
</P>
<P>
Infusions of molten rock from the hot spot, for instance, may cease 
unexpectedly. Loihi's growth would be stunted, leaving it just another seamount 
in the chain. The ninth Hawaiian island thus may form in an entirely different 
place. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the possibility a sudden major undersea eruption could raise 
Loihi to the surface sooner than anyone expects.

SCIENCE VOLCANOLOGY; 
ERUPTION PRECEDED BY SMALL BOOST IN GRAVITY 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British researchers have found "the first unambiguous evidence" that small 
changes in gravity can precede a volcanic eruption. 
</P>
<P>
In an article published today in the journal Nature the researchers report that 
gravity increased at the Poas volcano in Costa Rica over a two-year period 
before the volcano erupted in April and May of 1989. The increased gravity was 
thought to result from the intrusion of dense molten rock into the volcanic 
cone. 
</P>
<P>
Geophysicists Helen Rymer and Geoff Brown of the Open University in Milton 
Keynes, England, believe that measurements of very small changes in gravity - 
called microgravity - can be used to predict eruptions of certain types of 
volcanoes like Poas. 
</P>
<P>
Rymer speculated that Poas may erupt again next April or May. 
</P>
<P>
Rymer and Brown are also now beginning to monitor microgravity at Mt. Etna in 
Sicily, where the population in the area is threatened by periodic eruptions. 
</P>

"Microgravity would seem to be a very promising technique that should be used 
(for predicting volcanic eruptions)," said geophysicist Dan Dzurisin of the 
U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Washington. But the 
technique has yet to be tested, in part, because monitoring changes in 
microgravity is an extremely labor-intensive process that cannot be readily 
automated. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most studies have measured microgravity changes only at long 
intervals, often simply before and after a volcanic eruption, and the results 
have been open to various interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
The Rymer and Brown study, in which microgravity was measured at regular 
intervals over a 10-year period, "represents the first time we can see a 
progression in microgravity over a long period of time" so that the results are 
much clearer, said geologist Al Eggers of the University of Puget Sound in 
Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Measuring gravitational changes is extraordinarily exacting, Dzurisin said. The 
accelerometers that are used are highly sensitive and easily get out of 
calibration, he said. It is thus necessary to calibrate the instruments 
frequently by moving them to a site where gravity does not change, requiring a 
constant human presence. 
</P>
<P>
The process is even more complicated because the accelerometers are sensitive 
to slight changes in elevation - changes as small as fractions of an inch. (If 
the device is raised an inch, for example, it is that much farther from the 
center of the Earth, so that the pull of gravity is slightly less.) 
</P>
<P>
Measurements of gravity must be accompanied by highly accurate measurements of 
the level of land at the measurement site so that changes in elevation - which 
often occur before volcanic eruptions - are not misinterpreted as actual 
changes in gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Poas volcano is a classical cone-shaped volcano with a clear, deep (120 to 150 
feet) lake in its center. The lake is normally quite warm, about 104 degrees 
Fahrenheit, indicating that at least some molten rock lies close to the surface 
and heats it. 
</P>
<P>
After the volcano's last eruption in 1953, the lake filled to its normal depth 
and remained stable for three decades. But in 1983, Rymer said in a telephone 
interview, the lake's level began dropping slowly. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, when Rymer and Brown began detecting an increase in microgravity, the 
lake level was dropping much more rapidly. Rymer believes the molten rock, or 
magma, that was causing the gravity to increase was also heating the water and 
making it evaporate faster. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, geysers of water began erupting and the water level went down 
even faster. By April of this year, the water was gone and the volcano erupted 
in a mile-high cloud of ash. The ash eruptions subsided when spring rains 
re-established the lake, Rymer said, but she believes the volcano may erupt 
again as the lake is depleted during the coming dry season. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers do not know what happened to gravity levels after the eruption 
because their funding expired at about the same time the volcano erupted. But 
they will go back to Costa Rica in March to take new measurements. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons learned at Poas may not be applicable everywhere. Although Japanese 
researchers have some preliminary evidence of increases in microgravity before 
volcanic eruptions, Eggers found that microgravity actually decreased at Pacayo 
volcano in Guatemala before an eruption 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers speculates that the decrease was caused by formation of gaseous pockets 
in the magma. 
</P>
<P>
Still other volcanoes monitored by Dzurisin and others have shown no apparent 
changes. But it is likely, Dzurisin said, that each volcano has its own 
characteristic pattern of gravity changes and that once those changes are 
known, the pattern can be used for future predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Rymer noted, both Poas and Mt. Etna are filled with very light 
material, so that the intrusion of magma is more readily detected. In such 
cases, she said, gravity changes should be a particularly useful predictive 
tool.

  FORECASTING VOLCANOES
SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED MUCH IN THE PAST
DECADE  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE FIRST THREATS were subtle:;    Steam curling from a fissure. A flurry of
small earthquakes, too faint to be felt.  
</P>
<P>
The Mount Pinatubo volcano was slowly rousing from 600 years of sleep.;   
Two months ago, when the drama began, scientists knew almost nothing about
this drowsy Philippine giant, swaddled in thick jungle and ignored by the
hundreds of thousands of people living around its flanks.;    They didn't know
it had a habit of exploding with a force twice as great as the 1980 eruption
of Mount St. Helens in Washington - or that the debris from these eruptions
had covered much of what was now Clark Air Base.;    But with the first small
signs of trouble, researchers went on alert, throwing a network of instruments
around the restless mountain. And in a few frenzied weeks of investigation,
they learned enough to recommend evacuation of some 84,000 people.;    The
warning came just in time. A series of violent eruptions has rocked the
mountain since Wednesday, blowing ash and pumice 80,000 feet in the air and
sifting volcanic grit over villages 90 miles away. At least 101 people have
been killed, 150,000 Filipinos have crowded into refugee centers in Manila and
20,000 American military dependents and civilian workers are being evacuated
from the country. U.S. officials said the damage may lead them to permanently
close Clark Air Base.;    On Monday, scientists said much of the pressure
inside the volcano had dissipated and the worst may be over.;    Although
Pinatubo never erupted into the cataclysmic blow-up that some had feared, the
damage and death toll from related earthquakes, mudslides and falling ash and
pumice could have been far higher had scientists not recommended evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The successful forecast points up just how far the science of volcanoes has
come in the past decade.;    The basics are the same. Researchers still use
seismometers and other instruments to measure the trembling, quaking and
bulging of the ground that often spell danger.;    But the technology has
improved immensely:;    (check) Instruments are cheaper and more expendable,
so they can be deployed where they will do the most good - right in the path
of the volcano's fury.;    (check) The instruments continually beam data to
scientists who are waiting a safe distance away. Before, they had to visit
their instruments and collect the data by hand.;    (check) Information is
routinely analyzed by computer, allowing researchers to assess a situation
quickly - and to develop computer models for predicting the behavior of
volcanoes.;    Researchers have also made strides in interpreting what they
see. "Our biggest improvement has been in our own heads," said Peter Lipman, a
volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.;    These skills
were honed in a series of volcanic disasters that rocked the world over the
past decade.;    "The 1980s was a very interesting decade because of the
number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring
information," said Steven Brantley, a geologist with the survey's Cascades
Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash. "It was a rather remarkable decade,
really.";    Scientists say the eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed 57
people and caused $1 billion in property damage, triggered a renaissance in
volcano research.;    It alerted the American public to volcano hazards and
prompted a tenfold increase in government spending for volcano research and
monitoring, said geologist Robert Tilling of USGS in Menlo Park.;    As a
result, the survey opened two new volcano observatories. One, in Washington,
keeps track of active volcanoes in the Cascades Range of the Pacific Northwest
and Northern California, including Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount
Hood, Mount Baker, Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen. The second is in Alaska,
where Redoubt Volcano put on a spectacular show in 1989 and 1990. A third
observatory has been operating in Hawaii since 1912.;    American scientists
have since responded to a number of volcanic awakenings throughout the world,
from Galunggung in Indonesia to Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, improving their
ability to quickly evaluate volcano hazards. Such a quick response is crucial
because only a few dozen of the world's 500 active volcanoes have been
adequately investigated and monitored.;    "Now," Tilling said, "we can go in
there and literally overnight set up a seismic network, and start getting data
within a day or two.";    The blossoming research has in turn spurred
development of cheaper and more rugged instruments.;    Take tiltmeters.;   
Like glorified carpenters' levels, they are used to measure the bulging and
tilting of the ground as magma muscles its way toward the surface.;    A
decade ago they cost thousands of dollars each. But after Mount St. Helens
blew, scientists looked for cheaper models. One was developed by James
Westphal, a well-known astronomer and gadgeteer at the California Institute of
Technology, who patterned it after an idea used in missile guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
Now tiltmeters are inexpensive enough to place in areas likely to get wiped
out in eruptions.;    The humble seismometer has also grown more useful as
scientists learn to better interpret what it's saying.;    "Volcanoes are
probably the most complex structures you can find on this planet," said
Bernard Chouet, a seismologist at the USGS in Menlo Park.;    It's not unusual
for them to produce thousands of small earthquakes - but those quakes can
have a variety of causes. Most are innocuous, caused by the cracking of rock
above pools of magma that, for the moment, aren't going anywhere. But others
are ominous, reflecting the surge of magma toward the surface in preparation
for an eruption.;    In the past few years, Chouet said, seismologists have
learned to recognize distinctive tremors that mean an eruption is on its way.
</P>
<P>
These patterns were successfully used to forecast the 1989 eruption of Redoubt
Volcano in Alaska, as well as the current eruptions at Pinatubo.;    But even
though volcano warnings have proved far more accurate than earthquake
forecasts, they're far from foolproof.;    Some volcanoes give virtually no
warning. Even when they do, the decision to evacuate is difficult and
expensive. In the Philippines, for instance, vandals looted parts of Clark Air
Base that were left unguarded. Factories and businesses shut down; crops and
livestock were left unattended.;    This time the evacuation paid off,
possibly averting a number of deaths. But it won't always. In the end, every
volcano is a rugged individualist, with its own distinct patterns of activity.
</P>
<P>
Some wake up, make threatening noises for weeks or months, then drift back to
sleep.;    The burden of deciding whether to warn the public weighs heavily on
scientists.;    Randall White, another seismologist with the USGS in Menlo
Park, recalled how he felt while working near the freezing summit of
Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz six years ago.;    Struggling to hear their
instruments above the noise of nearby broadcast towers, he and his colleagues
warned local officials that an eruption was on its way. But their warnings
were vain. For reasons that are still unclear, the officials did not order an
evacuation, and 22,000 people died after lava spewed from the volcano, melting
glaciers and forming devastating mudslides.;    "I found it nerve-racking,"
White said. "We were literally afraid to go to sleep at night, thinking that
some technician would get the interpretation (of the incoming data) wrong, and
a lot of people would die.";  Tools give clues that can save lives;    The
basic tools of volcano monitoring are cheaper and more portable than they were
10 years ago. Scientists can move in fast and set up instruments that
continually broadcast readings, which are then analyzed by computer. This
allows quicker evaluation of volcano hazards - and forecasts that can save
lives.; 1. Surveying: Researchers measure the volcano, with optical
instruments or high-tech laser tools, to see if it is bulging or stretching as
a result of magma rising inside. They also put tiltmeters near the volcano's
vent to record changes in the slope of the ground.; 2. Pick and shovel:
Geologists dig through layers of old ash and lava to determine how often a
volcano erupted in the past - a clue to what it might do in the future. The
thicker and more extensive the deposit, the bigger the eruption.; 3.
</P>
<P>
Seismometer: Measures ground shaking. Volcanoes often produce swarms of small
earthquakes. Researchers are learning to distinguish ordinary earthquakes from
those caused by magma rising toward the surface - a sign of impending
eruption.; 4. Spectrometer: First developed to measure pollutants from factory
smokestacks, it is now also used to measure sulfur dioxide in the smoke
belched by volcanoes. Increasing levels of the gas may signal an impending
eruption. The amount of gas reflects the amount of magma beneath the volcano,
and thus the potential size of the eruption.;    Sources: Robert Tilling and

Mount Pinatubo shook with a series of minor earthquakes today and spewed ash
four miles high after an ash-clogged river buried homes northwest of Manila.; 
No deaths were reported in the volcanic mudflows because residents had
evacuated to higher ground.  
</P>
<P>
In Japan, heavy rain sent tons of mud and volcanic debris cascading down
Mount Unzen, washing away or damaging at least 70 empty houses and slightly
injuring one fleeing resident, officials said today.;    Weather forecasters
predicted continuing rain in the area.;    In the Philippines, 4,795-foot
Mount Pinatubo is in its fourth week of eruptions after being dormant 600
years. Officials say 338 people have been killed during the eruptions.;   
Volcanologist Julio Sabit said low-frequency tremors, similar to those
observed prior to major eruptions three weeks ago, preceded the ash ejection
this morning.;    Authorities warned residents to be alert for high walls of
flowing volcanic ash, boulders and debris that move rapidly downstream and can
bury whole towns in their path.;    Mudflows hit settlements near the towns of
Porac and Florida Blanca, about 40 miles northwest of Manila.;    Witnesses
said houses were buried up to their rooftops and an undetermined number of
cattle were killed.;    There were sketchy reports today of similar mudflows
in the Balintawak River northwest of the volcano but poor communications made
it impossible to verify the reports.;    Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos,
chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council, said crews were
deepening river channels near the volcano in hopes of preventing spillovers.; 
The eruptions severely damaged the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and Subic Bay
Naval Base, raising doubts over their future. The lease on the bases expires
Sept. 16, and talks resume here this month in an effort to reach an agreement
on a possible extension.;    U.S. officials said today they expect to complete
a damage assessment of the bases by July 9.;    The Philippine government has
also not completed its assessment of overall damage, which was extensive.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Senen Bacani said today that damage to crops alone was
$15 million.;    Near Mount Unzen in Japan, the flow of mud, almost 450 feet
wide, started Sunday and was knee-deep today in an abandoned residential area
along the Mizunashi River.;    Many residents along the river left their homes
after Mount Unzen erupted in early June, killing 41 people. About 1,200 people
were evacuated from the area Sunday as rain swept ash and basketball-size
rocks down three rivers.;    By this afternoon, the mudflow had reached
Shimabara port, five miles east of the 4,485-foot volcano, police said. It
wrecked a bridge and partially blocked a road and a railway as it swept
through Shimabara, a city of 45,000 residents, said a Nagasaki police
officer.;    The observatory monitoring Mount Unzen said volcanic debris still
covering the east side of the mountain lends itself to landslides. It said the
volcano is still spewing out gas, rocks and ash.;    About 9,000 people have
been evacuated from the foot of Mount Unzen.;    Mount Unzen, 610 miles
southwest of Tokyo, erupted Nov. 17 for the first time in 198 years.;    Unzen
was the site of Japan's worst volcanic disaster, which killed about 15,000
people in 1792.

  POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECT OF PINATUBO ERUPTION:
COOLER CLIMATE  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, "once in a blue moon" is now.;   
Volcanic dust and gases, lofted into the stratosphere last month by the
Philippine volcano's cataclysmic eruption, have spread all the way around the
Earth in a wide band along the equator. Within a few months, the plume should
spread to cover the entire Northern Hemisphere, perhaps causing a measurable
cooling in climate.  
</P>
<P>
In tropical regions, said atmospheric scientist Brian Toon, "green suns and
blue moons are probably being seen now" because of the volcanic plume being
carried by stratospheric winds.;    In the fall, throughout the Northern
Hemisphere, "it will be extremely obvious to the ordinary person. At sunrise
and sunset, the horizon will have a glowing purplish color.";    Drivers
heading toward the sun will see extra-intense glare. And airliners' windows
may be etched by acid, as happened after the 1982 eruption of Mexico's El
Chichon volcano, said Toon, of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View. Sulfuric acid in the
air comes from huge amounts of sulfur dioxide released by the volcano.;   
Last month's eruption of Mount Pinatubo produced a massive cloud of dust,
sulfur dioxide and other gases that rose into the stratosphere, reaching
altitudes between 80,000 and 120,000 feet. The plume is at least twice as
large as El Chichon's, Toon said, and probably will remain aloft for years.;  
Jim Lynch, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is
tracking the plume using instruments aboard the Nimbus-7 satellite. He said,
"All indications are that this eruption has exceeded El Chichon by two or
three times.";    Toon said that in the past 80 years, there have been only
three volcanic eruptions that might have global climatic impact - El Chichon
in Mexico; Agung, which erupted in Bali in 1963; and Pinatubo.;    The cloud
now covers a zone 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south of the equator, so
almost 50 percent of the globe is blanketed.;    "We're expecting it to stay
around for about five years. With time it will spread north and south from
where it is," Lynch said.;    Whether climatic cooling will result from
Pinatubo's eruption is not known, scientists said. El Chichon may have caused
a fraction of a degree of global cooling, but researchers are still unsure. El
Chichon's eruption coincided with an El Nino climatic event, which may have
reversed or accentuated the volcanic effects. Another El Nino seems to have
started recently, scientists said.;    An El Nino event - which involves
periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean's surface waters - can severely disturb
normal climate.
