<P>
Michael Milken, who faces insider
trading charges, is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made
``junk-bond'' financing into the tool of choice for corporate
raiders.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, Milken, 42, transformed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
from a minor player on Wall Street into a powerhouse and in the
process made himself feared, respected and enormously wealthy.
</P>
<P>
The 184-page civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New
York against Milken, Drexel and others on Wednesday followed months
of speculation about Drexel's involvement in the Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandal.
</P>
<P>
Although the move by the Securities and Exchange Commission had
been anticipated, Milken and others who have made fortunes in junk
bonds continued to hold their annual Beverly Hills spring gathering
known as the Predators' Ball. The message was clear: Never mind the
burgeoning government investigation of insider trading. It was
business as usual at Drexel, and Milken was still king of the junk
bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate
takeovers.
</P>
<P>
Milken had refused to comment publicly on the scandal up until
Wednesday, when he issued a written statement asserting that ``for
the past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadow trial of
systematic leaks and innuendo based on false accusations.''
In anticipation of a crisis, Drexel undertook a public-relations
campaign starting last year to polish its image, stressing the role
of junk bonds in helping small companies and downplaying their role
in large takeover battles.
</P>
<P>
The normally secretive and unreachable Milken himself played a
major role in that blitz, accepting speaking engagements. He
granted selective media interviews _ on condition there would be no
questions about the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The speeches and interviews focused almost solely on Milken's
latest pet plan _ to alleviate the Latin American debt crisis by
swapping debt for equity or selling securities backed by those
countries' oil and silver resources.
</P>
<P>
In the years before the insider trading scandal, the financial
media wrote glowingly of Milken.
``A one-man revolution,'' Forbes magazine headlined one typical
article.
``A world-class financial wizard, on a plane with the likes of
Bernard Baruch and Jay Gould ... Mozart of the money markets,''
wrote California Business magazine.
</P>
<P>
It had been a relatively short road for Milken, from head
cheerleader at Birmingham High School in the San Fernando Valley in
1964 _ actress Sally Field and superagent Michael Ovitz were among
his classmates _ to the top of the nation's financial industry.
</P>
<P>
Milken reportedly pulls down $40 million a year as the head of
Drexel's junk-bond operation and his personal fortune has been
estimated at more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
He lives with his children and wife, Lori _ his high school
sweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the former
estate of the late actor Clark Gable in suburban Encino, an
upper-middle-class section of the San Fernando Valley two miles
from his childhood home.
</P>
<P>
Milken's fascination with finance stetches back to his boyhood.
</P>
<P>
At age 10, while other boys were giggling over comic books,
Michael Robert Milken was enamored of money. A favorite pastime was
hovering over tax returns being prepared by his father, an
accountant.
</P>
<P>
After studying business at the University of California,
Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,
Milken went to work for Drexel Firestone 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co. in Philadelphia as a
junior bond trader.
</P>
<P>
Drexel merged with Burnham 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co. in 1973 and Lambert Brussels
Witter in 1976 to become today's Drexel Burnham Lambert, and
Milken's job was moved to New York.
</P>
<P>
Milken worked hard to make a name for himself but never got used
to the East. As the story goes, he wearied of the cold Eastern
winters that froze his water pipes and kept his two children from
playing outside. He also tired of the long commutes from his home
in suburban Philadelphia to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
In 1977, he pulled off a coup by convincing Drexel to let him
move the company's junk-bond operations from Wall Street to Beverly
Hills, just off swank Rodeo Drive.
</P>
<P>
His reasoning was simple: He didn't have to be sitting in a tiny
office in Manhattan to make deals. He just had to know the players
and have their confidence.
</P>
<P>
Milken was enormously successful in that regard, almost
single-handedly building a close-knit network of junk-bond
investors. Milken no longer has to go on the road to make deals.
</P>
<P>
The corporate players come to him.
</P>
<P>
Milken still works hard _ 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a
week. He once said he had no hobbies ``because what I do is fun.''
Milken's appearance generally is described as ordinary. He buys
his suits off the rack, and it was only a couple years ago that he
traded in his unstylish American car for a Mercedes.

Indicted Bond Trader Quits Drexel, Sets Up Own Firm
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken, the fallen Drexel Burnham Lambert
financier, is striking out on his own.
</P>
<P>
But what isn't clear is whether loyal ex-colleagues will follow
the Pied Piper of junk bonds to his new firm _ and how long the
venture will last with Milken facing a lengthy jail term.
</P>
<P>
Milken, 42, resigned Thursday after 19 years at Drexel, where he
began a wildly successful career that helped reshape corporate
America in the 1980s through the pioneering use of low-grade
securities called junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
Milken, who made a reported $550 million in 1987, said he is
forming a consulting firm to assist companies that want to raise
money to start up, grow or stay in business.
</P>
<P>
But he faces $1.85 billion in forfeitures of alleged illegal
profits and a lengthy jail term if convicted on a 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment, the government's largest securities crime
prosecution to date.
</P>
<P>
People involved in Milken's plans for the new firm, International
Capital Assets Group, said Milken does not intend to raid Drexel's
Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond division, which he founded and ran
until his March indictment.
</P>
<P>
The principals in the new firm, which now has a handful of
employees and a temporary Los Angeles office, are not going to be
``Drexel people,'' Milken associates said.
</P>
<P>
But Milken still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junk
bond employees and Drexel clients, and no one is ruling out
defections. Milken associates did not release details on his plans,
including whether an affiliated brokerage would be formed.
</P>
<P>
A Drexel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Wall Street giant does not anticipate conflicts with Milken's new
firm because it will not be in the brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
Under Drexel's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider
trading and other fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Drexel and its employees are barred from doing business
with Milken, directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
The Drexel official said the provision likely will be reviewed on
a case-by-case basis, so some contact between the New York
investment firm's clients and Milken may occur. For instance, Milken
may be able to refer clients to Drexel and vice versa but not
receive any fees.
</P>
<P>
Milken's resignation ends the relationship between one of the
most important financial players of the decade and the firm he
helped boost from a second-tier brokerage to the nation's fifth
largest.
``Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel
Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad
event,'' Drexel stated. ``We wish him well in his new endeavor.''
Milken widely was credited with creating a $175 billion-a-year
junk bond market. His pitchman sale of the bonds _ previously used
mainly by companies with low credit ratings _ helped fuel the
decade's corporate takeover mania by giving smaller companies and
corporate raiders a tool for financing growth, mergers and takeovers.
</P>
<P>
But the federal government alleges Milken used his powers through
Drexel to engage in a range of securities crimes, including schemes
with now-jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky.
</P>
<P>
He also is accused of insider trading in a separate SEC lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
No settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled in that case.
</P>
<P>
Milken had been on leave from Drexel since his criminal
indictment. His brother, Lowell, who also was charged in the case,
announced Thursday he was quitting the firm to return to practicing
law.
``I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as
part of the firm's settlement with the government, but I look
forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies,''
Michael Milken said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Milken joined Drexel full-time in 1970 after graduating from the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. In 1978, he moved
Drexel's junk bond division to Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
Milken's trial in federal court in Manhattan is set for next
March. He is free under a $700 million bond package.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers close to the case indicated Milken's decision to resign
was calculated. By quitting, Milken pre-empts the firm's agreement
with the SEC to dismiss him once the settlement is approved by a
federal judge.
</P>
<P>
With Milken's resignation, lawyers may argue that parts of the
Drexel pact are moot and mount further challenges. They also are
expected to challenge the provision barring Drexel and Milken from
doing business with the same clients.

Troubled Thrift With Largest Junk Bond Holding Sues Milken for
Fraud
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columbia Savings 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Loan Association has filed a
$6 billion civil lawsuit accusing Michael Milken and other former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk
bonds in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by the failing savings and loan,
claims that Milken and others manipulated and coerced Columbia and
other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky
high-yield bonds.
``Absent such deceit and manipulations it would have been clear
that the market for junk bonds was highly illiquid and that junk
bonds were unsuitable investments for savings and loan
institutions,'' the suit says.
</P>
<P>
Columbia once was a major Drexel customer. It holds a junk bond
portfolio with a face value of over $4 billion, the largest of any
thrift. Milken had a close business relationship with former
Columbia chairman Thomas Spiegel, who resigned last year.
</P>
<P>
Milken, the former head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based
junk bond department, was sentenced last month to 10 years in
prison for six felonies related to illegal trading practices. None
of the charges involved junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit by Columbia, filed in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, names Milken, nine other Drexel officials and more than
100 investment partnerships sponsored by the collapsed Wall Street
firm.
</P>
<P>
It alleges that the thrift lost more than $2 billion on
investments in junk bonds and seeks three times that amount under
federal racketeering and antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, said in the lawsuit that
Milken and other Drexel officials manipulated, coerced and deceived
the thrift by promising that the market for the bonds would remain
active and the thrift would make money.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, a spokesman for Milken said the lawsuit was
without merit. The statement said Columbia was an independent
institution that made its own investment decisions, often in
disagreement with Milken.
``It is outrageous now to blame Michael Milken for losses as a
result of strategies and decisions that were implemented long after
he was no longer active at Drexel Burnham Lambert, and which he did
not endorse or agree with,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Milken resigned from Drexel last year but the statement said he
had gradually reduced his day-to-day activity after he was linked
to the government's Wall Street investigation in late 1986.
</P>
<P>
It said the lawsuit amounts to ``shifting the blame to the most
convenient scapegoat on the financial scene - Michael Milken - who
has been blamed for every problem facing the U.S. economy except
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.''
The lawsuit joins scores of other civil complaints against
Milken for alleged wrongdoing related to his guilty plea as well as
other trading activity during his tenure at Drexel, which is now in
federal bankruptcy court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The 176-page lawsuit by Columbia also claims that Milken and
other Drexel employees appropriated stock in buyouts for themselves
via the investment partnerships that should have gone to junk bond
buyers in the deals.
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses Milken and others of manipulating the junk bond
market, giving bribes and stock investment opportunities to some
thrift executives, misappropriating valuable stock interests in
junk bond deals, skimming profits from junk bond trading, and
controlling through illegal means a web of thrifts and other
investors in junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
Columbia was one of many savings and loans, big investors and
other institutions that invested heavily in deals financed or
supported by Drexel in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Columbia says in the suit that its junk bonds have a total face
value of $4.3 billion, but that it has written down their value to
$2.5 billion to account for the decline in their market price. It
also says it has suffered actual losses of $200 million through the
sale of some bonds.
</P>
<P>
The suit says Columbia was ``ill-equipped'' to make use of
relaxed federal laws in the early 1980s that allowed thrifts to
invest in corporate securities such as junk bonds. It alleges that
Milken and the others exploited this weakness.
</P>
<P>
The savings and loan is expected to be take over soon by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as part of the nation's costly
thrift bailout.
</P>
<P>
The FDIC and Resolution Trust Corp., which administers the
failed thrifts, already have filed a claim for $4.5 billion against
Drexel in federal bankruptcy court alleging that fraudulent junk
bond dealings caused Columbia heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Also named in the Milken lawsuit are former Drexel chief
executive Frederick Joseph; Milken's brother, Lowell, also a former
Drexel executive; Peter Ackerman, Drexel's former chief of capital
markets; and other officials.
</P>
<P>
As part of his settlement of criminal and civil charges by the
government, Milken has agreed to place $400 million in a fund to
compensate investors harmed by his actions. But he would remain
liable for awards exceeding the amount in the fund.

PIONEER, BILLIONAIRE - AND, SOON, UNEMPLOYED; 
MICHAEL MILKEN MADE DREXEL A LEADER IN 'JUNK BONDS.' NOW IT HAS AGREED TO SACK 
HIM. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time he was a high school student in the San Fernando Valley, it was 
clear that Michael Milken had a bright future. He was voted most likely to 
succeed, head cheerleader, king of the senior prom and president of the men's 
honor organization. Classmates probably wouldn't have been surprised if he 
became a millionaire by the age of 30. 
</P>
<P>
By many estimates, Milken probably achieved that milestone, because by the age 
of 30 he was a fast-rising star at the fast-rising securities firm of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc., managing its high-yield "junk bond" operations and 
reaping huge profits for the firm and himself. Last July, when he hit the age 
of 42, Milken had become one of the nation's richest men, with an estimated net 
worth of close to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The news Wednesday that Milken will be fired by Drexel and will not paid his 
1988 bonus of $200 million as part of the company's settlement of securities 
fraud charges signals the end to the Milken era at Drexel. But it doesn't close 
the book on his impact on corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Robert Milken, the center of the nation's biggest securities fraud 
investigation ever, arguably is the most significant and visionary figure in 
American business in the 1980s, the J. P. Morgan of his generation who 
unleashed a revolution in how businesses raise capital to finance growth. 
</P>
<P>
Milken virtually single-handedly pioneered the modern junk bond market, now 
worth $180 billion in total bonds outstanding, and the fuel that has financed 
hundreds of small- and middle-size businesses and wave after wave of corporate 
takeovers. Milken's actions directly or indirectly touched the lives of 
millions of Americans, from ordinary workers to high-powered corporate 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
He also steered Wall Street into a new and far more aggressive role in 
takeovers - and not just by advising in them or financing them. He actually 
created and built up entire entities and corporate raiders who launched bids, 
partly with the aim of reviving the era of the owner-manager and making giant 
corporations lean and mean again. 
</P>
<P>
"He has indelibly changed the course and face of the investment banking 
business and the economy as a whole," said Fredric Roberts, head of a Los 
Angeles investment banking firm bearing his name and Southern California 
district director for the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for all his contributions, Milken's name is hardly a household word. He 
shunned publicity and did his deal-making in relative secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
He also has been a man of sharp contrasts. He has an unusual recollection of 
detail and could recite the terms on every high-yield bond in America. Yet he 
reportedly forgot who was the best man at his wedding. He is an intense 
workaholic who got to the office by 4:30 every morning and typically worked 
15-hour days. Yet he is described by friends as a devoted family man who, until 
his latest legal troubles mounted, spent long hours with his three children, 
all of whom have suffered from various health problems. 
</P>
<P>
History has yet to render a final verdict on Milken as a saint or a sinner, or 
something in between. His crowning achievement - the creation and growth of 
the modern junk bond market - has yet to weather a serious recession. And 
while his junk bond machine transformed Drexel from a second-rate securities 
firm into one of the most powerful on Wall Street, his alleged transgressions 
as its junk bond chief ultimately could be the firm's undoing. 
</P>
<P>
While Milken's junk bonds helped companies create thousands of new jobs, they 
also led to layoffs of workers at firms taken over by raiders financed by junk 
bonds. And while Milken's family foundations donated millions of dollars of his 
profits to various charitable causes, he also is accused of questionable 
practices that netted exorbitant profits for himself and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the future of Drexel and its once-star junk bond chief, it is 
clear that Milken is an exceptional individual who was driven from the very 
beginning with unusual determination. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the San Fernando Valley as the son of an accountant, Milken gained 
business experience as a teen-ager helping his father prepare tax returns. 
Attending Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, he served as head cheerleader on 
a squad that included future actress Sally Field. He was voted the "most 
spirited" and "friendliest" member of his graduating class of 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Managed Investments 
</P>
<P>
"He was very successful in everything he did, whether it was sports or school 
service or debate," recalled Harry Horowitz, a Milken friend since childhood 
who followed him to Drexel and now serves as a senior vice president there. 
"He's always been in a leadership role in anything he's been involved with." 
</P>
<P>
Milken then earned an undergraduate degree in business administration at UC 
Berkeley, avoiding the anti-war campus unrest of the time, serving instead as 
president of his fraternity. As a sidelight, Milken managed investments for a 
small group of clients, eating losses himself in exchange for half the profits. 
</P>
<P>
After marrying his high-school sweetheart, Lori Hackel, Milken moved to the 
Philadelphia area, where he attended the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton 
Graduate School of Business, becoming one of its brightest students and working 
part time in the Philadelphia office of a precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
While at Wharton, Milken began to take an interest in the securities that would 
make him legendary. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds at the time were primarily debt issues that were once highly rated 
but had fallen in value and increased in risk when the issuing companies fell 
on hard times. Milken believed that investors were overly pessimistic about 
these bonds - which often could be bought for as little as 20 cents or 30 
cents on the dollar - and that their higher yields more than compensated for 
their added risk of default. Investors holding diversified portfolios of many 
junk bonds would earn higher profits, even if some of the bonds defaulted, he 
reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's shrewd trading of junk bonds soon began making millions of dollars for 
Drexel - and for himself and his band of hard-working traders and salesmen. 
Finally, in 1978, Milken asked to move the junk bond trading operation from New 
York to the Century City section of Los Angeles. (It moved in 1983 to its 
present home on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.) Out West, Milken felt he could 
work long hours yet still be home in time for dinner with his family. Milken, 
friends say, also wanted to be close to his father, who was then dying of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Began Underwriting 
</P>
<P>
Drexel executives were reportedly uncomfortable with the move because it also 
would give Milken more independence. But they granted it because they had no 
choice, given Milken's megabuck success. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Milken found that trading junk bonds wasn't enough. He and Drexel began 
underwriting new junk bonds, issued by companies that were too small, young or 
risky to get conventional bank loans or issue conventional high-rated corporate 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Milken viewed the issuance of junk bonds by small- and medium-size companies as 
part of a crusade to change the face of corporate America. Milken correctly 
felt that those companies were the economy's true job creators, and allowing 
them access to capital markets would unleash a wave of entrepreneurial 
innovation that would make America more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
To spur this crusade, Milken also created and unleashed a stable of corporate 
raiders whose hostile takeover bids were made possible by junk financing. 
Milken-backed entrepreneurs - such as T. Boone Pickens Jr., who launched 
unsuccessful bids for Phillips Petroleum, Gulf Oil and Unocal; Ronald O. 
Perelman, who took over Revlon, and Carl C. Icahn, who took over TWA - would 
displace managements that had grown tired and stale, Milken reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital is no longer a scarce resource," Milken told a group of high school 
students in a 1986 speech. "(The) scarce resource today is management, 
knowledge, vision, dealing with change, recognizing what people want and need 
in the future and the ability to work together." 
</P>
<P>
Showed Genuine Interest 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen were mesmerized by Milken's broad insight, knowledge and charm. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was extremely supportive," said Robert Berglass, chairman and 
president of Dep Corp., a Rancho Dominguez-based manufacturer of cosmetics and 
other personal-care products. "I got a feeling that he had a genuine interest 
in our ideas as to how to grow." Since Drexel became its investment banker in 
1986, Dep's sales and employment have more than doubled, Berglass said. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Broad, a Los Angeles home builder 
and occasional Drexel client. "He had a pretty broad window on the world. He 
must have talked to 200 people a day, so he was a good source of information 
and ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Companies ranging from MCI to Metromedia, from Holiday Inns to Levitz 
Furniture, used Drexel-underwritten bonds to finance growth or takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's a builder; everything he's touched has been the better for it," 
colleague Horowitz said. "These companies didn't have opportunities to raise 
money in the capital markets. Some were in industries that didn't even exist 
before." Entire industry segments, such as health maintenance organizations, 
home building, entertainment and hotels, derived much of their financing 
through Drexel's junk juggernaut, Horowitz notes. 
</P>
<P>
Milken also is described by colleagues as a supportive, although somewhat 
harried, manager. He typically slept only three or four hours a night at his 
Encino home and was at his desk every morning at 4:30, hours that his staff 
often kept as well. He had no office, instead occupying the middle of an 
X-shaped desk where he was constantly on the phone or monitoring his staff of 
more than 100 traders, whom he saw "as his extended family," as one colleague 
put it. Clients or others seeking appointments with Milken sometimes had to 
meet him at unusual times - like 5 a.m. on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Manipulation Claimed 
</P>
<P>
Yet Milken took great pains to be with his family, particularly his daughter, 
who suffers from a form of epilepsy, and his two sons, Horowitz said. This past 
week, pulled away from his family to New York to plan his legal strategies, he 
brought an extra set of his childrens' school books so he could help them with 
their homework, Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the image of Milken as a devoted father and charitable giver, 
federal investigators and critics believe that he built his junk bond empire 
partly on deceit and manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that institutions and individuals may have been pressured 
into buying and selling junk bonds through an incestuous system of favors and 
obligations. Junk bond issuers often were asked to buy junk bonds issued by 
other corporations. Those that did not often found themselves frozen out of 
future Milken deals. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel and Milken defenders say such practices were necessary to maintain 
orderly markets in junk bonds where there were few buyers and sellers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators might have overlooked such practices were it not also for alleged 
illegal activities related to Milken's involvement in corporate takeovers. 
Although takeovers account for only about a fourth of junk bonds issued, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors charge, among other 
things, that Drexel's junk bond operations engaged in an array of securities 
violations, including market manipulation, inadequate disclosure, "parking" of 
securities to hide their true ownership and other infractions. 
</P>
<P>
Milken is expected to be indicted separately on these charges soon, possibly 
this week. And Drexel's expected guilty pleas will not help his defense, a 
situation that Milken supporters at Drexel say amounts to a cold betrayal of 
the man who put the firm on the map. 
</P>
<P>
Repairing His Image 
</P>
<P>
People close to Milken say he is convinced of his innocence and is willing to 
undergo a lengthy trial to prove it. He also feels misunderstood and maligned 
by the public and the news media - but his reluctance to talk to reporters 
reinforced such an image. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Milken has moved in the past year to try to repair his public 
persona. Once totally inaccessible to the media, Milken recently has granted 
interviews, often discussing one of his newer interests: how to solve the Third 
World debt problems by refinancing underdeveloped nations' bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
He also has taken pains to publicize his charitable activities, which ranged 
from taking underprivileged children to baseball games to donating millions of 
dollars to charities. Among his favorite causes: cancer research, youth 
organizations and Jewish community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike always had a vision of being successful and wanting to help others from 
behind the scenes," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet although Milken's spirits are high, the legal pressures have taken their 
toll, colleagues and friends say. "Mike's worked for Drexel for 17 years, he 
never worked anywhere else," one friend said. "Now all that is being taken away 
from him."

'JUNK BOND' KING MILKEN INDICTED FOR STOCK FRAUD 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken, the Drexel Burnham Lambert "junk bond" wizard in Beverly Hills 
who revolutionized U.S. corporate finance and raised funds for dozens of 
corporate raids, was indicted Wednesday on federal racketeering, insider 
trading and other securities fraud counts. 
</P>
<P>
The long-expected indictment also named Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, and a 
former Drexel trader, Bruce L. Newberg. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the racketeering charges, the three could face an astronomical 
amount in financial penalties: The indictment asks that they forfeit a total of 
$1.85 billion, representing their salaries, other compensation and their share 
of Drexel profits, all earned in what the government charges was a continuing 
criminal enterprise operated at the New York-based investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
Fines Could Be Doubled 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the federal racketeering law, known as the Racketeer Influenced 
and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, at least theoretically could subject 
them to twice that amount in fines. This means each defendant could face up to 
$3.7 billion in fines on the two RICO charges. They also face additional fines 
on the other counts totaling in the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken faces a maximum jail sentence of about 300 years, with lesser 
amounts for the other two defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment apparently marks the end of Milken's 20-year career at the firm 
that his junk bond operation transformed from a second-rank investment bank to 
one of the powerhouses on Wall Street. Junk bonds are high-risk, high-yield 
debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the 98-count indictment was returned by a federal grand jury, 
Drexel said that Milken, 42, and his brother, 40, had requested and been 
granted leaves of absence. John Kissick, formerly head of the firm's corporate 
finance department in Beverly Hills, has been expected to take Michael Milken's 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges result from the biggest criminal securities fraud 
investigation ever undertaken by the government. The inquiry has been under way 
for over two years. Benito Romano, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said "this 
specific investigation is continuing" and didn't rule out the possibility that 
additional individuals may be charged soon. 
</P>
<P>
The charges filed Wednesday mean that Newberg is now facing two separate 
racketeering indictments. He is also named as a defendant in an indictment 
returned last July relating to Princeton/Newport Partners, a small investment 
firm that did business with Drexel. The charges against him in the two 
indictments appear to cover the same general chain of events. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Milken, a lawyer, gave up a promising legal career in the 1970s to help 
his brother run Drexel's Beverly Hills office. The indictment charges that 
Lowell "was his brother's principal adviser in the conduct of the conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
Sources at the firm said the indictment of Michael Milken probably would clear 
the way for Drexel to swiftly settle civil charges filed by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Milken's continued presence at the firm was a major 
sticking point in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Settlement with the SEC, in turn, would remove the last obstacle to Drexel's 
carrying out its pledge to plead guilty to six criminal counts and pay $650 
million in financial penalties. The firm had entered into that agreement in 
December, in part to avoid more serious racketeering charges and a possible 
huge forfeiture of assets. 
</P>
<P>
The 110-page indictment returned Wednesday appears to closely follow the civil 
charges contained in an SEC lawsuit filed in September against Drexel and the 
Milkens. It contains only a few charges that weren't in the SEC's complaint and 
leaves out a number that were. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment accuses Michael Milken of a prolonged pattern of insider 
trading, stock market manipulation and defrauding clients. It claims that he 
sought to enrich himself through self-dealing at the same time that he was 
acting on behalf of Drexel's customers. 
</P>
<P>
Areas of Wrongdoing 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges three broad areas of wrongdoing. One involves 
transactions with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who pleaded guilty to 
a single criminal charge and gave prosecutors the information that touched off 
the Drexel investigation. The indictment charges that Milken used Boesky's firm 
to hide illegal stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
The second broad area involves transactions with Princeton/Newport Partners, in 
which Drexel and Milken allegedly helped Princeton/Newport carry out tax fraud 
through sham securities trades with Drexel. Among other charges, the indictment 
alleges that Drexel used Princeton/Newport to illegally manipulate the price of 
COMB Co. securities in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The third general area involves alleged straight insider trading in the 
securities of Lorimar Inc. and Viacom Inc. by Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Although the government could immediately ask a federal judge to freeze the 
three defendants' personal assets, Romano, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said 
he probably will not do that. He said his office has been negotiating with the 
defendants' lawyers and added that he expects a bond to be posted by the three 
men, covering at least a part of the amount they may be required to forfeit to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
Expects Assurances 
</P>
<P>
Romano said he expects to receive written assurances that assets covering the 
rest will not be dissipated before a trial is held. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the huge amounts, among the largest that individuals have been 
asked to forfeit in a RICO case, Romano said the numbers represented "the 
extraordinary levels of compensation and stock ownership in the (illegal) 
Drexel enterprise" paid to Michael Milken and the others. The indictment notes 
that Milken received $1.1 billion in direct compensation from Drexel from 1984 
through 1987, as well as millions in other forms of compensation, and that he 
is Drexel's largest individual stockholder, owning about 6% of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Milken's pay was $123.8 million in 1984 and $135 
million in 1985, then more than doubled in 1986 to $294.8 million. In 1987, he 
was paid $550 million. The indictment says that, during those years, Milken's 
personal compensation amounted to between 28% and 44% of the junk bond 
department's gross revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Milken allegedly received $102 million in direct compensation during the 
same period. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges pending against the 
firm calls for it to withhold nearly all of Michael Milken's compensation from 
1988, as well as about $13 million owed to Lowell Milken. But the brothers are 
challenging that in court as a violation of their constitutional rights, and it 
will be up to a federal judge to decide. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.85-billion total that the three are being asked to forfeit was based in 
part on calculations of how much each of them had received from Drexel. But 
Romano said that, under the law, each of them could be held "jointly and 
separately" liable for the full amount. Michael Milken has been reported to 
have a personal net worth of nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur L. Liman, one of Milken's main defense lawyers, said in a written 
statement that Milken "will plead not guilty with confidence that in a fair 
trial he will be acquitted." Liman said: "The charges against Mr. Milken are 
essentially a repetition of the accusations made by Ivan Boesky and others as 
they bargained for leniency or immunity from prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
Both Milkens strongly denied the charges against them. Michael Milken said in a 
written press release: "I am confident that in the end I will be vindicated." 
Lowell Milken said that "the proof will show that I had virtually no contacts 
with Ivan Boesky, and that I had little, if anything, to do with the events the 
prosecutors misrepresent in order to construct their charges." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "I have been thrown into this indictment because of a fact in 
which I take great pride - I am Michael Milken's brother." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Armstrong, Lowell's lawyer, said in a brief interview that he found 
little that was unexpected in the indictment. "It seems like little more than a 
rehash of what the SEC came out with six months ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another statement, two lawyers representing Newberg accused the government 
of seeking to punish Newberg for refusing to become a prosecution witness by 
indicting him twice on racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The second RICO indictment of Mr. Newberg, containing essentially the same 
charges as those in the first indictment, is a total perversion of the RICO 
statute," the lawyers said. Newberg could not be reached for comment. He left 
Drexel when it became apparent that he was going to be charged in the 
Princeton/Newport case. 
</P>
<P>
Romano said that none of the three would be arrested. Instead, they will be 
allowed to present themselves for arraignment, probably one week from today. 
The government requested that U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood be assigned to 
the case, because she is already presiding over the case in which Drexel is 
expected to plead guilty to six charges. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment conspicuously leaves out a number of names of Drexel employees 
who reportedly have been under investigation. Several of them had received 
"target" letters from prosecutors warning them that they faced indictment. 
Defense lawyers said they believe that the government may file additional 
indictments, or file a new indictment, superseding the one handed up Wednesday, 
that would include more individuals as defendants.

MILKEN RESIGNS DREXEL POST, WILL OPEN SOUTHLAND CONSULTING FIRM 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Junk bond" wizard Michael Milken officially ended his 20-year career at Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. on Thursday and said he will launch his own financial 
consulting firm while he awaits trial on racketeering and securities fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, 42, who has been on a leave of absence from Drexel since March 29, on 
Thursday submitted his resignation. In a telephone interview, he said his new 
firm, International Capital Access Group, would offer a wide range of 
consulting services consistent with his personal interests and his previous 
work at Drexel. He claimed that one purpose of the firm will be to "address the 
major issues in society." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would offer advice on subjects as diverse as the Third World debt 
crisis, helping unions, employees and minorities obtain ownership stakes in 
companies and advising financially troubled companies on how to raise new 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
'Very Emotional Experience' 
</P>
<P>
The timing of Milken's resignation appears to have been influenced by a Supreme 
Court decision last week that cleared the way for Drexel to complete its 
announced plan to settle civil insider-trading and securities fraud charges 
brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement now is 
expected to go into effect within the next few weeks. It requires Drexel to 
terminate Milken's employment and also avoid any direct or indirect business 
dealings with him. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Manella before he 
left in 1978 to help his brother run Drexel's junk bond department. Michael 
Armstrong, Lowell Milken's lawyer, said his client hasn't decided yet where he 
will practice. Lowell Milken was also indicted in March on racketeering 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
During the rare, on-the-record interview, Michael Milken said of the 
resignation: "After spending your whole life working for one company, it's a 
very emotional experience." But in a reference to the investigation and legal 
problems that have beset him, he added, "the last few years have been an 
emotional experience." 
</P>
<P>
Milken said he decided to set up his own firm now because "to continue to help 
(people he has done business with or offered advice to), I need some vehicle to 
be able to help." 
</P>
<P>
'Naturally Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
Milken started out in 1969 as a part-time employee at Drexel Harriman, a 
Philadelphia investment firm that was a precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert, 
while attending the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. 
Within a decade, his pioneering use of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds had 
transformed Drexel from a second-tier brokerage firm into one of Wall Street's 
most powerful investment banking houses. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued Thursday, Milken said: 
</P>
<P>
"Drexel is the only company I've worked for since graduating from college. And 
it's the only one I ever expected to work for. I am naturally disappointed to 
be forced to leave Drexel as part of the firm's settlement with the government, 
but I look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies." 
</P>
<P>
Milken currently faces a 98-count federal criminal indictment. The government 
is also demanding that he forfeit $1.85 billion under the racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, said: "Michael Milken made many important 
contributions to Drexel Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, 
is a sad event." He added: "We wish him well in his new endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
Milken was somewhat vague about exactly what the new firm will do or how many 
people it will employ. His personal spokesman, Ken Lerer, said it would start 
out with fewer than 10 employees. Tentative plans call for it to be based in 
West Los Angeles, and Lerer said it definitely won't be in the Beverly Hills 
building that houses Drexel's junk bond department. Milken, his brother and 
several other partners own that building. 
</P>
<P>
Declined to Speculate 
</P>
<P>
Milken said he isn't currently talking with any of his former colleagues at 
Drexel about coming to work for his new firm, but he didn't rule out that 
possibility. "I just can't tell you at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also declined to speculate on whether he might try to expand the firm to 
offer full-scale investment banking services if he should succeed in overcoming 
the criminal and civil charges facing him. "The financial world changes all the 
time," he said. "Exactly what one would be interested in doing in the future I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Milken's legal problems probably will prevent him from 
competing directly with Drexel, individuals involved in the legal cases said. 
Were he to branch out beyond consulting to underwriting or trading securities, 
he might run afoul of federal and state regulators who supervise the 
registration of securities broker-dealers. But sources said the potential 
exists nevertheless for conflicts with Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC settlement's ban on Drexel doing business either directly or indirectly 
with Milken could be interpreted to mean that Drexel can't do business with 
clients advised by Milken. Milken's lawyers haven't said yet whether they will 
challenge that provision of the settlement in court. If it goes into effect, 
however, it conceivably could force clients to choose between dealing with 
Milken or Drexel. A source close to Milken said: "I think you'd have to take it 
on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Anreder said: "We don't anticipate any conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Milken also declined to say if he might refer clients to firms other than 
Drexel for investment banking services. "I can't predict what's going to happen 
in the future," he said. "We'll see what happens and it will depend on each 
individual situation." 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who earned amounts ranging up to $550 million per year at Drexel, over 
the last year has attempted to help arrange financing for unions and workers 
seeking to take over troubled companies. He also has proposed innovative 
solutions to the Latin American debt problem. Some observers have viewed this 
as part of an overall public relations campaign at a time when he is in 
trouble. But Lerer insists that these are all genuine interests of Milken's and 
that he has been involved in these activities for years. 
</P>
<P>
'More Demands Than Ever' 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Milken's have speculated that one reason he decided to start a new 
firm now is that, since taking a leave of absence from Drexel, he has had an 
unaccustomed amount of time on his hands. They note that Milken typically would 
work from 4:30 a.m. until about 6 p.m. He was used to orchestrating a multitude 
of deals at once. In recent weeks, Milken has given speeches to a variety of 
organizations and worked on his legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Michael is desperate to find something to do," a former Drexel 
colleague said. 
</P>
<P>
Milken himself, however, strongly denied that he has time on his hands. "I have 
more demands on my time than ever before," he said, although he added, 
referring to the legal cases: "Sometimes they're things you'd rather not have 
to spend time on." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lynch, the SEC's director of enforcement, declined to comment Thursday on 
Milken's decision to open a new business. The Milken brothers still face SEC 
civil charges as well as the separate criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, his brother and former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg are likely to go 
to trial on the pending criminal charges sometime early next year. Federal 
prosecutors are expected to bring a new indictment within the next several 
months containing additional charges. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Milken's former colleagues at Drexel already have been granted 
immunity from prosecution and are cooperating with the government 
investigation. Sources confirmed Thursday that another former Drexel employee, 
Reed Harmon, who had worked closely with Milken, was recently granted immunity 
in exchange for testimony before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Charges Denied 
</P>
<P>
Harmon is said to have detailed knowledge of some of Milken's business dealings 
with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky. Boesky, suspected of widespread 
insider trading, pleaded guilty to one criminal count and agreed to cooperate 
with prosecutors. Much of the government's case against Milken involves his 
alleged dealings with Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, Lowell Milken and Newberg all vigorously deny the charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to six criminal charges and pay $650 million 
in penalties under an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. 
The guilty plea would be made after the firm's separate settlement with the SEC 
goes into effect. Lawyers for Michael and Lowell Milken are challenging 
provisions of the settlement agreement, including a requirement that Drexel 
withhold much of the brothers' compensation owed them for 1988. Michael Milken 
is said to be owed at least $200 million.

THE NEW MILKEN; 
THE DEPOSED KING OF JUNK BONDS STILL PRACTICES THE ART OF THE DEAL. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken may be gone from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., but his 
deal-making days aren't done. 
</P>
<P>
On the eighth floor of the United Artists building on North Roxbury Drive in 
Beverly Hills, just a couple of blocks from his old perch on Drexel's junk bond 
trading desk, carpets have been laid, wallpaper is up and furniture delivered. 
Milken's new company, International Capital Access Group, is open for business. 
Despite the racketeering and securities fraud indictment hanging over him and 
his forced resignation from Drexel in June, Milken hasn't retreated to the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
When Drexel's former junk bond chief announced plans for the firm, he said it 
would help members of minority groups and unions raise the capital to own 
companies. And, four months after it was founded, ICAG appears to be doing just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
But the new firm is also gearing up for a considerable amount of potentially 
more profitable business. Since leaving Drexel, Milken has had talks with many 
of his old firm's clients, according to a senior Drexel executive. And in a 
long interview in ICAG's offices, Milken confirmed that a significant part of 
ICAG's business will be with ordinary companies. 
</P>
<P>
It may make direct investments in companies. And it is working on finding new 
capital for successful companies and refinancing firms that are in trouble. In 
exchange for Milken's brainpower and contacts in arranging refinancing, ICAG 
expects to receive an ownership stake in most of the companies that it helps. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at Drexel)," 
in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital, 
Milken says, although he no longer trades or underwrites securities. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, however, protests any suggestion that the firm's main purpose is to 
make money. All of its activities, he says, fall under the category of "helping 
people." He refuses to discuss ICAG's fees or even confirm that he expects the 
company to be profitable. "Financial reporters have this preoccupation with 
money," he says. "We're focused on creating value. Wealth is a byproduct." 
Several times during the interview, the man who earned $550 million in one year 
at Drexel, and is estimated to be worth well over $1 billion, complained that 
"people are so hung up on money." 
</P>
<P>
At Drexel, Milken essentially created the market for high-yield, high-risk junk 
bonds, and he revolutionized the way that capital was raised for medium-sized 
U.S. companies. He also turned junk bonds into a potent tool in corporate 
takeovers and leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Milken seems determined to prove that the government's case against him 
will not stop him from carrying out his ideas. An ordinary person might be 
overwhelmed by the chore of preparing a legal defense against a 98-count felony 
indictment. But Stephen Weinroth, a longtime Drexel official now on leave, 
says: "Mike has an energy level that makes a nuclear plant look pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
In the short time since ICAG was formed, it already has purchased $2.5 million 
worth of barges and other equipment to lease to Unimar International Inc., a 
Seattle-based shipbuilder and tugboat company that was bought out by its 
unionized employees with Drexel's help in 1987. Milken says ICAG plans to do 
this for other employee-owned companies as well, since many of them have 
trouble raising the money to buy equipment outright. 
</P>
<P>
Among activities involving minorities, Milken has put groups of minority 
businessmen in contact with potential backers. And Bill Tatum, publisher of New 
York's black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, says he met with Milken about 
backing for a bid on a major general-circulation newspaper, perhaps the 
troubled Daily News. Milken says that helping unions and members of minority 
groups, and devising ways to help indebted countries, such as Mexico, will make 
up more than half of ICAG's business. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to these areas, Milken already is doing a considerable amount of 
mainstream business. He says he has agreed to help recapitalize an 
entertainment and publishing concern, which he won't identify. He is working on 
bailing out Weintraub Entertainment Group, a Los Angeles company that was 
straining under its junk bond debt after a string of unsuccessful movies. He is 
helping to arrange financing for a Los Angeles chain of car dealerships. And he 
says that enough progress has been made on some deals that they may soon be 
announced publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Milken says that, in all, he has been approached by several hundred companies. 
Of these, ICAG is doing work on behalf of about 30. He says that 12 of these 
already are at the point where a transaction has occurred or is about to. 
</P>
<P>
Milken won't comment on the terms on which ICAG is helping these companies, but 
one deal that fell through suggests that, while his aim may be to help others, 
he isn't neglecting his own interests. Wolfgang Puck, the well-known chef and 
proprietor of the Los Angeles restaurant Spago, said he approached Milken in 
July about raising new financing for Puck's frozen pizza venture, Wolfgang Puck 
Food Co. In an interview, Puck said he wasn't able to come to terms with ICAG. 
Puck said he balked when Milken demanded a majority stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Milken says he wasn't directly involved in the Puck negotiations, and denies 
that they fell through because of the ownership issue. He says Puck's company 
at the time was in financial difficulties and needed a lot of financing. (It 
has since obtained some financing elsewhere.) He says that the talks broke down 
because they involved too many lenders and stockholders who simply couldn't 
come to terms on a variety of issues. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's challenge in establishing a new firm will be to overcome serious 
handicaps imposed by his pending criminal prosecution. ICAG cannot trade or 
underwrite securities. Such activities were a main part of Milken's activities 
at Drexel. But they require licensing by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. From a legal standpoint, Milken could apply for such licenses, 
since he has yet to be convicted of anything. For practical reasons, however, 
he has chosen not to, and so must rely on other firms to perform these services 
for his clients. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it bothers him that he can no longer issue new securities, Milken 
says, "it's not something I'm thinking about at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Investment banking sources say that Milken, in effect, also is closed out of 
doing work for the gambling industry, which made up a big share of his clients 
at Drexel. Because he is under indictment, New Jersey and Nevada gaming 
authorities have indicated that they might take legal steps against casino 
operators who do business with him. 
</P>
<P>
And though Milken's press spokesman and personal lawyer strongly deny it, a 
number of potential clients are frightened of having their names publicly 
associated with him. In an off-the-record interview, the chief executive of a 
publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises 
Milken effusively said that he couldn't afford to have any formal business 
relationship with ICAG. He said the commercial banks with which his company 
does business have indicated that they might stop lending to him if he does. 
Some banks, he said, "have decided that Milken is not a credible person right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
This hasn't stopped a flood of companies that have approached him in 
confidence, however. And there are still plenty of well-known executives who 
praise Milken publicly and wish his company success. Steven J. Ross, 
co-chairman of the recently merged Time Warner Inc., said: "Mike has to be one 
of the most brilliant financial minds of our time." But Ross would not say if 
he expects to use ICAG's services. "We have factors that we never make public 
about any of our business dealings," he said, adding: "That's not to be 
construed that we are or aren't." 
</P>
<P>
In true Milken style, ICAG's new offices are comfortable but not ostentatious. 
Only the firm's name, not Milken's, is on the door. And he refers to everyone 
who works there as co-workers, not employees. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the firm is a long rectangular table made up of 18 wooden desks 
pushed together. Complete with financial data computer screens, it looks 
remarkably like a trading desk. It is an environment that evidently makes 
Milken feel at home; his years in Drexel's Beverly Hills office were spent at 
the center of the junk bond trading desk. But at this one, for the foreseeable 
future, no securities will be traded. 
</P>
<P>
The firm currently has about 20 employees, with more expected to join soon. 
(Milken says he doesn't know how many.) Among the top staff members, whom 
Milken calls "principals," are Steven Fink, a former official at Pacific Asset 
Holdings (a partnership in which Milken holds an interest), Lorraine Spurge, 
formerly one of his top assistants at Drexel, and Randolph Read, former 
president of a merchant banking concern. Officials at the new firm say they are 
aren't making overtures to lure Drexel employees to ICAG. But Milken doesn't 
rule out talking to former Drexel colleagues who may, on their own, contact him 
about a job. 
</P>
<P>
He refuses to discuss how much capital the firm has, a key measure of the 
potential scope of its activities. "It's a private firm," he says. Milken did 
say that all of the firm's capital comes from himself and the principal staff 
members, not outsiders. "There are a number of people who have called, but we 
felt it would be better that we did not take in outside backers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But one clue to the amount of money that Milken personally is committing to the 
firm is how much he says ICAG is willing to invest in an individual 
transaction. For most types of transactions, he says, the firm stands ready to 
invest between $500,000 and $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Co., was established as a corporate takeover 
boutique. In contrast, Milken says, "you will not find us involved in any 
unfriendly transactions." 
</P>
<P>
Although Milken is credited with inventing the use of junk bonds to back 
hostile corporate raids, he maintains that hostile transactions have "never 
been a major focus of mine." Milken adds: "There's so much we can do to help 
people, I just don't think it's something we're interested in." 
</P>
<P>
By "helping companies," Milken means suggesting ways that they could improve 
their basic business, working out creative means of raising capital or 
recapitalizing to reduce interest costs, and using his vast network of contacts 
to put companies in touch with potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
After a speech he made in September, Milken was widely quoted as suggesting 
that companies should now attempt to reduce their level of high-yield debt. 
Some analysts interpreted this as a major reversal, since Milken's later years 
at Drexel were largely spent promoting leveraged buyouts financed with huge 
chunks of junk-bond debt. But Milken maintains that he is simply doing what he 
has always done, advising companies to profit from market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
One service that ICAG expects to perform is finding creative ways for its 
customers to convert their costly high-interest debt into a combination of 
lower-interest debt and equity - that is, stock. Milken says his firm expects 
to help salvage some of the large companies that have been in the news in the 
last couple of months because of severe difficulties in meeting the payments on 
their junk debt. "There are some companies today that aren't knocking the cover 
off the ball, and yes, we are willing to help," he says. Milken declines to 
discuss individual companies but denies that the debt per se caused their 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
As ICAG takes on customers, one thorny issue is its relations with current 
Drexel customers. When Drexel settled a massive SEC lawsuit, the firm agreed 
not to do business "directly or indirectly" with Milken. What this means 
precisely hasn't been defined and could be a source of further SEC action. It's 
not clear, for example, whether legal problems would arise if a company hired 
Drexel to underwrite securities according to a recapitalization plan drawn up 
by Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawyers are interpreting the provision to be Drexel's problem, not 
his. (A Milken adviser notes that Milken isn't a party to the settlement with 
the SEC.) Still, the adviser acknowledges that "it's something that exists, and 
we're conscious of it." 
</P>
<P>
Some current Drexel clients say they wouldn't be troubled by feelings of 
disloyalty if they also decided to seek help from ICAG. Oscar U. Mutz, 
president and chief executive of Forum Group, an Indianapolis developer of 
retirement communities that is a Drexel customer, says: "I don't ask Drexel's 
permission to go see Morgan Stanley (another Wall Street investment bank), and 
I don't ask Drexel's permission to go see Michael Milken or anybody else." 
Mutz, however, says he hasn't yet had occasion to do business with ICAG. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, says the firm hasn't lost any clients to 
ICAG. And he said he doesn't expect conflicts to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, who was one of the most feared competitors on Wall Street when he was 
at Drexel, now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and 
underwriting business that he can no longer do himself. One ICAG staff member 
says Milken's old competitors today are more than happy to do business with 
him, now that he's no longer directly competing. "The reality is that we can 
generate a lot of business for people," the staff member says. 
</P>
<P>
Milken himself takes pains to downplay his former role as competitor, saying 
that as a former buyer and seller of securities, he always had to maintain good 
relationships with other firms. 
</P>
<P>
One big, unanswered question is what will become of the firm if Milken is 
convicted and sent to prison. His trial is scheduled for March, and he faces 
the possibility of a lengthy sentence. He denies any wrongdoing and is 
vigorously fighting the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Milken and staff members say they are hoping for the best and, no matter what 
happens, they expect ICAG to remain in business and grow. Meanwhile, Time 
Warner's Ross says: "He's got such a brilliant mind that I think he could do 10 
things at one time and still prepare for what he's about to undergo."

JUDGE STUNS MILKEN WITH 10-YEAR SENTENCE; 
SECURITIES FRAUD: SHE SAYS THE TERM IS INTENDED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THE 
EX-JUNK BOND KING. SHE IS CONVINCED THAT HE HAS COMMITTED ADDITIONAL SERIOUS 
CRIMES. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge sentenced an apparently stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in 
prison Wednesday after ruling that the crimes he pleaded guilty to were neither 
minor nor isolated. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was by far the harshest imposed in the recent chain of Wall Street 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said the unexpectedly long prison term is 
meant to make an example of the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king, 
whose innovative use of high-yield, high-risk bonds had fueled the corporate 
takeover frenzy of the 1980s. Milken had pleaded guilty to six felony 
securities law violations last April. 
</P>
<P>
But in a jammed courtroom in Manhattan's federal courthouse, Wood said that 
Milken, 44, who has been accused, among other things, of helping to bring on 
the national savings and loan disaster, could not be blamed for all of the 
financial excesses of the 1980s. Wood said she had not made him a scapegoat for 
"the decade of greed." The judge said she based the sentence only on evidence 
of specific crimes presented in court. 
</P>
<P>
Milken family members, supporters and lawyers were plainly shocked by the 
sentence. One close Milken adviser said: "No one could have imagined this in 
their wildest nightmare." Defense lawyer Arthur L. Liman left the courthouse 
without commenting and did not return phone calls later. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's sentence also included three years' probation during which he must 
perform full-time community service. The judge left open the possibility of 
reducing the sentence if Milken cooperates with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Milken could have been sentenced to as many as 28 years. But a number of 
lawyers who had followed the case closely predicted that he would get no more 
than five. A Milken spokesman said that no decision had been made on whether to 
appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
During his own lawyer's presentation before sentence was imposed, Milken at 
times was in tears in the courtroom. He then stood and, choking back sobs, 
said: "What I did violated not just the law but all of my own principles and 
values. I deeply regret it and will for the rest of my life, and I am very 
deeply sorry." 
</P>
<P>
But when the judge read the sentence, he stood rigid and motionless, with what 
appeared to be a look of disbelief when she announced the 10-year term. Wood 
also sentenced him to three years of community service while on probation after 
his prison sentence. Milken and his wife, Lori, did not comment to reporters 
and were permitted to leave the courthouse through a back exit. 
</P>
<P>
Under his plea agreement, Milken was already committed to pay $600 million in 
fines and penalties. Lawyers said he must turn over that amount before the end 
of the year. Because of his huge earnings at Drexel, however, his wealth is 
expected to be at least hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said evidence presented during a pre-sentencing hearing in October 
convinced her that Milken had committed additional serious crimes beyond the 
six felony counts he pleaded guilty to in April. Among them, she said, were 
several acts of obstruction of justice relating to orders or suggestions to 
employees to destroy documents. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also rejected longstanding defense claims that Milken's crimes were 
aberrations by a generally law-abiding man and that they were the result of 
overzealousness to help clients rather than greed. 
</P>
<P>
Wood called Milken "a man of talent and industry." But she said: "This kind of 
misuse of your leadership position and enlisting employees who you supervised 
to assist you in violating the law are serious crimes warranting serious 
punishment and the discomfort and opprobrium of being removed from society." 
</P>
<P>
At Liman's request, the judge agreed to sentence Milken under a provision of 
federal law that allows him to be paroled at any time at the discretion of the 
federal parole commission. Although Milken technically could be paroled almost 
immediately, government lawyers said the commission normally requires prisoners 
to serve close to two-thirds of their sentence. In Milken's case, that would be 
about six years. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence exceeds all others imposed in the series of securities fraud cases 
that grew out of the insider trading case against investment banker Dennis B. 
Levine in 1986. Levine himself got two years. Stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, 
implicated in insider trading on an even grander scale, got only three years. 
Investment banker Martin A. Siegel, who directly stole information from his own 
corporate clients and also received suitcases stuffed with cash from Boesky, 
was let off with only two months. 
</P>
<P>
But in those cases, the defendants had fully cooperated with the government 
before their sentencing, turning in prominent former business associates. 
Milken had not. Under the highly unusual terms of his plea agreement, he is 
obliged to begin cooperating only now that the sentence has been imposed. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said she would consider reducing the sentence if prosecutors 
eventually certify to her that Milken has cooperated fully. 
</P>
<P>
Several lawyers said they interpreted the long sentence as an attempt by the 
judge to ensure that Milken cooperates fully, revealing whatever incriminating 
information he knows about corporate raiders, junk bond buyers and former 
co-workers. Charles Carberry, a lawyer who once headed the U.S. attorney's 
securities fraud unit in New York, said: "I think it was a clear message that 
he should cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor, said the judge may also 
have imposed the severe sentence because Milken occupied a position of trust at 
the center of the financial world. "There's a long tradition here of viewing 
very seriously abuses by people with high responsibilities, and this man was at 
the crossroads of capitalism," Coffee said. 
</P>
<P>
The six counts that Milken pleaded guilty to included conspiracy, securities 
fraud, causing the filing of false information with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, mail fraud and aiding in the filing of a false tax return. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing capped the most massive securities fraud investigation ever 
carried out by the government. Milken, who joined Drexel while still in 
business school in 1969, plucked junk bonds from obscurity and almost 
single-handedly built what at its peak became a $200-billion market. From 
Drexel's junk bond headquarters in Beverly Hills, Milken orchestrated 
transactions that made possible huge leveraged buyouts of such companies as 
Storer Communications and Beatrice Cos. 
</P>
<P>
But as investigators closed in, Milken was forced to resign from Drexel in 
1989, after he was named in a 99-count racketeering indictment and the firm 
itself pleaded guilty to six felony counts. Months later, the junk bond market 
started to collapse. And in February, Drexel was forced into bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's pay at Drexel peaked in 1987 at $550 million. In addition to total 
compensation of more than $1 billion from 1984 to 1988, Milken is believed to 
have received hundreds of millions of dollars from private partnerships he set 
up to benefit himself, family members and employees. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawyers, however, said that Milken's lifestyle was relatively modest 
and unmaterialistic. They noted that he had given much of his earnings to 
charities and that he long had personally worked for them, such as by teaching 
math to abused and abandoned inner-city children. 
</P>
<P>
Liman called Milken "a sensitive human being with a social conscience whose 
offenses stand in sharp contrast to his whole life and to his value system." 
Liman also argued that Milken is "just not cut from the same cloth as Ivan 
Boesky." 
</P>
<P>
The judge did not dispute that Milken had donated much to worthy causes, nor 
that his charitable activities began well before the investigation of him 
started in 1986. But she said that was not enough to make up for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing, Wood disclosed for the first time her findings on the 
unusual pre-sentencing hearings she presided over in October. The so-called 
Fatico hearings were held to determine if there were evidence of additional 
crimes beyond the six to which he pleaded guilty. Under federal court rulings, 
Wood is allowed to consider evidence of other crimes in deciding on a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy written opinion released Wednesday, Wood found that Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys John Carroll and Jess Fardella had failed to prove some of their main 
claims. She said there was insufficient evidence to prove that Milken was 
behind a manipulation of WickesCos. stock in 1986. She said the government also 
did not prove its claim that Milken was guilty of insider trading in Caesars 
World securities in 1983, and also failed to show that he had illegally made 
lucrative investment opportunities available to employees of investment funds 
as inducements to get them to buy riskier securities for their funds. 
</P>
<P>
But she found that Milken had obstructed justice, in part, by arranging the 
destruction of a blue ledger book that showed illegal transactions between 
Drexel and David Solomon, head of Solomon Asset Management. The judge said 
Milken also had made remarks to employees in the Beverly Hills office in 
November, 1986, which could only be interpreted as instructions to destroy 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Co. that he had kept 
extremely valuable warrants in a KKR deal for himself and his family instead of 
selling them to customers. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing, Wood derided defense claims that Milken was basically 
law-abiding and that if he were not, he would have committed more blatant 
crimes, such as insider trading. She said that an equally likely explanation 
was that Milken was simply afraid to do anything too blatant. 
</P>
<P>
"Your crimes show a pattern of skirting the law, stepping just over to the 
wrong side of the law in an apparent effort to get some of the benefits from 
violating the law without running a substantial risk of being caught," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood's sentence was viewed as a rebuff to many prominent Southern Californians 
who had written to her urging that Milken's sentence be limited to community 
service. Among those who had proposed that Milken was suitable for such service 
was Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who suggested that Milken work for 
the Police Department's DARE program, created to help inner-city children. In 
court, Liman had proposed that the judge accept Gates' suggestion. The chief, 
through a spokesman, declined to comment on the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
James Slade, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons, said that under 
Justice Department rules, the 10-year term makes it unlikely that Milken will 
be allowed to serve his sentence in a minimum-security federal prison camp. 
Such camps, where Boesky and others caught up in the Wall Street scandals 
served their sentences, have open rooms instead of cells and offer extensive 
recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Slade said, Milken probably will be sent to a medium-security prison, 
where there will be a higher concentration of street criminals and fewer 
white-collar offenders. He said that in some medium-security prisons, inmates 
are locked in old-fashioned barred cells at night.

THE MILKEN SENTENCING; 
'BEAST OF THE '80S' DESERVES COMPASSION 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite what you may be reading, Michael Milken is not a bloodless monster who 
set out to pillage the world and drown it in a sea of debt. He's a very smart, 
very driven and very flawed human being whose life - and whose life's work - 
has been completely destroyed. Anyone who doesn't feel at least a tinge of 
compassion for the man doesn't have an ounce of compassion in his body. 
</P>
<P>
Milken isn't a symbol of the 1980s, whatever that means. He's just a guy who 
was in the right place at the right time - he started dealing in junk bonds 
when bargains were lying around like truffles on the forest floor - who took a 
good idea much too far. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was that the rewards of owning junk bonds more than outweighed the 
risks of the borrowers going belly up. Milken took it too far by insisting that 
junk bonds - securities that carry high risks and high interest rates - were 
suitable for everyone. Which, in fact, they aren't, as the current crash in the 
junk market - or in what remains of the junk market - shows. 
</P>
<P>
Milken was obsessed with getting more and more people to accept the Gospel of 
Junk, and he almost single-handedly turned junk from a backwater of finance 
into a mainstream investment. Making junk mainstream is what did Milken in - 
and ultimately what did in the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
When the junk market was small and had few players, people had no one to deal 
with but Milken, and he could keep weak borrowers out of the market. Once other 
brokerage houses decided to go after the junk business, Milken's competitive 
juices - and his obsession with controlling every aspect of everything in his 
life - compelled him to do whatever sleazy things it took to nail down 
business. 
</P>
<P>
If junk had stayed a backwater - and if either the enforcers at the Securities 
and Exchange Commission or Milken's alleged superiors at Drexel Burnham Lambert 
reined Milken in - he wouldn't be going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
But the SEC didn't go after Milken until a trail of stool pigeons fingered Ivan 
F. Boesky, who fingered Milken. And instead of supervising Milken, top Drexel 
officials averted their eyes to avoid seeing his sin. In fact, Drexel let 
Milken move the entire junk department from New York City to his native 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's department was making so much money that Drexel Chairman Frederick H. 
Joseph let Milken do whatever he wanted because Joseph needed the 
Milken-generated profits to turn Drexel into a mainline brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
To understand Milken, you have to understand that when he wandered into the 
world of junk bonds at a third-rate Philadelphia brokerage house in the 1970s, 
the junk market consisted of a handful of canny investors who spent their days 
searching through the rubble of financially distressed companies searching for 
securities that were better than they looked. 
</P>
<P>
Because Milken is very smart, has a good head for numbers and could work 
incredible hours, he found more of these little jewels than anyone else did. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he persuaded his bosses to give him enough money to keep an inventory of 
junk around. This meant that when early "junkmeisters" - Saul P. Steinberg of 
Reliance Insurance, Laurence A. Tisch of Loews, Carl Lindner of Penn Central 
and American Financial, to name a few - wanted to buy or sell junk, they had 
to deal with Milken. 
</P>
<P>
But as the market for junk grew larger - mainly because of what Michael was 
doing - Milken wanted to keep all the business. To do that, he financed deals 
that he knew he should never have touched, and he went so far as to offer 
secret goodies to people who had money to invest in junk. That way, he bound 
these people to him. 
</P>
<P>
When the market was small, no one knew or cared what Milken was doing. When it 
got big - and when he began raising money for a band of corporate brigands to 
take over mainline U.S. companies like Gulf Oil and Union Carbide - that was a 
different game. He was used to operating without anyone knowing what he was 
doing, and he didn't understand that the rules had changed, and he had to clean 
up his act. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, being a complicated guy, has conflicting tendencies. On the one hand, 
he lives very modestly and always talks about how important it is not to take 
on airs. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he felt himself smarter than anybody, and thought he could 
indefinitely get away with sleazy things. Such as telling bond issuers that 
bond buyers wanted cheap stock as a "sweetener," then keeping the stock for 
himself and a handful of associates. 
</P>
<P>
During 1987, 1988 and 1989, I spent many hours with Milken, whom I came to 
consider a friend. He was brilliant, but he had no sense of humor and no sense 
of how other people perceived him. He didn't blame himself for his problems, he 
blamed the news media. And probably still does. 
</P>
<P>
Milken has lost almost everything that he holds dear. He used to pride himself 
on being a quiet donor of huge amounts to charity and of working, unheralded, 
with disadvantaged children. But he decided to let his public relations people 
turn charity into a PR show. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Loan of Beverly Hills, First Executive Corp. of Los Angeles - are busto, 
and many others, such as Lindner and Steinberg - seem to be in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
He prided himself on his staff's loyalty to him - but many of them turned 
state's evidence. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Milken broke down and cried several times Wednesday, it was far too 
late for him to be considered a human being. He was sentenced as the Beast of 
the '80s, but he will suffer as a man. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Milken still has a vast fortune. But his life and work are in ruins, and 
he will spend who knows how many years in the slammer while his kids grow up 
and leave home. Even though he brought it on himself, watching how this man has 
destroyed himself is enough to make me want to cry.

<P>
To hear some shareholder attorneys talk, Michael Milken's
next appearance should be in federal bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders and other investors have filed so many suits
against him, seeking billions of dollars, that even a fortune
as big as Mr. Milken's may be vulnerable, the attorneys say.
Attorneys for Mr. Milken dismiss the suggestion as absurd
and say Mr. Milken's potential liability won't be nearly so
extensive. While some shareholder attorneys routinely file
multimillion-dollar suits whenever a takeover is announced or
the market drops, the suits against Mr. Milken seem to be
much more likely to succeed than most.
</P>
<P>
Consider:
- Mr. Milken's guilty plea to six felony counts Tuesday
makes it impossible for him to claim in civil cases that he
was guilty of no market fraud. In each case, the former junk
bond impresario will be viewed as a convicted felon.
- So much evidence against him has already been gathered
by federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, much of which will eventually become available to
shareholder lawyers, that plaintiffs' attorneys will have to
do relatively little sleuthing of their own.
- While Mr. Milken didn't plead guilty to any
racketeering counts, recent court cases have made it
increasingly easy to show a so-called pattern of racketeering
in civil cases. Shareholders have sued Mr. Milken under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, and RICO
damages are automatically tripled.
- The SEC's funds to compensate victims of market
wrongdoing by Mr. Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
convicted abritrager Ivan F. Boesky, while stocked with more
than $600 million, cannot be used to pay tripled damages or
punitive damages. Thus, any judgment against Mr. Milken above
mere compensatory damages would have to come out of his own
pocket. Drexel was Mr. Milken's former employer. The
securities firm has filed for bankruptcy-court protection.
</P>
<P>
All of this sounds like good news to Richard Greenfield,
one of the nation's top shareholder lawyers. As he eagerly
scanned the early wire reports of the plea Tuesday, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Greenfield said Mr. Milken should seriously contemplate
filing for bankruptcy-court protection. "It's a very real
possibility," said Mr. Greenfield, who has filed several
cases against Mr. Milken. "If I were in his shoes, I'd want
to start over on Day One. By the time he's out of jail, it's
all over."
Steven Rosenfeld, an attorney for Mr. Milken, says there
are "no plans whatsoever" for his client to seek
bankruptcy-court protection. The partner in the New York law
firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind Wharton 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Garrison says there is
"nothing particularly remarkable" about the allegations in
the lawsuits. "There is a word processor somewhere that spews
out the same . . . allegations," Mr. Rosenfeld says. "I view
that as a plaintiff tactic."
As his partner Arthur Liman said the day before, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeld said the Milken camp believes the $400 million Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken is required to provide the SEC for civil restitution
will more than cover any legitimate claims.
</P>
<P>
Still, the Milken team faces a morass of suits. One of the
most sweeping, filed last month in Los Angeles by
shareholders of Unocal Corp., accuses Mr. Milken, Drexel and
many major takeover artists of the 1980s of a massive
conspiracy that defrauded shareholders in takeover targets.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenfield's firm filed the suit along with plaintiff
lawyer William S. Lerach of the shareholder law firm of
Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie and Lerach. It alleges a
back-scratching arrangement by which Mr. Milken teamed up
with high-profile corporate raiders to manipulate stock
prices in huge acquisitions. The suit, which seeks $2.3
billion in trebled damages, claims that more than 70
defendants violated the RICO law.
</P>
<P>
Under the alleged arrangement, Mr. Milken shared "secret
information with market operatives" and backed the takeover
attempts of such raiders as Carl Icahn, Ronald Perelman, T.
</P>
<P>
Boone Pickens and others. According to the allegations, a
raider would typically tell Mr. Milken he wanted to take over
a particular company, and Mr. Milken would then issue junk
bonds for the raider's companies and arrange for other
raiders to buy the bonds. The raiders felt obligated to buy
the bonds because they wanted Mr. Milken to fund their future
takeover attempts, the suit says. Meanwhile, at Mr. Milken's
direction, arbitragers would purchase big blocks of stock in
the target company with guarantees against loss provided by
Mr. Milken, the suit claims.
</P>
<P>
While the Unocal suit claims enormous damages to
shareholders, a suit filed by Mr. Greenfield's firm in
February may be even broader. The firm sued on behalf of at
least 10,000 class members who purchased high-yield,
high-risk bonds underwritten by and sold through Drexel. They
charged that the junk bond market was rigged, that prices
were artificially determined and that without Mr. Milken to
act as "puppeteer," the market fell apart. Action in this
case is stalled for procedural reasons.
</P>
<P>
Also pending are a multitude of civil cases lodged in the
past three years against Mr. Boesky, Drexel, Mr. Milken and
others that accuse the defendants of insider trading, stock
manipulation and other securities law violations. Many of
these cases are pending in federal court in New York, where
pretrial fact-finding has been slowed because of the
unavailability of Mr. Boesky, Mr. Milken and others to
testify at depositions. Thus far, federal prosecutors have
gotten the judge to deny the plaintiffs' lawyers access to
these witnesses while criminal investigations are being
pursued. But at some point, such a partial stay will
presumably be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Finally, a sprinkling of cases across the country target
Mr. Milken among many other defendants in cases alleging that
savings and loans associations and other companies suffered
losses because they purchased large portfolios of Drexel's
junk bonds as part of back-scratching arrangements with Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken.
</P>
<P>
The strength of the plaintiffs' various charges are
difficult to gauge. Mr. Greenfield likens them to the
asbestos cases that led to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court
filing of Manville Corp., the giant asbestos manufacturer. He
says he believes that once one case "breaks through" to
trial, Mr. Milken will have no choice but to start settling
the rest of the cases.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for Mr. Pickens's Mesa Petroleum Co., a
defendant in the Unocal case, calls the allegations "silly
stuff. They've taken any name that's appeared next to
Boesky's or {Boyd} Jefferies's. . . . They're throwing names
in the soup and alleging a scheme that is pure nonsense." Mr.
</P>
<P>
Jefferies, a former brokerage firm chief in Los Angles
pleaded guilty to two felony counts of breaking securities
laws in April 1987.
</P>
<P>
Says attorney James Conroy, commenting on behalf of Revlon
Group Inc. Chairman Mr. Perelman and his MacAndrews 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Forbes
Holdings Inc., "The suit casts a net very broadly and names a
lot of people in the process. We don't belong there because
there is no basis in fact for the allegations."
A civil case is always easier to prove than a criminal
case because the civil plaintiff doesn't have to prove his
charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead he must show only
that the accusations are more likely than not to be correct.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the plaintiff's lawyers agree that winning a
trial against Mr. Milken wouldn't be easy.
</P>
<P>
"It can't be proven by a handful of witnesses and a
handful of documents," says Mr. Greenfield. Instead, the
lawyers must attempt to show juries patterns of trades in
which prices appear to be rigged and raise the issue of how
the securities were priced. The defendants, says R. Bruce
McNew, a partner in Mr. Greenfield's firm, "have to have an
innocent explanation for what they've done. In the process of
proving your case, you then take apart their explanation."
Alan Bromberg, a law professor at Southern Methodist
University, says showing a chain of bond purchases doesn't
necessarily prove that Mr. Milken was in control of the
sellers and buyers, "but it does permit that inference." The
outcome of the case will depend on whether the jury believes
there was a conspiracy or the sellers and purchasers of bonds
made independent judgments.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bromberg and others assert that Mr. Liman, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken's principal lawyer, negotiated to make the plea
agreement narrow enough so that little of what Mr. Milken
admitted to can be used against him in the civil suits. "I
suspect they fought hard on that, and my guess is they were
pretty successful at it," Mr. Bromberg says.
</P>
<P>
However, a little-noticed provision in the plea agreement
could prove to be invaluable to civil plaintiffs. Prosecutors
extracted a promise from Mr. Milken that he wouldn't attempt
to block them from including in their sentencing memo many
additional charges of wrongdoing to which he didn't plead
guilty.
</P>
<P>
Recently Robert Freeman, former Goldman, Sachs 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co. head
of arbitrage, successfully blocked inclusion of such broader
allegations in the government's sentencing memo. Thus, the
government's full case against Mr. Freeman, who had pleaded
guilty to just one insider trading charge, was kept from
public view.
</P>
<P>
In the Milken case, however, prosecutors are expected to
outline a broad scheme of alleged wrongdoing, involving a
wide range of companies and securities. Those charges could
be exceedingly helpful to plainitffs lawyers building civil
cases against him.
</P>
<P>
Realistically, it's highly unlikely that the civil cases
against Mr. Milken will ever go to trial. Most shareholder
cases are settled, and Mr. Greenfield says he has had only
two jury trials in the past six years, while handling scores
of suits.
</P>
<P>
One reason for this is that plaintiffs' lawyers typically
don't charge hourly rates. Instead they charge their clients
for a percentage of the settlement or jury award, generally
20% to 30%. Therefore, it is often to their benefit to
dispose of cases as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
But settlements work only if both sides believe they are
making a fair compromise, considering what the damages might
be if the case went to trial. And, in the Milken litigation,
settling so many high-stakes cases could be a long and tricky
process in itself.

Ivan Boesky may have been the most feared man on Wall
Street in January 1985, but he jumped during a Friday morning
staff meeting when his secretary interrupted to say, "Mike's
on the phone." Everyone in the room knew that "Mike" was
Michael Milken, the junk-bond impresario at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s Beverly Hills office. He was the only person
who always got through to Boesky. Mr. Boesky put his fingers
to his lips and looked around the table, ordering silence.
</P>
<P>
Then he picked up the phone. There were no pleasantries. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Boesky himself said little, mostly indicating agreement with
whatever Mr. Milken was saying. When he hung up, his eyes
were gleaming with excitement. "We're putting all engines on
max," Mr. Boesky exclaimed to his assembled traders.
</P>
<P>
He ordered his staff to buy as much stock of Diamond
Shamrock as possible, while selling short Occidental
Petroleum, betting that Diamond Shamrock would rise in price
and Occidental would fall. The Boesky staff was baffled.
</P>
<P>
Neither stock had been on their research or trading lists
that morning. What had Mr. Milken told Mr. Boesky?
</P>
<P>
In fact, the night before, Drexel Burnham Lambert's West
Coast office had been told confidentially that Occidental
Petroleum Corp. and Diamond Shamrock planned to merge in a
stock swap that would probably cause Diamond Shamrock's stock
price to rise and Occidental's to fall. Since Drexel was
being retained by Occidental, Drexel's traders were barred by
law and firm rules from trading in the stock. But that didn't
stop Mr. Milken, a man so powerful that he seemed omniscient.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Boesky's staff members weren't the only witnesses to
the phone call. Mr. Milken's top salesman, James Dahl, was
sitting next to Mr. Milken at the trading desk when Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken called Mr. Boesky, and listened as Mr. Milken issued
the trading orders and he and Mr. Boesky refined their
strategy to capitalize on the still-secret information.
</P>
<P>
Unknown to Mr. Milken, this was the conversation overheard on
Mr. Boesky's end by his traders. And, in fact, under a secret
arrangement, Mr. Milken and Mr. Boesky owned the positions
50-50.
</P>
<P>
Even now, after pleading guilty to six felonies, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken insists that he never engaged in insider trading. His
spokesmen deny the account reported here, which is based on
numerous interviews, including eyewitnesses, and review of
sworn testimony. As these previously unreported details show,
Diamond Shamrock looks like a brazen example of Mr. Milken's
and Mr. Boesky's joint insider trading.
</P>
<P>
But the scheme proved star-crossed. The following Monday,
Diamond Shamrock's board unexpectedly rejected the deal. Told
of the development, Mr. Milken grabbed the phone, called Mr.
</P>
<P>
Boesky and, as Mr. Dahl again listened, practically screamed:
"The deal didn't go through. We've got to get out of the
position."
In New York, Mr. Boesky was apoplectic, frantically
ordering his head trader to unload the positions before the
news became public. But it was too late; the ticker soon
carried the news of the scotched deal, and every arbitrager
was trying to dump Diamond Shamrock. Over the next day Mr.
</P>
<P>
Boesky's traders struggled to contain the loss. Mr. Milken
screamed at Mr. Boesky for taking too long to get out of the
positions. Mr. Boesky screamed at Mr. Milken for getting them
into the mess. When it was all over, Mr. Milken brooded at
his desk. When Mr. Dahl asked what the matter was, Mr. Milken
incautiously explained that he had a position "off-line" with
Mr. Boesky and that the deal's collapse had just cost them
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
Even though the conspirators lost money (insider trading
is a crime whether money is made or lost), the trading set
the stage for Wall Street's most sweeping criminal conspiracy
since the passage of the securities laws - in which crimes
of far greater reach than insider trading would become
routine.
</P>
<P>
What follows are major, newly revealed episodes from
history's biggest insider trading scandal. Because most of
the major players, including Mr. Milken and Mr. Boesky, ended
up striking deals with the government that allowed them to
plead guilty to relatively technical and minor-sounding
crimes, the true scope of their misdeeds has never been
publicly documented.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Milken's crimes alone were massive: systematically
robbing clients by trading on their confidential information
for his own gain, manipulating securities prices to force
deals on which he could make huge fees, gouging unsuspecting
clients on junk-bond trades, and in at least two cases,
taking for himself, his relatives and a few Drexel colleagues
securities meant for his customers.
</P>
<P>
This story also shows, for the first time, how the
government brought the criminals to justice. One government
agent posed as a blackmailer in order to trick a key member
of the insider-trading ring to confess his crimes. It shows
how Mr. Milken's lawyers and public relations advisers tried
to manipulate potential witnesses and the press, and it
reveals that Mr. Milken actually tried to plead guilty a year
before he finally did so. But his plea was rejected by
prosecutors because it came less than an hour after the
deadline they had set.
</P>
<P>
As their power grew and the volume of their deals
skyrocketed, Mr. Milken's band of traders and salesmen
headquartered in Beverly Hills took on a superhuman aura - a
tight-knit group working 16-hour days under extreme pressure
and loving every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the ruthless quest for profits set by Mr. Milken
in Beverly Hills was debilitating. Head trader Warren Trepp
began smoking four packs of cigarettes a day. Bruce Newberg
started taking blood pressure medicine. One day Mr. Newberg
raved hysterically when his phone line went dead during an
important client call. It turned out Mr. Newberg had chewed
through the cord. Another employee, Gary Winnick, complained
he was developing a brain tumor and other serious ailments,
though he remained healthy. Cary Maultasch developed
psychological problems, began seeing a psychiatrist, and
asked to be transferred to Drexel's New York office.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Milken set the tone, badgering traders for not
squeezing the most out of a trade, hectoring employees who
tried to leave after only 12 hours of work. When Mr. Dahl
told Mr. Milken he was leaving early one day after learning
his mother had cancer, Mr. Milken's only response was, "When
are you going to be back?" Even when Mr. Milken himself
briefly keeled over at his desk on the trading floor in 1981,
his brother and co-worker Lowell came over, viewed the
unconscious body, and simply returned to his office. The
message was clear: Keep working.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1982, Mr. Milken was making $45 million a
year, but his aides were struck by how obsessed he was with
enhancing his wealth and power. Chatting with Mr. Winnick one
day, Mr. Milken looked at the view across Century City and
West Los Angeles to the coast and asked, "What do you think
it'd cost to buy every building from here to the ocean?"
Once Mr. Milken discovered how his vast network of
junk-bond buyers could be harnessed to hostile takeovers, he
told his colleague Mr. Trepp in a tone of grim determination
that "We're going to tee up GM, Ford and IBM, and make them
cringe."
</P>
<P>
THE JUNIOR PARTNER
Mr. Boesky was the ideal partner in crime. For despite his
fearsome reputation, he had neither Mr. Milken's market
acumen nor his access to funds. Like so many of the clients
that accepted Mr. Milken's millions, Mr. Boesky became
dependent. Drexel was supplying most of his financing - and
charging him a whopping 17% interest.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Boesky exhibited his own eccentricities, especially
when the subject was food. When he met stock trader John
Mulheren for the first time at a dinner party at Manhattan's
elegant Cafe des Artistes, Mr. Boesky was asked for his
order. "I'll have every entree," Mr. Boesky said. The
waiter's pen stopped in midair. Mr. Boesky repeated, "I'll
have every entree." When the food arrived, the waiter had to
wheel a table next to them. On it were that day's eight
featured entrees. Mr. Boesky circled the table, looked them
over closely, and took one bite of each. He selected one, and
sent the rest back.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Boesky ran his office with an intensity similar to Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken's. When Mr. Boesky took a rare day off, he harassed
his employees with calls to ensure that everyone else was
still there working. He had remote control television
installed in the office so he could watch each employee from
his own control panel. Mr. Boesky's head of research, Lance
Lessman, once complained to Mr. Boesky's son, Billy, that
"Your dad's really been beating up on me." "Seriously
understand my father," Billy said in a somber tone. "He is
stark raving mad."
When Mr. Milken enlisted Mr. Boesky in his schemes, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Boesky was predisposed toward crime. He was already trading
illegally on secret information from one of Wall Street's
brightest young stars, Martin Siegel. The Kidder Peabody
investment banker seemed to have it all: a beautiful wife, a
spectacular Connecticut oceanfront estate, glowing press. But
Mr. Siegel came to feel he couldn't live on his earnings of
more than half a million dollars a year. The Connecticut
house had cost $750,000. His wife needed full-time help with
their baby. Their Manhattan apartment was too small, and what
they considered an appropriate one would cost another $1
million. He was haunted, irrationally, by the bankruptcy of
his father.
</P>
<P>
So Mr. Siegel convinced himself that he needed to provide
Mr. Boesky with inside information. The payoff would be cash
delivered by an Iranian courier who, Mr. Siegel came to
learn, always seemed to skim something off the top.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the payoffs went smoothly. On two occasions Mr.
</P>
<P>
Siegel met the courier in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel. After
the courier gave the Boesky-dictated password - "red light"
- and Mr. Siegel responded, "green light," the briefcase
containing the cash, neatly tied in Caesars Palace casino
ribbons, was handed over.
</P>
<P>
But in 1985, Mr. Boesky decided he didn't want to risk
another handoff in the Plaza lobby. He told Mr. Siegel to be
at a phone booth on 55th and First Ave. precisely at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Siegel would pick up the receiver and pretend to be
making a call. While he was on the phone, the courier would
stand behind him as though he were waiting to make a call. He
would place a briefcase by Mr. Siegel's left leg, then
disappear.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Siegel arrived at the pay phone early on the appointed
date. To kill time, he sat down at a table in the window of a
coffee shop across the street. As he sipped his coffee, he
spotted someone who had to be the courier: a swarthy man
wearing a black peacoat.
</P>
<P>
Then Mr. Siegel saw someone else. About a half-block up
the street, he spotted another dark-skinned man keeping an
eye on the man Mr. Siegel suspected was the courier. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Siegel started to panic. What was going on? Suddenly all of
Mr. Siegel's fears about Mr. Boesky's reputed ties to the
C.I.A. came to the fore. "They're going to kill me," Mr.
</P>
<P>
Siegel thought. He fled.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Boesky called him later that day. "How did it go?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing went," Mr. Siegel answered. "There was more than
one person there."
"Of course," said Mr. Boesky. "There always is. I want to
make sure they deliver." Mr. Siegel was amazed that Mr.
</P>
<P>
Boesky didn't trust his own courier. Mr. Boesky insisted that
Mr. Siegel repeat the exercise at the phone booth. This time
the plan went without a hitch, and Mr. Siegel collected that
year's "bonus" of $350,000.
</P>
<P>
But the frightening experience caused Mr. Siegel to pull
away from Mr. Boesky, and eventually to stop giving him
inside information. His attention was increasingly absorbed
by his efforts to use insider trading profits to prop up a
faltering Kidder Peabody. To this end, he launched an even
broader insider trading scheme with Goldman, Sachs 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co.
partner and chief arbitrager Robert Freeman.
</P>
<P>
While Mr. Freeman would later plead guilty to a single
count of insider trading and his defenders would go on to
vigorously assert his innocence and mistreatment by
overzealous prosecutors, Messrs. Freeman and Siegel stole
information from their firms and their clients to trade
illegally on numerous deals. These included; Champion
International's bid for St. Regis paper; Kohlberg, Kravis
Roberts 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co.'s purchase of Beatrice Cos.; and T. Boone
Pickens's raid on Unocal. As Mr. Freeman once cynically joked
to Mr. Siegel: "I've got to hand it to you. You really know
how to trade information."
</P>
<P>
MAJOR LEAGUE CRIME
For the Milken/Boesky team, insider trading was a mere way
station toward bigger goals and bigger crimes. They were
willing, for example, to lose money on their insider trading
when a broader goal was sought. In 1984, when Milken client
Stephen Wynn of Golden Nugget Inc. found himself stuck with a
big position in MCA, Mr. Milken simply directed Mr. Boesky to
buy MCA shares until he had driven up the price sufficiently
that Mr. Wynn could sell his stake at a profit. There is no
evidence that Mr. Wynn knew of this illegal arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Boesky lost money selling his own shares, of course.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Milken now owed Mr. Boesky $10 million. Paying him with
something so simple as a check was out of the question: It
would create a paper trail, and, more important, it would
cost Mr. Milken money. Instead, Mr. Milken would get his own
junk-bond customers to pay.
</P>
<P>
He directed Mr. Boesky to buy junk bonds from Milken
clients, sell them back to Drexel at inflated prices,
generating profits for Mr. Boesky. Then Drexel would convince
other clients to buy the bonds at even higher prices. Some of
the clients weren't smart enough to realize what was
happening; others simply owed Mr. Milken for the many favors
he did for them. In less than six months, Mr. Milken repaid
Mr. Boesky more than $10 million. And in doing so, he
generated further trading profits for his own operation.
</P>
<P>
The double threat of Milken information and Boesky buying
power may have reached its apogee with the 1985 takeover by
Drexel client Maxxam Group of Pacific Lumber. Pacific Lumber
was gearing up to resist, but then Mr. Boesky started buying
the company's shares on Mr. Milken's orders. Mr. Milken, of
course, was privy to Maxxam's confidential plans, including
the price it would ultimately be willing to pay. As usual,
Mr. Milken shared ownership of Mr. Boesky's positions and
promised to cover any possible losses. Mr. Boesky's SEC
filings, of course, made no mention of Mr. Milken's secret
interest.
</P>
<P>
Maxxam raised its offer, and, feeling under pressure from
two raiders, Pacific Lumber capitulated. Mr. Milken's scheme
netted Drexel more than $20 million in fees and generated
over $1 million in insider trading profits on the stock owned
jointly by Messrs. Milken and Boesky. Pacific Lumber under
Maxxam control soon aroused the ire of conservationists by
felling tracts of redwood forest to meet its junk-bond
payments.
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Milken's most lucrative ploy may have been his
taking Beatrice Cos. warrants in connection with the
leveraged buy-out of the company by KKR. Mr. Milken had
extracted the warrants (the right to buy Beatrice stock at a
low price) from KKR by arguing that he needed to offer them
to clients as an inducement to buy the Beatrice junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Mr. Milken kept almost all the warrants for Drexel,
lodging the bulk of them in his and his family's
partnerships. The warrants eventually proved to be worth an
estimated $650 million.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Milken's Beverly Hills colleagues believed they were
all sharing in the profits generated by the high-yield
department, both in their bonuses and through interests in
investment partnerships set up by Mr. Milken. Mr. Milken
refused, however, to give details of the partnerships. One
day, Gary Winnick called Jim Dahl into his office and said,
"I'm going to show you something that will make you sick."
Mr. Winnick had gotten a master list of the partnerships. It
showed that while most Milken deputies had an account, there
were more than 40 accounts for Mr. Milken, his wife, his
children and other relatives. In total, Mr. Milken had
created more than 500 investment partnerships. One of them,
named Otter Creek, paid out an astounding total of $473.4
million, most of it to Mr. Milken and his family members. And
that was just one of the partnerships.
</P>
<P>
But no amount of money, legal or illegal, seemed to be
enough for Mr. Milken. At the end of 1986, Drexel allocated
$700 million in bonus payments to Mr. Milken's high-yield
department. Under his arrangement with Drexel, Mr. Milken was
free to allocate those payments to himself and his
colleagues. Most of his employees thought Mr. Milken was
generous with them. They had no way of knowing that that
year, Mr. Milken kept $550 million - nearly 80% of the total
- for himself.
</P>
<P>
Even that wasn't enough. The year before, Mr. Milken felt
that Drexel Chief Executive Fred Joseph had cheated him on a
finder's fee. Mr. Milken agreed that another department also
deserved credit, but argued that his personal contact with
the client had locked up the deal. Mr. Joseph disagreed and
refused to give Mr. Milken the money. He thought the matter
was over. But now, a year later, Mr. Milken again complained
about the fee. He called Mr. Joseph repeatedly, arguing
strenuously for hours about this one fee. In a year when he
had just made $550 million (not counting the Beatrice
warrants and other earnings), and when a conservative
estimate of his net worth and that of his family would be $3
billion, Mr. Milken never stopped griping that he had been
cheated. The amount in dispute: $15,000.
</P>
<P>
BEFORE THE FALL
As he careened from triumph to triumph, Mr. Milken seemed
to change. He had always eaten lunch on paper plates out
among his colleagues, but by 1986 he was telling caterers to
serve him on china and he often ate alone. He obtained an
expensive new toupee, began wearing French-cuffed shirts,
bought a half-interest in a Gulfstream jet, hired a bodyguard
and began arriving for work in a chauffeured limousine.
</P>
<P>
Still, by the standards of clients like Mr. Boesky, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken was an ascetic. In the summer of 1986 Mr. Boesky was
hardly ever in his office. He was often in Europe at his
place on France's Cote d'Azur. Other times he was at his $1.2
million Paris apartment, his London apartment, his condo in
Hawaii, or in his own suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
</P>
<P>
But even Mr. Boesky outdid himself one Saturday in
September 1986. The Queen Elizabeth II had just left
Manhattan on a celebratory "cruise to nowhere" for the bar
mitzvah of real estate developer Gerald Guterman's son. The
QE II's entire staff of more than 1,000 had been hired. Peter
Duchin and his orchestra were playing. Clowns entertained on
board. Suddenly, guests began craning their necks skyward as
a twin-engine helicopter hovered over the ship and landed on
its helipad. With the blades still turning overhead, an
elegantly clad Mr. Boesky, dressed in black tie, flashed a
smile as he disembarked to laughter and applause.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter was owned by Mr. Boesky's friend Mr.
</P>
<P>
Mulheren, and when the pilot reported to him, Mr. Mulheren
was furious. The next day he got on the phone to Mr. Boesky.
</P>
<P>
"Don't ever use my helicopter again for a stunt like
this," Mr. Mulheren said. "Are you out of your mind?
</P>
<P>
Revolutions are made of this. People get put in gas ovens."
Mr. Boesky just chuckled. "You've got to admit one thing,
John. When I go, I go first class."
The next day, Sept. 17, 1986, Mr. Boesky surrendered to
federal authorities and became an undercover agent for the
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
WHEN A STRANGER CALLED
The call came early one October evening in 1986. Martin
Siegel had left Kidder Peabody for Drexel, and had just
returned from his new office to his Upper East Side
apartment. "Is this Marty Siegel?" a voice on the phone
asked. After identifying himself only as Bill, the caller
asked, "Did you get my letter?"
"No," Mr. Siegel replied. "I don't know anything about a
letter." He thought he should just hang up, but something
held him. "Why don't you tell me?" Mr. Siegel asked.
</P>
<P>
Then the voice dropped its bombshell. "I mean, your
relationship with the Russian."
Mr. Siegel closed his eyes, only to see an image of Mr.
</P>
<P>
Boesky - the Russian. He struggled to sound unconcerned, but
he had to cut this off. "Don't bother me anymore. If you do,
I'll go to the police."
"I doubt that," Bill replied sarcastically, and Mr. Siegel
hung up.
</P>
<P>
He reeled away from his desk. "So this is how it all
ends," he screamed. When his wife rushed in moments later,
she found her husband slumped over the toilet in the
adjoining bathroom, vomiting.
</P>
<P>
The next day, on the advice of his lawyer, Lawrence
Pedowitz, Mr. Siegel drove to his Connecticut home where he
found the letter. It said simply, "I know," and asked for
money to keep the writer from turning Mr. Siegel over to the
Internal Revenue Service. The next week, Mr. Siegel got a
curious call from Mr. Boesky anxiously seeking a meeting, and
then an IRS agent stopped by Mr. Siegel's office while he was
out. Mr. Siegel was growing increasingly unnerved.
</P>
<P>
So at Mr. Siegel's request, Mr. Pedowitz contacted the
U.S. Attorney's office. Mr. Pedowitz summoned Mr. Siegel to
his office the next morning. "The U.S. Attorney knows all
about the letter," he told Mr. Siegel. "They know all about
you and Boesky." Mr. Siegel put his head in his hands and
began to cry. "I did this," he said.
</P>
<P>
He quickly agreed to cooperate with the government, which
wanted him to try to ensnare his former Kidder Peabody
arbitrage colleagues, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor.
</P>
<P>
Investigator Thomas Doonan was assigned to work with Mr.
</P>
<P>
Siegel in an undercover capacity. The two always met in
person, but one day Mr. Doonan called him on the phone for
the first time. Mr. Doonan's voice, isolated on the phone,
sounded eerily familiar. Suddenly Mr. Siegel felt a chill. He
was transported back to an October night, to his bedroom,
where he had answered the phone.
</P>
<P>
"Is this Marty Siegel?" the voice had asked, ruining Mr.
</P>
<P>
Siegel's life. "Did you get my letter?"
Mr. Doonan was "Bill."
</P>
<P>
THE COVER-UP
Mr. Milken and his traders were winding down a busy week
in Beverly Hills one Friday afternoon in November 1986 when
salesman Terren Peizer shouted, "Oh, my God." The
electrifying news of Ivan Boesky's guilty-plea arrangement
had just crossed the ticker.
</P>
<P>
All eyes turned to Mr. Milken. He showed no reaction.
</P>
<P>
After three or four phone calls, he jumped up and headed for
brother Lowell's office, where he remained for more than an
hour.
</P>
<P>
That weekend, Jim Dahl was summoned by Mr. Milken into the
office. Mr. Milken walked silently into the men's room,
turned on the tap water full blast and said, "There haven't
been any subpoenas issued. Whatever you need to do, do it."
Cary Maultasch, Mr. Milken's representative in Drexel's
New York office, was summoned as well, and booked a flight
immediately for Los Angeles. When he arrived, he was taken to
Mr. Milken. "You don't know anything about the $5.3 million
payment," Mr. Milken said flatly. But Mr. Maultasch did know.
</P>
<P>
The payment was the money Mr. Boesky had owed Mr. Milken when
they finally decided to settle the books on their illegal
trading arrangement. Mr. Maultasch was dismissed, but Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken scheduled another meeting with him for 4 a.m. the next
day.
</P>
<P>
When Mr. Maultasch arrived he was escorted into a
conference room where Mr. Milken sat alone, a guard standing
at the door. Mr. Milken spoke in hushed tones and frequently
wrote his questions on a yellow legal pad rather than
speaking. He erased the questions once they were answered.
</P>
<P>
The questions all concerned the illegal arrangement with Mr.
</P>
<P>
Boesky, which Mr. Maultasch had helped Mr. Milken track.
</P>
<P>
When Mr. Milken wanted to discuss a specific stock, he
used his pen to point at the stock's name on a list, never
mentioning the name aloud. When Mr. Maultasch left the
office, he returned his entry pass to a Drexel security guard
who tore it up. "Don't worry," the guard said. "You weren't
here."
Later, even after Mr. Milken had received his subpoenas,
Mr. Milken sat down next to Mr. Peizer, the salesman, as Mr.
</P>
<P>
Peizer was going through his files. "What are you doing?" Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken asked. "Complying with a subpoena," Mr. Peizer
responded. Mr. Milken opened his own file drawers. They were
empty. "If you don't have any documents," Mr. Milken said,
"you can't comply."
Mr. Milken's defense strategy was set at the outset by
lead counsel Edward Bennett Williams, the famed Washington
criminal lawyer: "We have to remain on the inside {of the
tent} pissing out." Potential witnesses had to stay loyal to
Mr. Milken. To bring this about, Mr. Milken's lawyers found
other lawyers to represent potential witnesses whose
cooperation they thought they could count on. Thus, a key
potential witness like Mr. Dahl ended up retaining Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken's own firm, Williams 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Connolly.
</P>
<P>
Even though Drexel was paying Mr. Milken's legal fees, the
Milken defense team, which also included noted New York
lawyer Arthur Liman, decided not to cooperate with Drexel and
its lawyers even while saying publicly that they were working
together. Mr. Williams believed from the start that Drexel
would fold under the pressure of a massive government
investigation. So Drexel's lawyers weren't allowed to
interrogate Mr. Milken, even though Drexel's chief executive,
Mr. Joseph, sent them out to California to get to the bottom
of the Boesky allegations. Most companies would fire so
uncooperative an employee, but Drexel did nothing. Thus, when
Drexel kept insisting publicly that it could find no evidence
of wrongdoing, it was hopelessly ill-informed.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Liman suggested that the Milken camp also retain
public relations expert Linda Robinson, wife of American
Express Co. Chairman James D. Robinson III, who had achieved
prominence herself with numerous high-profile clients like
RJR Nabisco Chairman Ross Johnson. Her colleague, Ken Lerer,
and some associates soon sat down with Mr. Milken to ask the
financier what he considered his principal achievements. The
PR-staffers would then build their campaign around them. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken took a legal pad and red flair pen and began to write,
citing his achievements: that he won a dance contest in
elementary school and was prom king in high school. He
stopped without mentioning Drexel. Some of the participants
rolled their eyes at the realization that portraying Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken as a national treasure would indeed be a tough
assignment.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lerer soon began placing pro-Milken tips with favored
journalists, "breast feeding" them, as he once called it. The
Robinson firm began writing pro-Milken op-ed pieces that were
then signed by Milken clients. The whole effort was
enormously lucrative for the Robinson firm, which demanded a
$150,000-a-month retainer and often exceeded it in actual
billings. The possibility that Mr. Milken might be guilty
wasn't even allowed to be discussed inside the Robinson firm.
</P>
<P>
One afternoon, employee David Gilman, who worked on the
Milken account, was conferring with Mr. Lerer when Mrs.
</P>
<P>
Robinson marched into Lerer's office and sprang what staffers
came to call the "loyalty test."
"Is Milken innocent or guilty?" she demanded.
</P>
<P>
"Innocent, of course," Mr. Gilman replied. Mrs. Robinson
didn't look satisfied, so he repeated, "He is innocent," with
more conviction.
</P>
<P>
"Right," Mrs. Robinson answered, then stalked out of the
room.
</P>
<P>
THE TENT BLOWS OPEN
Two big breaks for the prosecutors helped topple the
strenuous defense efforts of Mr. Milken's handlers.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors working on the Robert Freeman case had gathered
records of a New Jersey firm called Princeton-Newport that
had done business with Mr. Freeman and Goldman Sachs. They
found some suspicious trading by one employee, whom they then
learned had been fired. The former employee, Will Hale, was
subpoenaed and questioned. The interrogation was getting
nowhere. Mr. Hale was evasive and reluctant. Then prosecutors
asked what seemed an innocuous question: Why did he leave
Princeton-Newport? Mr. Hale hesitated only slightly before
answering, "I didn't leave. I was fired." Why? he was asked.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't stand all the crimes they were committing."
Mr. Hale detailed a series of securities crimes and said
Princeton-Newport's principal conspirator was none other than
the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors went on to seize audio phone tapes that
implicated several Drexel employees, including Milken aide
Cary Maultasch, who, learning he was under suspicion, soon
dismissed his attorney out of fear that he was "in Milken's
pocket." Mr. Maultasch began negotiations with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Attorney's office and became a cooperating witness.
</P>
<P>
Another major break came soon after Milken aide Jim Dahl
was notified he was about to be indicted. All along, Mr. Dahl
had known he had something to hide. At Mr. Milken's
direction, he had helped client Columbia Savings 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Loan evade
taxes through phony trades. Now Mr. Dahl began to question
the loyalty of his lawyer, Robert Litt, whose firm also
represented Mr. Milken. Mr. Dahl requested a new lawyer, but
when he came to believe that Mr. Litt was stalling, he hired
two new lawyers of his own.
</P>
<P>
When Mr. Dahl's new defense team examined the evidence
against him, Mr. Dahl was relieved: The suspicious trades
being examined by the government had his initials on the
order tickets, but he hadn't done them. One of the trading
tickets actually had the initials M.M. at the bottom. He
recognized the orders as trades in stocks for Ivan Boesky.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Dahl only handled bonds, and knew that Mr. Milken himself
handled Mr. Boesky's trades.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Dahl immediately went to his old lawyer, Mr. Litt,
still working for Mr. Milken, and told him "I didn't do the
trades, Mike did." Would Mr. Milken sign an affidavit that
Mr. Dahl didn't do the trades? A week later the answer came:
Mr. Milken wouldn't sign or acknowledge anything. Mr. Dahl's
own trading assistant, still on Mr. Milken's payroll, said
she suffered a memory lapse; she didn't remember anything
about the trades, so she couldn't back up Mr. Dahl. Soon, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Dahl was convinced that he was becoming a fall guy for Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken. His lawyers approached the U.S. Attorney's office and
asked for immunity. The "tent" so carefully erected had blown
open.
</P>
<P>
Several other Drexel aides would soon follow Mr. Dahl into
the government camp. Even as his lawyers claimed the
defections didn't matter, the news hit Mr. Milken hard. After
testifying before a grand jury, Mr. Dahl was in New York when
he received a call from Mr. Milken. He was in Washington, and
if Mr. Dahl met him there, the two could fly back to Los
Angeles together in Mr. Milken's plane. Mr. Dahl, eager for a
reconciliation with his mentor, accepted. But as the flight
started, Mr. Milken said virtually nothing to Mr. Dahl. He
then selected a movie, "Raiders of the Lost Ark," and turned
up the sound so loud that Mr. Dahl's ears hurt.
</P>
<P>
"Mike, if we're not going to talk, will you at least turn
that thing down?" Mr. Dahl asked. But Mr. Milken didn't
respond. He didn't even look at Mr. Dahl, nor did he speak to
him for the duration of the flight. The message sank in. To
Mr. Milken, Mr. Dahl had ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
ADMISSION OF GUILT
By late 1988, having heard the Princeton-Newport tapes and
other evidence, Chief Executive Fred Joseph had ceased to
believe in Mr. Milken's innocence. That meant Drexel was
guilty, too. Mr. Joseph traveled to the office of Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken's lead attorney, Arthur Liman (Mr. Williams having
died that summer), to explain his painful decision to have
the firm plead guilty and dismiss Mr. Milken. He was shocked
at the reception he received.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Liman compared Mr. Joseph's decision to the Nazi
persecution of Jews. He argued that Mr. Joseph was depriving
Mr. Milken of his rights prior to trial. "That's the first
step towards concentration camps," Mr. Liman said. "No man
can deprive another of his freedoms." Mr. Joseph was too
shocked to counter Mr. Liman's charges, but he insisted his
mind was made up. "Mike did what he did," Mr. Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not here to try Michael Milken." Almost as an
afterthought, he added, "Mike is going to plead guilty
anyway."
This really aroused Mr. Liman's indignation. "Never," he
said firmly, showing Mr. Joseph to the door. "Absolutely
not."
Mr. Joseph's next stop was Milken partisan Donald Engel,
the man behind Drexel's infamous Predator's Balls.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Mr. Joseph left his office, Mr. Liman
placed a call to Mr. Engel. "Donny, he's selling him out,"
Mr. Liman reported. So Mr. Engel was ready for a fight when
Mr. Joseph arrived at his apartment.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Milken is "our brother," Mr. Engel insisted. "You've
got to fight. A mafia lawyer wouldn't act like this."
"We're not a mafia company," a weary Mr. Joseph replied.
</P>
<P>
THE FALL
Despite the Milken team's repeated denials, plea
bargaining was soon under way. By March of 1989, prosecutors
had put an offer on the table for Mr. Milken: plead guilty to
just two felonies in return for immunity for his brother
Lowell. Their deadline for a response was 3 p.m., March 29.
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, prosecutors gathered in their office to await
the call from Mr. Milken's forces. The grand jury was waiting
nearby in the courthouse. Expecting their client to plead
guilty, Williams 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Connolly's Mr. Litt had planned a trip to
Disney World and Mr. Liman was planning to go to France that
very day. But as the day wore on, Mr. Milken hadn't decided.
</P>
<P>
He wasn't even taking calls from his own lawyers. Finally,
Mr. Litt got through to Mr. Milken. "I can't decide," Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken said. "I've got these concerns. . . ."
The deadline passed without a response from Mr. Milken.
</P>
<P>
Still, the government waited. A press conference to announce
the indictment was scheduled for 4 p.m., then canceled.
</P>
<P>
Finally, a breathless Mr. Liman reached acting U.S. Attorney
Benito Romano from a pay phone at New York's Kennedy
International Airport and said, "He's ready to reach an
agreement."
"I'm sorry," Mr. Romano responded after a brief pause.
</P>
<P>
"It's too late."
Mr. Milken had made his worst trade ever. He was indicted
that day on 98 counts. He later pleaded innocent and asserted
publicly for a year that he would be acquitted. But
prosecutors had the advantage all along of knowing what the
public didn't - that Mr. Milken had already admitted guilt.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Milken's guilty plea, this time to six felonies, came
a full year later. On Nov. 21, 1990, federal district court
Judge Kimba Wood sentenced Mr. Milken to 10 years in prison
- two years each on five of the six counts, with the
sentences to run consecutively.
</P>
<P>
Many in the courtroom gasped as the sentence was read, but
Mr. Milken showed no reaction. When the Milken entourage had
gathered in the corridor outside, the heavy door to the
courtroom was closed. Mr. Milken had still said nothing. Then
he turned to Mr. Liman. "How much did I get?" he asked, as if
he hadn't heard Judge Wood. "Two years?"
There was a moment of stunned silence. Apparently Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken thought he was being sentenced to concurrent rather
than consecutive sentences. Mr. Liman broke the news. "Ten
years, Michael," he said gently. "The sentence is 10 years."
The blood drained from Mr. Milken's face. He took his wife
Lori's arm and the two disappeared into a small witness's
waiting room off the corridor, closing the door behind them.
</P>
<P>
Moments later, first Lori, then Mr. Milken, emitted
bloodcurdling screams. Milken lawyer Richard Sandler burst
into the room as Mr. Milken collapsed into a chair,
hyperventilating. "Oxygen]" someone yelled, as a federal
marshal raced for help.

Irreconcilable Differences
Everyone named in this article was interviewed or was
asked for an interview and given an opportunity to comment.
</P>
<P>
To a surprising degree, differences that emerged in various
accounts were reconciled during further interviews.
</P>
<P>
The one major exception occurs between Mr. Milken's
assertions of fact, and Mr. Boesky's. The reporting found
that Mr. Boesky's version was consistently more accurate.
</P>
<P>
After making his plea agreement, Mr. Boesky's only obligation
was to tell the truth; indeed, his plea bargain would be
revoked if he lied.
</P>
<P>
In contrast - and in striking departure from usual
Justice Department practice - Mr. Milken's plea bargain
isn't revocable even if he now lies. He didn't testify under
oath, even at his presentencing hearing when given the
opportunity to do so, and during the investigation he
repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the following is an effort to convey Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken's position, largely set forth in court filings
responding to government charges, as well as the positions of
others who dispute aspects of this story.
</P>
<P>
Diamond Shamrock: Mr. Milken has repeatedly denied
engaging in insider trading. He has insisted that he
committed no crimes other than the six to which he pleaded
guilty. When given the opportunity to respond to allegations
of insider trading in Diamond Shamrock and other stocks, his
lawyers said only that if Mr. Milken had been routinely
insider trading with Mr. Boesky, Mr. Boesky wouldn't have
needed to trade illegally with Dennis Levine.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Milken's Fainting Spell: Lowell Milken's attorney says
his client attended to his brother and called an ambulance
for him.
</P>
<P>
The Siegel/Freeman scheme: Mr. Freeman has denied engaging
in any criminal activity other than the one instance of
insider trading with Mr. Siegel to which he pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Freeman has apparently denied other specific alleged
instances in a presentencing memorandum, but at his request,
this document has been sealed. The Wall Street Journal has
filed suit to obtain the report; the litigation is pending.
</P>
<P>
MCA/Golden Nugget: This was the subject of Count Three of
Mr. Milken's plea agreement. But while admitting crime, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken has insisted that the subsequent purchasers of MCA
stock were victims only of Mr. Boesky's rush to sell, not of
their mutual scheme.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Lumber: In response to these allegations, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawers said, "It is obviously impossible for us to
refute . . . each and every transaction which Boesky now
claims was tainted with illegality."
Liman/Joseph discussions: While acknowledging having a
wide-ranging philosophical discussion, Mr. Liman has denied
comparing Mr. Joseph to the Nazis.
