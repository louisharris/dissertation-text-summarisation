Vincennes Veterans: The Fortunes Of War Play Out A Tragic Error
</HL>

<DATELINE>VINCENNES, Ind. (AP)

<TEXT>
<P>
The USS Vincennes' destruction of an
Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its
captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake
organization said Sunday.
``On the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the
captain acted the best way he knew how,'' said William E. Brooks
Jr., publisher of the Vincennes Sun-Commercial newspaper and a
member of the USS Vincennes Association.
</P>
<P>
The association is made up mostly of men who served on the two
ships of that name during World War II. The current USS Vincennes
is the fourth naval vessel to bear the name of this southwestern
Indiana city.
``The other thing, in my opinon, this is the other side of the
Stark incident,'' Brooks said, referring to the May 1987 Iraqi jet
attack on the U.S. missile frigate Stark, which cost 37 American
lives.
``If the captain had stayed there and not done anything, we
might have been reading about loss of life on the Vincennes,''
Brroks said.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iran Air jet shot down
was a commercial Airbus carrying 290 people from the Iranian port
of Bandar Abbas to Dubai. The news agency said all aboard were
presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. missiles were fired by USS Vincennes, an Aegis
class cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles.
</P>
<P>
The current 9,600-ton Vincennes was the third in a new class of
guided missile Aegis-type cruisers and was christened April 14,
1984, at Pascagoula, Miss., and commisioned on July 6, 1985.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of Vincennes.
</P>
<P>
The first was commissioned in 1826 and assigned to service in the
Pacific. It was decommissioned in 1867.
</P>
<P>
Association member Gene Thurmond, 65, of Evansville, served on
the second USS Vincennes, a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and
sunk by Japanese cruisers in 1942.
</P>
<P>
A light cruiser named for Vincennes was commissioned in 1944 and
received six battle stars for service in World War II before it was
decommissioned in September 1946.
</P>
<P>
Thurmond said he met the captain of the newest ship, Capt. Will
C. Rogers III, at an association meeting in Vincennes in August.
``I met the skipper last summer and he's a real captain and
level-headed and I think he did the proper thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The association's 500 members meet annually in Vincennes to
reminisce about their years of service and pay tribute to the dead,
said Vincennes liaison officer and honorary member, Bill Toth, 64.
</P>
<P>
Members of the association were considering a tribute to the 290
people who were killed.
``There's no way of rectifying this kind of situation, so all we
can do is remember these people,'' Toth said. ``Our prayers and
those of the commuity are with the ship's commander and crew
members.''
``From what I've heard about the ship, it's like everybody on it
is family and they're trying to be the best in the Navy,'' Toth
said. ``But, as this incident shows, that can be good and bad.''
``It's a hard situation today. Until all the knews came in it
was hard to really understand what happened over there,'' said
Toth. ``We have such a close tie to the ship and its personnel, we
regret the situation that happened as far as the civilians
involved.''
``But the captain defended the ship and did what he thought was
best for the personnel,'' he added.

Here are excerpts of the speech to the
Security Council on Thursday by Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati
of Iran, delivered in Farsi and translated by the Iranian Mission:
In the morning of Sunday July 2, 1988, families and friends of
290 passengers and crew said farewell to their loved ones in Tehran
and Bandar Abbas airports _ unaware of the dastardly attack that
awaited them, unaware of the tragic destiny that would be imposed
upon them by a reckless and incompetent naval force led by
aggressive and expansionist policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
According to the transcript of the communication between the
pilot and Bandar Abbas tower, before permission for takeoff was
granted the tower asked the pilot to make sure that his transponder
was turned on. Positive response from the pilot was received.
</P>
<P>
The plane was flying on a scheduled flight using the
internationally established and published Amber 59 airway that is
used at least 14 times a week, five of which between the same two
airports. The plane was then climbing to the prescribed altitude at
about 320 knots per hour.
</P>
<P>
Seconds after the last communication between the plane and the
tower, the plane was targeted by two surface-to-air Standard guided
missiles from USS Vincennes, the most technologically sophisticated
naval ship. ... The plane ws shot when it was at the center line of
Amber 59 airway.
</P>
<P>
USS Vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as
American officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the
target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from Bandar
Abbas to Dubai.
</P>
<P>
Another story which was fabricated to misguide the international
public opinion was the claim by the United States that the airliner
was not transmitting the appropriate signals.
</P>
<P>
Adm. Crowe claimed on July 3, 1988: ``There were electronic
indications on Vincennes that led it to believe that the aircraft
was an F-14.''
Notwithstanding the fact that the Iranian air force had no F-14
operations in the morning of that unfortunate Sunday in or around
the Strait of Hormuz, it may be noted that the military experts
well-familiar with F-14 and its capabilities have held that F-14
could not have presented any serious danger to the USS Vincennes or
any surface target for that matter.
</P>
<P>
F-14 fighters, as it should be known most vividly to the
Americans who made them, are designed for air-to-air attack and not
air-to-surface operations.
</P>
<P>
Possibly the most fallacious argument of the American officials
in justifying their inexplicable crime was a claim that the
airliner did not respond to the alleged warnings issued by the
warship.
</P>
<P>
While every available evidence including the transcripts read
earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any
warning, many have contended that in such a short and routine
flight, the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency
civilian frequency.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, because the ship failed to identify the target of
its alleged warnings, the pilot of the airliner of a scheduled
flight should not have reasonably taken it as directed against
himself.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the most awkward American explanation for shooting down
a civilian airliner was presented by Adm. Crowe, who claimed that
the plane was coming onto the USS Vincennes in a war zone, while
descending and increasing speed of 450 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to note that the area where the plane was
attacked is well outside the declared war zones of the combatants.
</P>
<P>
This fact is attested to even by Lloyd's of London.
</P>
<P>
The question that needs to be asked is why a warship had
positioned itself right at the center of a civilian airway.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, positioning itself right in the middle of an
international civil airway, it is ironic that the ship expected the
plane to go outside of the corridor, not be coming onto the
Vincennes.
</P>
<P>
All available evidence suggest(s) that the shooting down of an
Iranian civil airliner ... could not have been a mistake. Certainly
the huge difference in appearance, size, weight, and flight pattern
between an Airbus and those of an F-14, whic is almost a fourth of
the former, would make any claim of mistaken identity absurd.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the course of events during that day clearly shows that
the U.S. warships in the area had clear aggressive intentions,
which resulted in the massacre of 290 innocent people.

<P>
U.S. military experts left the Persian
Gulf on Thursday after a 3{-week investigation of the destruction
of an Iranian airliner by an American warship, Navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
The team led by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty arrived July 5, two
days after missiles fired by the cruiser USS Vincennes hit an Iran
Air Airbus flying over the Strait of Hormuz, killing all 290 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said officers of the Vincennes mistook the
Airbus A300 for an Iranian F-14 jet fighter on an attack course.
</P>
<P>
Fogarty's team worked in secret and made no statements before
leaving.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy officials said the report would ``work its way up
the chain of command'' to Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. Because
Carlucci is in the Soviet Union until about Aug. 8, they said, the
report could not be released until mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Investigators compiled data from computer tapes on the Vincennes
and two other U.S. warships that were in the area, the frigate USS
Elmer Montgomery and missile frigate John H. Sides.
</P>
<P>
They also took sworn testimony from the commander of the
Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, and other officers of the
three warships.
</P>
<P>
An initial 15-day deadline for the investigation was extended at
Fogarty's request.
</P>
<P>
The Navy officials would not give details of the investigations
and said contact with Iran for information would have to be through
diplomatic channels. The Vincennes has been assigned to the Arabian
Sea, just outside the Persian Gulf, and is expected to complete its
tour at the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, Iranian diplomat Gholamreza Behtashi said a
five-member team from the International Civil Aviation Organization
is expected to arrive Friday in Tehran, Iran's capital, to pursue
its own investigation into the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Behtashi, third secretary at the Iranian Embassy, said the team
is made up of technical personnel from the Montreal-based United
Nations agency.
``They will go from Tehran to the Persian Gulf and investigate
the various aspects of the incident,'' Behtashi said.
</P>
<P>
Iran asked the governing council of the agency to meet in
special session to condemn the attack, but members refused to
censure the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 33-nation governing council ordered the inquiry on July 14.
</P>
<P>
U.S. delegate Edmund Stohr said the United States will offer the
investigating team whatever help it can. He said the team had not
asked to board the Vincennes, and he didn't know if such a visit
would be possible considering the military situation in the gulf.

<TEXT>
<P>
A five-man U.N. team arrived in the
Iranian capital of Tehran today to investigate the downing an
Iranian jetliner by a U.S. warship. American experts wrapped up
their probe in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The International Civil Aviation Organization team planned to
start its probe at Tehran international airport, where part of
Iran's air traffic control network is based, said Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The group from the Montreal-based U.N. agency planned to travel
to Bandar Abbas airport in southern Iran, from which the Iran Air
Airbus took off on a brief scheduled flight to Dubai on July 5.
</P>
<P>
Iran says all 290 aboard were killed after the plane was hit by
missiles from the cruiser USS Vincennes. Pentagon officials said
officers of the Vincennes mistook the Airbus A300 for an Iranian
F-14 jet fighter on an attack course.
</P>
<P>
The ICAO experts also will go to the area where the plane
crashed into the sea near the Iranian island of Hengham in the
Strait of Hormuz, the Iranian agency said in a dispatch monitored
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The experts will stay in Iran for a week, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The team is in Iran at the request of the Iranian government to
help resolve discrepancies in accounts given by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team left the gulf Thursday after spending 3{ weeks in
the region, Navy officials said. The team led by Rear Adm. William
M. Fogarty arrived July 5, two days after the disaster.

Psychologists Say Military Needs To Better Understand Stress
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Psychologists who studied the downing of an
Iranian civilian airliner in the Persian Gulf say the military
needs to better understand stress and should spend more on
psychological research and improve its crew training.
</P>
<P>
The judgment of the Navy cruiser crew that mistakenly shot down
the Iranian plane July 3 was clouded by misconceptions caused by
stress, the psychologists said.
``There is much knowledge about how decisions go wrong and how
they can be improved that is not being put to use in military
decision-making,'' Dr. Paul Slovic, a psychology professor from the
University of Oregon, told a House panel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Steven Zornetzer, representing the Navy's office of naval
research, responded that the service does try to consider stress
and is spending $12 million a year on basic research into
psychological questions. Another $18 million is being spent to
apply the results of that research to Navy programs.
</P>
<P>
While progess is being made, he said, ``it must be clearly
recognized that these research problems are among the most
difficult and complex in the entire research spectrum.''
The hearing by the House Armed Services policy subcommittee was
part of the panel's examination of the destruction of Iran Air
Flight 655 that killed all 290 people on board. It was shot down by
the cruiser Vincennes in the mistaken belief that the commercial
jetliner was a military plane diving toward the Vincennes.
</P>
<P>
A Navy investigation attributed the incident to stress-related
mistakes made by the crew of the Aegis-class cruiser, one of the
Navy's most sophisticated warships.
</P>
<P>
The Navy said crew members, under battle-caused stress after
just finishing a firefight with Iranian gunboats, misread or
misinterpreted a variety of electronic data from the Aegis
computers.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the panel, said,
``Misinterpretations of data provided by the Aegis weapon system
and chaotic communications in the command center have pointed up
troubles with man's ability to make fast, accurate decisions in
combat.''
Dr. Richard Nisbett, a psychology professor at the University of
Michigan, noted that the Vincennes crew was on alert for an attack
by Iranian planes. The crew members interpreted the data to see
what they expected to see, he said.
``Expectations can color what people think they see, and what
they remember, to a far greater degree than is recognized by common
sense,'' Nisbett said.
``Magicians and card sharks have long made a living on this
principle, and in the last 30 years or so psychologists have
learned a great deal about the scope of the principle in daily life
events,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Nisbett also noted the example of the USS Stark, which was hit
by an Iraqi missile in May 1987, killing 37 seamen. Top officers on
the Stark were disciplined for not firing their weapons against the
Iraqi plane, and Navy ships in the region were on a high state of
alert after that.
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes crew wanted to avoid another incident like that
involving the Stark, Nisbett said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Helmreich, a psychology professor at the University
of Texas, said the Vincennes crew members didn't communicate among
themselves well enough.
``The communications problems evident in the Vincennes incident
closely parallel those uncovered in analyses of the causes of
crashes in civilian and military air transport,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard W. Pew said another risk arises from the highly
automated, computerized nature of modern warships like the
Vincennes.
``Research is badly needed to understand when and just how much
automation to introduce in situations where the ultimate control
and responsibility must rest with the human operators,'' he said.

15 Vincennes Sailors Disciplined for Drug Use
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy announced Friday that 15 crew members
of the USS Vincennes, the cruiser that shot down an Iranian
jetliner in the Persian Gulf last summer, will be disciplined for
drug abuse.
``There is no connection now to the July 3 incident in the
Persian Gulf to what has happened on board the Vincennes,'' said
Navy Cmdr. David Dillon, spokesman for Pacific Fleet Surface Force
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes, meanwhile, will be shifted to Long Beach Naval
Shipyard within five weeks for modifications to correct
deficiencies in the Aegis electronic combat control system, The
(San Diego) Tribune reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aegis, which would enable a ship like the Vincennes to make
computer-recommended battle decisions for entire fleets, was found
flawed in the Persian Gulf confrontation.
</P>
<P>
According to Pentagon analysts, split-second decisions were
affected by the inability of radar-scope interpreters to
immediately match the plane's ``blip'' with digital direction,
altitude and speed information displayed on another screen.
</P>
<P>
Those problems are one reason the Vincennes will undergo
modernization, an unidentified source told The Tribune.
</P>
<P>
None of the sailors involved in the drug sweep were in positions
that may have influenced the decision by Capt. Will C. Rogers III
to fire two anti-aircraft missiles at the jetliner, Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
All 290 aboard the plane died.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 sailors, six are being processed for discharge from
the Navy, while six others have been given warnings, Dillon said.
``Three are petty officers who are being investigated for
possible court-martial in connection with drug sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Dillon noted that the 15 sailors represent 3.9 percent of the
384 sailors on board. ``That is less than the 5.4 percent average
for the entire Navy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as preparations were under way at the
Naval Station San Diego for Saturday's change of command aboard the
Vincennes.
</P>
<P>
Rogers will be rotated to a new assignment at the Navy's
Tactical Training Group in San Diego. The new Vincennes commander
is Capt. Robert B. Lynch, who had been stationed in Washington,
D.C., and is assuming his fifth sea command.
</P>
<P>
Rogers and his wife, Sharon, have been under guard by the Naval
Investigative Service since a pipe bomb exploded under the family
van Mrs. Rogers was driving to her teaching job March 10 in La
Jolla. She escaped injury.
</P>
<P>
The FBI is investigating the attack as possible terrorist
retaliation for the airliner's destruction.

Families Of Airbus Victims Sue Radar Manufacturers, Designers
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 relatives of
people killed when a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian airliner a
year ago have sued the makers of the ship's radar system, a
spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nagib Ghafoor said the suit was filed June 28 in U.S. District
Court in San Francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 of the 290
victims.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the lawsuit came on the eve of the July 3
anniversary of the 1988 tragedy, when an Iran Air Airbus was shot
down by the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Vincennes crew members said they mistook the airliner for an
Iranian F-14 fighter coming in to attack.
</P>
<P>
The jetliner was on a commercial flight from the Iranian city of
Bandar Abbas, where a large air base is located, to Dubai in the
southern United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Ghafoor said the lawsuit was filed against the General Electric
Corp. ``and other entities which designed and manufactured the radar
equipment on board the USS Vincennes.''
</P>
<P>
GE is based in Fairfield, Conn. ``The company has not seen the
suit yet, so it's inappropriate to comment,'' said Jack Batty, a
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers aboard the ill-fated Airbus were Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon analysts have said split-second decisions aboard the
Vincennes were affected by the inability of radar operators to
immediately match the plane's radar trace with digital direction,
altitude and speed information displayed on another screen.
</P>
<P>
Ghafoor said the complaint charged that the radar equipment
indicated the aircraft approaching the Vincennes was an F-14, diving
in an attack mode at an altitude of 4,000 feet, rather than the Iran
Air flight, which was climbing.
</P>
<P>
He said claims against the United States on behalf of the
families ``are in the process of being filed as well.''
The Iranian government has been seeking a World Court verdict
against the United States and demanded financial compensation for
the 290 dead.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention any figure for the compensation sought but
said the group would be guided by the amount of compensation the
Iraqi government paid the families of American sailors killed in an
Iraqi air strike on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf on
May 16, 1987.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis said the ship was hit because the pilot of a Mirage
fighter-bomber mistook it for an Iranian warship.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has agreed to pay $27.3 million to the families of 37 U.S.
crewmen killed aboard the Stark, meaning each family would receive
around $740,000.
</P>
<P>
The United States had asked for $29.6 million for the families,
along with an unspecified amount for 21 sailors wounded in the
incident.

Commander Says Vincennes Tragedy Was Avoidable
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A naval commander who had observed the USS
Vincennes in the Persian Gulf said the ship had ``no good reason''
for shooting down an Iranian civilian airliner, killing all 290
aboard.
</P>
<P>
The unusually candid article by Cmdr. David R. Carlson in the
U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings magazine this month said others had
remarked on the agressive behavior of the Vincennes, which had been
dubbed ``robo cruiser.''
Carlson, commander of the USS Sides, a frigate that was on the
scene when the USS Vincennes shot down the Airbus on July 3, 1988,
clearly put the blame on actions taken by the ship and disputed any
notion of self-defense.
``No profit has come from the pathetic postincident attempts to
place the blame on the victims,'' he wrote. ``View it as you will,
Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down for no good reason.
``Having watched the performance of the Vincennes for a month
before the incident, my impression was clearly that an atmosphere of
restraint was not her long suit. Her actions appeared to be
consistently aggressive, and had become a topic of wardroom
conversation.''
Capt. Will Rogers, skipper of the Vincennes at the time, said
Carlson's assessment was subjective and not in line with the Navy's
conclusions.
``The Navy investigated the events of July 3, 1988, in
excruciating detail and published its findings in the Fogarty
Report,'' Rogers said in a statement issued by the Navy in San
Diego, where he is stationed.
``Commander Carlson's comments in the magazine article are his
personal opinions of the Airbus incident,'' he said. ``I fully stand
behind the Navy report and the performance of my crew.''
Navy spokesman David L. Dillon in San Diego said that the
magazine is not part of the Navy.
``It's published by the Naval Institute, a private self-supported
non-profit professional society and it's a forum for people to
express personal opinions and assertions in various articles related
to Navy issues, but the Naval Institute is not part of the U.S.
government, so his comments are his own personal opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Carlson suggests the crew of the Vincennes wanted to prove the
capability of the ship's Aegis missile-defense system in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
On the day of the incident, Carlson said, a crewman informed him
that the Vincennes had classified the plane as an Iranian F-14
fighter.
``I was also prepared to deal with an air threat, but in all
honesty did not perceive one,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
According to Carlson, the event started with the Vincennes'
helicopter drawing fire from Iranian speedboats, which he claims
were only warning shots.
``The Vincennes saw an opportunity for action, and pressed hard
for Commander Middle East Force to give permission to fire,''
Carlson said.
``The tragedy was avoidable, and we must learn from it,'' he said.
``A review of the facts is in order,'' Carlson wrote. ``When the
decision was made to shoot down the Airbus, the airliner was
climbing, not diving; it was showing the proper identification
friend or foe ... The Vincennes was never under attack by Iranian
aircraft.''
A naval investigator told Congress last September that a series
of errors caused by stress, including misinterpreting electronic
data, caused the mistaken attack on the airliner.
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, who headed the Navy's investigating
team, said the captain of the Vincennes, Will Rogers III, ordered
the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken belief the airliner was an
Iranian F-14 fighter plane.
</P>
<P>
Carlson, in his article, puts some of the blame on himself.
``I wondered aloud in disbelief, but I did not do the one thing
that might have helped,'' he wrote. ``I did not push for a
reevaluation.
``Had I done so, the information might have come forward quickly
enough to allow me to attempt to dissuade the Vincennes from
shooting.''

BOMB BLOWS UP VAN DRIVEN BY WIFE OF VINCENNES CAPTAIN; SHE ESCAPES 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN DIEGO 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wife of Capt. Will Rogers III, skipper of the San Diego-based Vincennes, 
escaped unharmed Friday morning moments before a pipe bomb exploded under her 
van, igniting a fire that gutted her vehicle at a busy La Jolla intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the 7:40 a.m. explosion, the FBI took control of the investigation, 
suspecting that the bombing might be an act of "domestic terrorism" linked to 
the Vincennes' accidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the 
Persian Gulf last July, killing 290. The Navy and Marine Corps tightened 
security at every military installation in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it raises the question whether there was a terrorist group involved 
in this," said Gary Laturno, an FBI spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
No Motive Yet 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, a federal law enforcement 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, we have no motive; we have no suspect," said Thomas A. 
Hughes, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego. "We do not rule out 
the possibility of retribution against Capt. Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Defense Department official said that there was "no evidence" 
of a terrorist connection Friday, and some law enforcement officials described 
the bombing as "amateurish." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, federal officials acknowledged that the incident followed an FBI 
lookout report issued in San Diego in late December for a Syrian national 
allegedly linked to the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259 
passengers and crew members in Scotland last year. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the FBI document, obtained by The Times, said the Los Angeles FBI 
office had received an anonymous phone call alleging that the Syrian, 
identified as Farwan Abdin, was "involved in or responsible for the Flight 103 
bombing over Scotland." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI added: "Also mentioned were Navy quarters or TV station. No further 
information given." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's assessment at the time was that the call was "shoddy" but that 
efforts should be made to locate Abdin. Officials said Friday that a serious 
investigation of the call was never launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Rogerses were being protected Friday night by the Naval Investigative 
Service and other Navy personnel at an undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not home, and we will not disclose their location," said Chief Craig 
Huebler, a Navy spokesman. "And we won't discuss it beyond that. That gets into 
security, and you can understand the sensitivity to that." 
</P>
<P>
He said that no special security precautions had been undertaken for Rogers, 
crew members and their families after the Vincennes returned to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should the Vincennes crew be treated any different?" he said. "There was 
nothing to indicate a threat to the crew or to their families." 
</P>
<P>
All 360 sailors assigned to the Vincennes were alerted by their commanders 
Friday morning of the bomb in the Rogerses' van and urged to take whatever 
precautions they deemed necessary, Huebler said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and Navy officials said Rogers and his wife telephoned their son, Bill 
Rogers, at an eastern university, where he is a student. They assured him that 
they were safe. 
</P>
<P>
After the bombing Friday, an FBI spokesman said the Rogerses' van was usually 
driven by Sharon Rogers, but two highly placed law enforcement sources told The 
Times that Will Rogers drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident 
about an hour before the blast. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred while the van was in the left-turn lane on Genesee 
Avenue, south of La Jolla Village Drive. A law enforcement official, who asked 
not to be identified, said Sharon Rogers told investigators that she pulled up 
behind three or four cars stopped at a red light at the intersection and then 
suddenly heard two popping sounds. 
</P>
<P>
The official said she believed that her van had been struck in the rear by 
another car, so she got out and walked to the back of the van to look for 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
"And then it all went up," the official said. "That's all there was to it. 
There were holes everywhere, and there was plenty of burn." 
</P>
<P>
The explosion propelled metal fragments through the roof of the white Toyota 
and ignited a fire that destroyed the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
One law enforcement source said several construction workers nearby reported 
that moments after the explosion, a red car quickly made a U-turn over the 
traffic median on Genesee and sped from the scene. No other description of the 
car was available, but witnesses said there were four people in it. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb," he 
said, "or it could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was trying not 
to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers, 50, was on her way to her job as a fourth-grade teacher at La 
Jolla Country Day School when the bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
Other Vehicles Undamaged 
</P>
<P>
Though the van was surrounded on three sides by other vehicles, none of them 
were damaged, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe she got out just as it blew," said Kurt Lent, a laborer who was 
walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers was dazed but walking under her own power, when the laborers 
reached her. They took her to a pickup truck, where she told them that she was 
the van's sole occupant and asked them to call her husband. Will Rogers arrived 
at the scene within a few minutes, and police took the couple to the San Diego 
Police Department's Northern Division headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"She looked like she'd just been rear-ended or something," said Charles Archer, 
one of two masonry workers to reach Rogers first. "She was surprised and 
shocked, but she wasn't burned and she wasn't bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police and FBI agents rushed to the Rogerses' home on Sherlock Court, 
checking two other vehicles and the home with dogs specially trained to sniff 
for explosives. Investigators also used mirrors to look beneath the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30 
a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop. He returned, drank coffee with 
his wife, and then Sharon Rogers, who usually drove the van, left in the 
vehicle, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
When Sharon Rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was 
nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any 
possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the Iranian 
jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the van had been parked in the driveway overnight, 
but that neither the Rogerses nor any neighbors reported prowlers near the 
vehicle. He also said the Rogerses have a family watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
"The dog didn't bark, and the dog barks at everybody," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that her family had received no 
threats since the airplane was downed. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no threats, nothing," he said. "That's what's funny. If you're 
getting telephone calls in the middle of the night and threatening letters and 
graffiti, you would worry. But here there was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, the FBI declined comment on most aspects of the investigation, but 
at a press conference, the FBI's Hughes said, "An explosive device exploded in 
the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
However, two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed 
on the transmission under the van. 
</P>
<P>
"If she didn't get out like that . . . well, she was very, very lucky," one 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs 
apparently came from one or two explosive devices, and that the apparatus was 
connected under the van's transmission. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said 
has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were 
planted on the vehicle or that only a small amount of high-intensity explosives 
were used. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, San Diego Fire Department officials confirmed that the blast was 
caused by a pipe bomb. Archer said he found a flattened, 2-by-3-inch section of 
metal pipe near the curb and turned it over to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes, a guided-missile cruiser based in San Diego, returned from its 
six-month Persian Gulf deployment last October. It remains in port with Rogers 
as its skipper. 
</P>
<P>
As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3, Iran Air 
Flight 655 appeared on the U.S. warship's high-tech radar system. After the 
plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers 
gave the order to fire. 
</P>
<P>
That decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew. But the 
aircraft that Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter was actually an Airbus 
A300. All aboard were killed when the plane was knocked out of the air by a 
Vincennes missile. 
</P>
<P>
After the downing of the plane, Iran said it would seek retribution for the 
deaths of the innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
No Threats 
</P>
<P>
However, Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made 
against Rogers, the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship 
returned to San Diego. The Vincennes and Rogers received some "negative" mail 
last July, shortly after the Iranian plane was shot down, a spokesman said. The 
mail was critical of the Vincennes' handling of the incident but did not 
contain threats, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Vincennes returned to San Diego, Rogers has been overseeing routine 
ship maintenance and training in preparation for its next deployment. The Navy 
does not disclose the dates any of its ships will be deployed, but surface 
ships normally work in 18-month cycles, spending about six months at sea and 
the remainder of the time at or near their home ports. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism experts believe that the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 may have 
been retribution for the Vincennes' shooting down of the Iranian jetliner. But 
no organization that authorities thought capable of the act has claimed 
responsibility for the bombing of the Pan Am aircraft.

ROGERS REASSIGNED TO SHORE DUTY; 
MILITARY HONORS VINCENNES CAPTAIN 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Will C. Rogers III was awarded the Legion of Merit, a top military honor, 
on Saturday as he stepped down from command of the Vincennes. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was given the award for his performance as commanding officer of the 
guided-missile cruiser, which became the focus of international controversy 
last July when it mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf, 
killing all 290 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
He has been reassigned to shore duty at the Point Loma Tactical Development and 
Training Group in what Navy officials describe as a routine transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the deck of the Vincennes, Rogers paid special tribute to his 
wife, Sharon, who narrowly escaped death in March when a suspected terrorist 
bomb destroyed her van as she was driving to her teaching job at an exclusive 
private school in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"She literally rode the fireball out of the vehicle, sprinted to the curb, 
combed the shrapnel from her hair and asked a construction worker to call and 
inform me that she had experienced a minor mechanical difficulty," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived, she was most concerned, as her lesson plans were in flames and 
she was going to be late for school." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, who was seated among 500 spectators on the pier next to the ship, 
drew a standing ovation from the crowd as she accepted a bouquet of red roses 
from the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
She was fired by administrators of the exclusive La Jolla Country Day School, 
who feared that her presence posed a security threat to the children. She has 
since reached a $135,000 financial settlement with the school. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were a number of children from the fourth-grade class Sharon 
Rogers taught at the La Jolla Country Day School. Giggling and smiling, the 
children gathered around her before the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony took place amid unusually tight security Saturday. Only invited 
guests were allowed on the base and all had to pass through two security checks 
and a metal detector. The Rogerses remain under the constant protection of the 
Naval Investigative Service. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Rogers was presented with a letter saying that while on duty in the 
Persian Gulf, his "tactical skills and calm direction enabled his crew to 
successfully engage seven heavily armed high-speed Iranian surface craft" 
attacking the Vincennes in "confined and confused waters. As a result, five 
craft were destroyed and two retreated." 
</P>
<P>
The letter made no mention of the Iranian airliner, which Rogers ordered shot 
down that day in the mistaken belief that it was an Iranian fighter plane. 
Rogers and his crew were cleared of any responsibility for the mistake in a 
Defense Department investigation last year.
