20,000 New Hotel Rooms Planned As Vegas Resort Industry Booms
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 30 years ago, Life magazine
took a look at the burgeoning little desert town of Las Vegas and
wondered if it wasn't overbuilt.
</P>
<P>
The year was 1955 and five new resort hotels had just opened,
prompting the magazine to question where they would get people to
fill them.
``Has Las Vegas pushed its luck too far?'' Life asked.
</P>
<P>
History has proven doubters to be wrong. Las Vegas has grown
from a dusty town of a few resorts into a booming metropolis of
more than 600,000 people, with nearly 60,000 hotel and motel rooms
to accomodate tourists.
</P>
<P>
Now, as Las Vegas undergoes one of the most ambitious of its
periodic building booms, there are few who believe that
overbuilding is a problem. Tourism is growing and the gaming and
resort industries are attempting to capitalize on the trend.
``There is still a tremendous amount of demand out there that
hasn't been satisified,'' said Rossi Ralenkotter, director of
marketing for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.
``We're in a very strong growth pattern and all indications are
that it will continue.''
Nearly 20,000 new hotel rooms either are under construction or
awaiting groundbreaking, as resorts compete to add rooms they hope
will bring in even more tourists and gamblers in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Part of that optimism is based on figures showing hotels
averaged 90.2 percent occupancy during 1987. Such extremely high
rates meant potential guests often were turned away by a lack of
rooms: on weekends, it is nearly impossible to get a room and on
three-day holiday weekends it's even worse.
</P>
<P>
Visitor volume nearly has doubled in the last 12 years, with an
estimated 17 million tourists each expected to spend an average of
2-3 days in Las Vegas during 1988.
</P>
<P>
Gaming revenues kept pace, growing 14 percent in 1987 to a
record $2.74 billion in southern Nevada.
``We're penetrating markets we've never penetrated before,''
said Dave Verbon, publicity director at the Riviera Hotel. ``There
are vast numbers of people out there we never tried to reach before
and now we're going after them and getting them.''
Already boasting the world's two largest resort hotels, Las
Vegas soon will have five hotel-casinos with more than 3,000 rooms
apiece. Two resorts _ the Riviera and the Flamingo Hilton _ are
about to begin work on expansions that will bring them to more than
4,000 rooms apiece.
</P>
<P>
The Riviera opened a new 1,000-room highrise March 1 and plans
to begin construction of a 1,700-room tower in the fall.
``You have to build towers to have a very high volume of
business to drive a large casino with a large number of slot
machines and blackjack tables,'' said Verbon. ``We think there are
enough potential customers to support these huge hotels.''
The centerpiece of the new construction is the Golden Nugget, a
massive resort rising from a desert parcel adjacent to Caesars
Palace. When finished sometime late next year, the $550 million
resort will have 3,200 guest rooms set in a watery tropical setting
that hotel officials claim will be like nothing Las Vegas has ever
seen.
``It's really on a completely different plane in terms of what
we presently have,'' said Nugget President Bobby Baldwin. ``It's
very difficult to compare the new Nugget to anything.''
Baldwin says he has few worries that the Nugget will be able to
fill its rooms with gamblers and tourists. The company's downtown
resort regularly sells out its rooms.
``We're very bullish,'' he said. ``Tour and travel continues to
grow and the individual traveler market continues to expand,
particularly from Southern California. International business has
also expanded in the last few months and we hope to see that
continue.''
The tourism economy has been helped by the growth in three-day
weekends and a national trend toward mini-vacations of 2-3 days.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas has also been very successful in landing conventions,
which attracted 1.6 million people to the city in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Part of the Las Vegas lure also comes from room rates that
average $45 a night, far below the $100 or more charged by
non-gaming hotels in other cities.
``It's the bargain aspect, the ability to have a very enjoyable
convention or vacation visit at far less expense than any other
destination,'' said Ralenkotter.
</P>
<P>
The city's hotels in the past four to five years have begun
exploiting the vast middle-class and tourism markets they once
eschewed in favor of attracting a handful of high-rolling gamblers.
</P>
<P>
The expanded customer base, hotel operators believe, gives them
protection against a recession or sudden rise in fuel prices that
could have a negative impact on tourism levels.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, a national recession combined with high fuel
prices and the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City stopped
the Las Vegas growth rate in its tracks.
``In good times everybody does pretty well and the better
operators do even better,'' said Baldwin. ``In bad times good
operators don't do quite as well but they still do well. The best
operators do great in both times.''

Convention Creates an Odd Couple: Las Vegas, Southern Baptists
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sin City is about to meet its Maker.
</P>
<P>
The first contingents of up to 18,000 Southern Baptists began
arriving this weekend for an ``evangelistic blitz'' in the nation's
gambling capital. They hope to leave behind 12 new churches and tens
of thousands of religious tracts by the end of their annual
convention.
``I embrace the old philosophy, if someone gives you a lemon, you
make lemonade,'' said John B. Wright, a convention organizer.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and
swingers in recent years, is ready for the Southern Baptists.
``We want all the conventions we can get and we don't give a damn
who they are,'' said John Reible, a spokesman for the Las Vegas
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The site represents a marriage of convenience for Southern
Baptists and the city built on the vices they condemn.
</P>
<P>
The 14.8 million-member Southern Baptist Convention has more than
doubled its membership in a quarter century and surpassed the United
Methodist Church as the nation's largest Protestant denomination.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas, a desert town of 5,600 little more than five decades ago,
is growing at the rate of 3,000 people a month and there are now
about 700,000 people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas is one of only 15 U.S. cities that can provide the
hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention,
said Alvin C. Shackleford, a convention spokesman.
``It just seemed sooner or later we would accept the invitation
of the people of Las Vegas to come,'' he said. There are about
22,000 Southern Baptists in 71 churches in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
Six years after the denomination voted to meet in Las Vegas, the
decision still evokes controversy, and many Southern Baptists have
decided to stay home.
</P>
<P>
While conventions in recent years have drawn as many as 45,000
people, estimates for the convention running Tuesday through
Thursday range from 13,000 to 18,000.
</P>
<P>
Reasons include the reluctance of Southern Baptists to expose
their children to the gambling scene, the city's remoteness from the
denomination's strongholds in the Southeast and an apparent lack of
burning issues as the struggle between the denomination's moderates
and conservatives stretches into its 11th year.
</P>
<P>
Southern Baptists leaders say Las Vegas offers an opportunity to
put aside internal battles and emphasize evangelism.
``The choice of Las Vegas was deliberate in that the Southern
Baptist Convention hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in
Las Vegas,'' said Stan Hastey, executive director of the Southern
Baptist Alliance, a moderate group.
</P>
<P>
A series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign
Saturday in which about 2,000 Southern Baptists were expected knock
on doors around Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
To keep the focus on evangelism when the meetings begin,
convention President Jerry Vines said he is seeking postponement of
a controversial proposal by conservatives to create a Religious
Liberty Commission. The commission would lobby Congress on issues
such as organized prayer in public schools and tax credits for
tuition paid to parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
Church leaders said the internal struggle has taken a toll on the
evangelistic efforts of the denomination, where membership has
increased barely more than half a percent in each of the last two
years.
``The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing,'' said
Jay Strack, president of the Conference of Southern Baptist
Evangelists.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the conference plans to lead thousands of Southern
Baptists down the gambling Strip to distribute 10,000 New Testaments
and 20,000 gospel tracts, Strack said.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas officials and some church leaders say the city
variously known over the years as Sin City, Sin City West and Lost
Wages is undeserving of special attention.
``Las Vegas is probably no more notorious in its pagan qualities
than any other city,'' Hastey said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Powers, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority, said life in the residential areas outside the
Strip is little different from anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
In addition to bringing in up to $15 million in revenue, the
Southern Baptist convention should help the city's image, Powers
said.
``I think it's good for the city that a group like this is
meeting here,'' he said.

Appetite for Vegas Real Estate Continues to Grow
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese investors, attracted by bargain
properties and a dramatic increase in tourism here by their
countrymen, have spent or committed $800 million in this
entertainment capital and it's fueling an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
The projects range from four hotel-casinos to a downtown office
building and a massive golf course and resort development.
</P>
<P>
More than 380,000 Japanese tourists are expected to visit Las
Vegas this year, vs. about 300,000 in 1988. That is not lost on some
of Japan's leading economic players.
``More than half the Japanese tourists who come to Los Angeles
will also come to Las Vegas,'' said Yoshi Morichika, who is heading
up a 1,274-acre golf and destination resort community for Japanese
recreation and electronics giant Cosmo World.
</P>
<P>
The project, in nearby Henderson, will include 45 holes of golf,
2,700 condominiums, apartments and luxury homes, a dozen tennis
courts, a tennis stadium and a 700-room hotel.
</P>
<P>
Cosmo World has projects in Japan, Europe, Hawaii, Los Angeles,
San Francisco and Tucson. It added Las Vegas to the list ``because
the land is not expensive, yet, and there is a huge volume of
Japanese tourists here,'' Morichika said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Jane Wilson, who handles international marketing for the Las
Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, says Japanese tourism has
been increasing at about 20 percent a year, and is expected to jump
about 27 percent this year.
``If they come to the West Coast, we're going to get them,'' she
said. ``In their culture, they want to go where a city is known
worldwide, where there are a lot of things to do such as shows,
shopping, sightseeing, et cetera.''
The growing identity of Las Vegas in Japan, bargain real estate
prices, a good economic climate and the attractiveness of the city
are proving a magnet for Japanese investors. The Nevada Development
Authority says Las Vegas is the sixth-fastest growing metropolitan
area in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cosmo World's resort project is expected to cost $200 million by
the time it's completed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Japanese billionaire Masao Nangaku, who bought the Dunes Hotel
and Casino two years ago for $157 million, is planning a 35-story
high-rise office building and 300-room nongaming hotel in downtown
Las Vegas. The cost, when completed in 1991, will be about $120
million.
</P>
<P>
A group of Japanese investors have agreed to help Orlando, Fla.
developer Bob Snow finance a $130 million dining and entertainment
complex known as Winchester Station. Snow is seeking a new site for
the project because some landowners in downtown Las Vegas balked at
selling their property.
</P>
<P>
Japanese businessman Katsuki Manabe, who owns more than 30
arcades in Tokyo, has invested $30 million in the Park Hotel in
downtown Las Vegas and millions more in his Nevada-based Sigma
Games, a gaming equipment maker.
</P>
<P>
Millionaire Ginji Yasuda has invested more than $120 million in
the Aladdin Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The move by the Japanese into the sophisticated gaming industry
has not been smooth.
</P>
<P>
Yasuda, a high-rolling gambler before he bought the Aladdin, has
experienced financial problems at the resort in recent months,
forcing him to dig for sources to pay back taxes and some suppliers.
</P>
<P>
However, one top Nevada gaming source, who asked not to be
identified, said Yasuda's license was up for reconsideration earlier
this year and would not have been continued ``if he had not been
able to meet his gaming obligations.''
The same source said the Japanese had taken over depressed
properties and kept them open ``and any stride forward is a positive
sign.''
The Dunes and Aladdin had been operating under bankruptcy
protection for years before they were purchased by Nangaku and
Yasuda. The Park, the former Holiday Inn downtown, had been closed
for five years before it was refurbished and opened by Manabe.
</P>
<P>
Mike Rumbolz, former Gaming Control Board chairman who now heads
Donald Trump's efforts to enter Nevada gaming, said the Japanese
were hampered because they bought distressed properties that
couldn't make it under American expertise.
</P>
<P>
Sukeaki Izumi, who owns five hotels in Japan and Guam, recently
purchased another closed property, the former Treasury Hotel, which
he has renamed the San Remo. Izumi, who looked at properties in
Hawaii but opted for Las Vegas because of the lower costs, has
committed $30 million for the purchase and renovation of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
Don Woodsmall, who serves with Morichika as project manager of
the Cosmo World project, said Las Vegas was picked by the Japanese
company, in part, ``because the housing market is so strong here.''
Representatives of the company began looking for land in late
1987 and selected a site 10 minutes south of the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Cosmo World project is scheduled to start in the
first quarter of 1990. Several major hotel chains have expressed an
interest in running the resort, Morichika said.
</P>
<P>
Izumi, a millionaire industrialist, became involved in the hotel
business six years ago when he bought a property in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
He switched his focus here, he said, because the city was
smaller, the cost of living was lower, real estate prices were more
attractive, and he liked the way of life.
</P>
<P>
Izumi moved to Las Vegas in December and plans to run the San
Remo personally. The 324-room European-style property is scheduled
to reopen July 1. Izumi has plans for a $30 million 16-story,
340-room tower next year, followed by a second tower and expansion
of the casino.
</P>
<P>
When Nangaku bought the Dunes Hotel two years ago, his attorney
predicted other Japanese businessmen would follow.
</P>
<P>
They did.
``This area is very attractive to the Japanese businessman,''
Izumi said. ``There is no other city like Las Vegas in the world.''

City Can Claim Eight Largest Hotels

Plans announced by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian
to build a 5,000-room resort here would allow Las Vegas to claim
the eight largest hotels in the world by 1992, according to
industry statistics.
</P>
<P>
Of course, Las Vegas' domination of the list dpends on other
cities not building big hotels between now and 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Las Vegas Hilton currently claims the title with 3,174 rooms
but will be surpassed next March when an expansion is completed at
the Flamingo Hilton, giving that Strip resort 3,530 rooms. The
Flamingo will hold the title only a few months, until the Excalibur
opens next summer with 4,032 rooms.
</P>
<P>
Steve Wynn's Mirage Hotel opens next month with 3,054 rooms.
</P>
<P>
Circus Circus, the parent corporation for Excalibur, currently
has 2,800 rooms in Las Vegas, as does Bally's Hotel on the Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Riviera Hotel currently has 2,200 rooms but a planned
expansion will give the resort 3,800 rooms by June of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian built the International Hotel, now the Las Vegas
Hilton, and the MGM Grand, now Bally's. He also owned the Flamingo
at one time.
</P>
<P>
The Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu currently has 2,525
rooms, making it the largest hotel, in number of rooms, outside of
Las Vegas, according to figures in the Hotel and Motel Index. The
number of rooms at the Hawaiian property is not expected to change
in the near future because the hotel recently completed an
expansion, according to Las Vegas Hilton spokesman Bruce Banke.
</P>
<P>
Outside the United States, the New Otani Hotel in Tokyo leads in
number of rooms with 2,056.

<P>
In a state with few people, the city with the
most wins the power game. In Nevada, that makes Las Vegas the
undisputed champ.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas, which welcomes as many as 6,000 new residents a
month, is the reason Nevada is the nation's fastest-growing state.
</P>
<P>
The city's population is expected to reach 1 million by 1995, four
times what it was in 1980.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 800,000 people live there now, out of 1.3 million
in the state as a whole. The three rural counties fighting Clark
County's water plan have a combined population of less than 35,000.
</P>
<P>
That means Clark County controls the Nevada Legislature: 36 of
63 state lawmakers are from the Las Vegas area, and the contingent
is sure to grow with next year's reapportionment. So what Clark
County wants, Clark County has the numbers to get.
``If there's something in state water law we can hang our hat on
to deter this plan, the power is in Las Vegas and Clark County and
they'll just go ahead and change the law,'' said Steve Bradhurst, a
consultant to the rural counties.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas also is the state's financial anchor. Last year, Clark
County casinos accounted for 70 percent of the state's $4.6 billion
in gaming revenues. Clark County needs to keep growing for the
state's economic health, officials say.
``There is one large metropolitan area from which the bulk of
all revenues in this state come, and that's Clark County,'' said
Pat Mulroy, manager of the Las Vegas Valley Water District. ``If .
.. it goes downhill, the whole state goes downhill.''

VEGAS HOTEL CONSTRUCTION IS BOOMING 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LAS VEGAS 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California's favorite gambling town is on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by strong increases in tourism and convention business, Las Vegas hotel 
construction is booming as never before. 
</P>
<P>
Between now and 1992, more than 20,000 hotel rooms will be added to the 61,000 
existing rooms, hotel owners and industry analysts say, and about 7,000 of 
those will be in two hotels. 
</P>
<P>
One is the $630-million Mirage, being built by Golden Nugget Inc., which will 
have 3,100 rooms when it opens Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The other is the $290-million Excalibur, a project of Circus Circus 
Enterprises. It will have 4,032 rooms, the most of any hotel in the country 
when it opens in June. 
</P>
<P>
amp; Horwath, Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mirage and Excalibur will be the first new major projects in the city in 
15 years, and with their unusual features, they will be must-sees." 
</P>
<P>
The president of The Mirage, Bobby Baldwin, said most of his hotel's features 
were "a secret of sorts," but earlier reports indicate that it will have a 
$9-million lagoon, a 49-foot waterfall and a 100-foot-high, sky-lit atrium 
filled with 70-foot-high banyan trees, coconut palms and tropical orchids. 
</P>
<P>
Excalibur will feature a medieval theme, with a moving walkway that will carry 
visitors over a moat and through castle gates to a casino, an amphitheater, 
shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Mirage and Excalibur are being built on "The Strip." But Fletch 
Brunelle, research coordinator for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors 
Authority, said that there are hotel construction projects under way all over 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that about 11,500 hotel rooms are being built, and 38,000 more are 
proposed, some of which will be completed after the 20,000 planned to be 
available by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the new rooms are being added to existing hotels, which are also 
expanding their casinos and convention halls, Leonard added. 
</P>
<P>
The construction boom was created, experts say, by an aggressive marketing 
strategy used in the past few years by the state, the city's Convention 
Authority and the major hotels to capture conventions, trade shows and group 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
Strategy Is Working 
</P>
<P>
The strategy is apparently working. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Vegas is the third largest convention city in the United States and 
probably will be No. 2 within the next two years," Leonard said. (Experts agree 
that New York is No. 1, but they're split, between Chicago and Atlanta as to 
which city is No. 2.) 
</P>
<P>
"Nevada, especially Las Vegas, is already one of the top destinations for group 
tours coming from Asia," said Rich Moreno, state director of tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Since an office to stimulate Japanese travel to Nevada was established in Tokyo 
three years ago, the number of Japanese tourists visiting the state jumped from 
165,000 to 300,000, he added. And he expects the number of all Asian visitors 
to grow after a Taipei office is opened in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Tours from Europe 
</P>
<P>
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority hopes to make the city a top 
destination for tours from Europe as well. "It's in our budget to help fund an 
office in London or Frankfurt," said Frank Sain, the bureau's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau's advertising budget for the next fiscal year is about $10 million, 
and that will be spent on ads in newspapers, magazines, billboards, and TV and 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California is our primary market," Sain said, estimating that 
Californians represent up to 42% of all Las Vegas visitors, which jumped from 
11.7 million to 17.2 million in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the California visitors come from Southern California, said 
Maurice Robinson, a senior manager with KPMG Peat Marwick, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The proximity of Southern California to Las Vegas undoubtedly contributes to 
the fact that the growth in Nevada, in terms of casino revenues and visitors, 
is "overwhelmingly in Clark County," said Andy Grose, executive director of the 
state's Economic Development Commission. "(It) is not a statewide phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin a Boom Town 
</P>
<P>
"If you really want to see a boom town, though, you should go to Laughlin," 
Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin, also in Clark County but a little closer than Las Vegas to Los 
Angeles, had 430 hotel rooms in 1981 but slightly more than 4,000 at the end of 
1988, he noted, and it is expected to have about 13,000 at the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin drew some business from downtown Las Vegas, he said, but owners of the 
downtown Las Vegas hotels and casinos have changed their marketing strategy to 
capture richer customers. 
</P>
<P>
They switched, said Jim Needham of Arthur Young in Seattle, from courting 
"blue-collar workers and moms and pops carrying around milkshake containers of 
nickels to younger people looking for a one-stop place for a show, gambling and 
resort." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking Conventions 
</P>
<P>
Hotel/casino owners throughout Las Vegas responded the same way to business 
setbacks in 1979, when casinos first opened in Atlantic City, N.J., and in the 
early '80s, when there was an economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
They changed their marketing strategy by seeking conventions and those visitors 
who would stay longer than a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Vegas saw what it had to do," said Dave Daley, a partner in the Arthur 
Andersen Real Estate Services Group. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Vegas turned from a weekend regional, getaway place where people would 
drive to go, to a national convention place competitive with such cities as San 
Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles," said Robinson of KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Atlantic City's 30 million annual visitors do not stay overnight, 
observed Sean Hennessey, a vice president of Landauer Associates, New York. 
</P>
<P>
Pull from the Midwest 
</P>
<P>
"And I'd say that Las Vegas still enjoys a tremendous pull from the Midwestern 
states and even from Buffalo and areas approximate to Atlantic City, which is 
still trying to get better airport and convention facilities to emulate Las 
Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
But Las Vegas is still improving its airport and convention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first of a three-phased, $1-billion expansion of McCarran 
International Airport in Las Vegas was completed a few years ago, the second 
phase is under way, and the city has just launched a $35-million expansion of 
its convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Many hotels are also adding convention accommodations, including the Sands, 
where a 1-million-square-foot convention center, touted as "the largest outside 
a facility operated by a community," is expected to be completed in 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
New sites are also coming up for future gaming, convention and hotel 
development. The largest in the city is a 300-acre site owned by the Union 
Pacific Railroad, which is being marketed by Cushman Realty, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of the city's drive to stay on top of the competition, including 
state lotteries, which, gaming experts say, have helped the casinos at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Lotteries have made gaming more acceptable, a mainstream activity," said 
Landauer's Hennessey. 
</P>
<P>
New Experiences Planned 
</P>
<P>
But Las Vegas is banking on more than its current gaming and convention 
capabilities to draw visitors and fill hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
New games and experiences and a proposed train are in the cards. Said John 
O'Reilly, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission: "I think that in the next 
12 to 24 months, there will be some new games with more universal appeal than 
most games of the past." 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas is also betting on what state tourism director Moreno describes as 
"new experiences," like the live dolphins that will perform at the Mirage and 
jousting tournaments that will be held at Excalibur. 
</P>
<P>
"People won't just go to a hotel as a place to stay but as an experience," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas is also betting on a super-speed train, which would make the trip 
from downtown Las Vegas to downtown Los Angeles in an hour - for $65, round 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to happen," said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of 
the 16-member California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Committee. 
"We'll know in a year if it's financially and environmentally possible." 
</P>
<P>
The train would be privately funded at a cost of $3.5 billion, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Race is On 
</P>
<P>
Despite the price, Arnie Adamsen, a Las Vegas city councilman and vice chairman 
of the commission, said, "It could conceivably start construction in 1993 and 
be on line from 1996 to 1998." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the race is on to see which hotel will have the most rooms to 
attract the largest conventions. 
</P>
<P>
For some time, the 3,174-room Las Vegas Hilton has been billed as "the largest 
hotel in the free world." It will be overshadowed by the Flamingo Hilton after 
a 750-room expansion there brings the Flamingo's room count to 3,650 in early 
1990, but Excalibur will be the biggest when it opens in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
A 1,700-room, 42-story tower, which is being called "the tallest in the state," 
is expected to bring the Riviera Hotel's room count to about 4,000 in late 1991 
or 1992. And a 1,500-room tower to be completed in 20 months at the Sands will 
bring that hotel's room total to nearly 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
The number of rooms under construction is a lot in a short period of time, 
experts agree, but most are optimistic that occupancy rates will remain high 
after a slight downturn. A glut of hotel rooms will exist, said Leonard, but 
only temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
Occupancy Rates 85% 
</P>
<P>
Current occupancy rates are in the 85% range in Las Vegas, while occupancies 
range between 65% and 70% for hotels in the rest of the country, according to 
Hennessey. 
</P>
<P>
"What's dropping is motel occupancy," said Sain, of the Convention Authority. 
</P>
<P>
It's still at a respectable 73%, he noted, "but they're not getting the hotel 
overflow. In the eight years I've been here, not that many new motels have been 
built because most convention and trade show people want hotels with all their 
amenities." 
</P>
<P>
In the long-range, predicted Leonard, Las Vegas will continue to grow "because 
there is so much happening there. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you consider that only about 10% of the people in the United States 
have ever been to Las Vegas, you know that the city has a hell of a long way to 
grow." 
</P>

THE MATURE TRAVELER: READERS FIND DISCOUNTS APLENTY IN LAS VEGAS 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's On in Las Vegas is a handy biweekly magazine that lists not only 
entertainment and other attractions around the city, but offers much helpful 
general information, too. 
</P>
<P>
In its regular feature, "What's On for the Young at Heart," it reports that 
seniors get 25% off regular rates at the St. Tropez Hotel, an all-suite, 
non-gaming hotel on Harmon Avenue off the Strip. Since the offer is subject to 
room availability, reservations are suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The Palace Station, also off the Strip on Sahara Avenue near Interstate 15, 
offers seniors a $30 rate Sunday through Thursday. And the Four Queens in 
downtown Las Vegas has a $35 rate during the same time period. 
</P>
<P>
For low-cost senior dining, the magazine suggests, among other places, the 
downtown Gold Strike Inn, which has a $1.99 senior dinner buffet from 3 to 10 
p.m. Tuesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine also tells about the Southern Nevada University of Cosmetology, 
which gives a 20% discount on all services Thursday and Friday to those 60 
years and older. The Academy of Hair Design offers a similar discount on 
Tuesday and Wednesday, but sets the age at 62 and older. 
</P>
<P>
The column also tells of the Las Vegas Transit System's sizable senior offer, 
cited in this column before but worth repeating. All that's necessary is a 
Medicare card to get a 10-ride pass for $4.20. A regular Las Vegas bus ride is 
$1.10. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine also informs readers of discounts on rental cars, motor scooters, 
even wheelchairs for $5 a day. Other senior deals are for bowling, shopping and 
various attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors can pick up a copy at any hotel in Las Vegas or send $2.50 to What's On 
in Las Vegas Magazine, 610 S. Third St., Las Vegas, Nev. 89101. 
</P>
<P>
Also from Las Vegas is a $2 reference guide published by the Las Vegas Advisor. 
It's not specifically for mature travelers, but has good tips for those looking 
for the best deals in meals and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The small-but-handy, single-sheet guide includes other senior-oriented data, 
such as the five casinos in town with penny slots. Other features are the costs 
of all Las Vegas production shows, plus a map and toll-free numbers for all 
casinos and other travel services. Send $2 to Huntington Press, P.O. Box 28042, 
Las Vegas, Nev. 89126 
</P>
<P>
Chandris Fantasy Cruises has announced a series of senior-saver Caribbean 
cruises for travelers 65 years and over next spring and fall. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors who are the second occupant in a cabin with a full-fare passenger get 
50% off the regular cruise price, a savings that could be as high as $848 for a 
one-week cruise. That includes round-trip air fare from Los Angeles to the 
cruise departure point. 
</P>
<P>
Fantasy Cruises include the Amerikanis and the Victoria. For more information, 
contact Chandris Fantasy Cruises at (800) 621-3446 or check with your travel 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers looking for Thanksgiving tours might want to check with 
Trieloff Tours, a longtime senior tour operator with STRAC. 
</P>
<P>
Trieloff will serve its Thanksgiving meals for seniors in Hawaii, Key West, 
Mexico and Australia. The meals will be served during a 10-day tour to Hawaii, 
a 13-day Florida tour, a weeklong Mexico cruise and a 22-day tour of the South 
Pacific. For more details or brochures, call Trieloff at (800) 432-7125. 
</P>
<P>
All nine Sheraton Hotels in Hawaii will repeat the chain's "Gold Guest" program 
from now to Dec. 20, offering a 25% room discount for AARP members and other 
mature travelers age 60 and older. 
</P>
<P>
At check-in, guests also receive a Golden Guest card that allows additional 
discounts at selected Sheraton restaurants and shows, as well as more savings 
from local merchants and services. 
</P>
<P>
The 140 Rodeway Inns have been sold to Quality Inns, bringing the chain's 
number of hotels to more than 1,700. Quality Inns has since changed its name to 
Choice Hotels International. 
</P>
<P>
For now, no changes in senior discounts are planned at any of the hotels, which 
include Quality Inns, Clarion Hotels, Sleep Inns and Rodeway Inns.

WHILE Lou Rawls performs at the Golden Nugget and exotic showgirls romp at the
Stardust, a packed showroom at the Desert Inn Hotel and Casino is anxiously
awaiting the arrival of Mr. Cucumber from Taiwan.;    "Ladies and gentlemen!"
the master of ceremonies shouts in Chinese as the band cranks up. "That
superstar king of Taiwan comedy, Hu Gua!"  
</P>
<P>
The crowd cheers. The tuxedo-clad Chinese performer, whose stage name means
"cucumber" in Chinese, storms onto center stage through a flood of pulsating
lights and billowing stage smoke.;    Hu Gua, the "Johnny Carson of Taiwan,"
launches into a snappy Chinese tune.;    "Oh, he's good," one woman swoons.
</P>
<P>
"He's the king.";    It is a sign of the changing times on the Las Vegas
Strip. Where Liberace, Wayne Newton and Sammy Davis Jr. once ruled, the
marquees now blare with names such as Hu Gua, Ma Shih-li and Yang Lieh.;   
Las Vegas - that paradigm of American excess and decadence - has discovered
Asia.;    Stung by seesawing oil prices, competition from Atlantic City, N.J.,
and a moribund U.S. economy, Las Vegas has turned its attention toward Japan,
Hong Kong, Taiwan and other booming Asian countries in search of gamblers.;   
Instead of Middle Eastern potentates or Texas oil barons, it is the Asian
gambler who has become not only the most sought after high-roller of the '90s,
but also, with the growth of the Asian community on the West Coast, the
low-roller as well.;    "They gamble every day, they wager against each other,
they play hard," said Terry Lanni, president of Caesars World Inc., which owns
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.;    As the world economy shifts toward the Far
East, the ripples are being felt in this opulent outpost in the desert.;   
Casinos are courting the Asian gambler with everything from $6 overnight bus
tours from Los Angeles' Chinatown to all-expense-paid junkets out of
Indonesia, Taiwan and South Korea.;    The largest casinos, such as Caesars
Palace and the Mirage, have opened year-round marketing offices in the Far
East, and most have introduced Asian games into their repertoire, such as pai
gow and sic bo.;    "The business from Asia has just exploded incredibly,"
said Desert Inn President Kevin J. Malley. "They are the No. 1 gamblers in the
world right now.";    Old-timers around Glitter Gulch say the importance of
the Asian gambler to Las Vegas has been mounting for the past two decades.;   
Far Eastern gamblers have enjoyed a longstanding reputation as loyal and
persistent players, which they attribute to the entrepreneurial spirit that
created the Asian economic boom.;    But it was only in the 1980s, as the
Japanese gross national product nearly tripled to $3.1 trillion and the Taiwan
stock market index grew eightfold in four years, that the pursuit of the Far
Eastern gambler reached fever pitch.;    In the last five years, casinos have
begun scurrying to outdo each other with ever more opulent Asian parties,
Asian gaming areas and Asian restaurants.;    Las Vegas also exerts a powerful
allure for Asian visitors from the gray industrial centers of the Far East,
who are fascinated by not only the gambling (illegal in most of Asia) but also
the excessive vision of opulence that pervades the city.;    "Everyone wants
to come to America to become wealthy," said Ling Chuang, a 24-year-old
Alhambra student who was on her first visit to Las Vegas. "This is America. It
is so prosperous, like an illusion.";    The biggest casino market is still
the domestic one, but Asian gamblers exert a power that far exceeds their
numbers.;    Malley estimated that 90 of the casino's top 100 gamblers are
Asians and that about 45 percent of the casino's revenue comes from the
Pacific Rim.;    "It's not just limited to the Desert Inn," Malley said. "The
same is true of Caesars, the Mirage or whatever.";    The increasing flow of
Asian tourists has transformed not just the casinos, but Las Vegas as well.;  
The Asian population in town has increased with the demand for bilingual
casino workers. Sightseeing companies, hotels, restaurants and even escort
services regularly advertise in Asian languages now.;    The renowned Chicken
Ranch brothel near Las Vegas recently had its sex menu printed in Japanese,
leading to such translational challenges as "Fantasy Session" and "Y'all come
back now - y'hear.";    But there have been numerous missteps, as well, as
businesses have leaped into the race to tap into the Pacific Rim.;    The
Mirage had designed a private gambling area with shelves of books along the
walls, only to discover later that the Chinese word for "library" is
pronounced the same as "room of losses." The books were quickly removed.

A volcano will erupt next month on the fabled Strip: a 60-foot mountain spewing smoke and flame every five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The man-made inferno will tower over a man-made lagoon with more than four acres of pools, grottoes and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors, whisked from the Strip on a moving walkway, will glide over a habitat for rare white tigers, which will star in performances by the famed illusionist team of Siegfried 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Roy. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, six dolphins will frolic in a 1.5 million-gallon saltwater aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
At the core of all this stands a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In the lobby behind its nine-story, orchid-strewn atrium, a 20,000-gallon aquarium will come alive with sharks, stingrays, angelfish, puffers and other creatures of the deep. 
</P>
<P>
And oh, yes. 
</P>
<P>
There's a casino, the financial heart of it all. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Mirage, a $630 million island-fantasy hotel-casino now being completed for opening in November by Golden Nugget Inc. 
</P>
<P>
It's the most stunning example of Las Vegas's concerted effort to transform itself into a world-famous vacation resort for families as well as gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas has seen nothing quite like it before. 
</P>
<P>
Not for 15 years has a big new hotel-casino opened here. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Mirage and Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.'s $290 million Excalibur are going up. 
</P>
<P>
The Excalibur, with a castlelike hotel, jousting tournaments and other Arthurian attractions, will be able to handle up to 30,000 visitors a day when it opens in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
If MGM Grand Inc. proceeds with its plan for an amusement park - a $700 million movieland resort with a working studio, casino and 5,000-room hotel that would become Las Vegas's biggest - the investment in the three properties will total some $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
MGM Grand has agreed to buy a 117-acre site for the resort for $93 million in cash plus stock currently valued at nearly $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller projects swell the figure to at least $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Still other projects that have been announced but not yet started could put expenditures above $3 billion over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen A. Wynn, who owns 29.4% of Golden Nugget's shares, says the Mirage and other projects will help Las Vegas attract a whole new generation of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"If you create a wonderment, if you create something so exciting that the public dreams of being part of it, then they'll come," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 75,500. 
</P>
<P>
By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room, Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The county at the end of 1988 had 307,000 jobs, 95,400 of them in the tourist industry. 
</P>
<P>
Projects in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further 48,000 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel-casino operators play down the possibility of a labor shortage. 
</P>
<P>
After all, 40,000 newcomers a year are settling in the Las Vegas Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Nevada state labor economists think a shortage is probable. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody yet seems to have calculated the total number of slot machines, crap tables or roulette wheels Las Vegas will add to the enormous store that Lady Luck already guards here, much less the ultimate impact of the growth on schools and municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44% of Las Vegas tourists who fly here. 
</P>
<P>
This year, by one means of transport or another, more than 18 million people will visit the city. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will set off a marketing war among the big hotel-casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas promises, or threatens, to become a giant carnival, with rooms to be had for $45 a day or less, for visitors uninspired solely by gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a riot of jousting knights, circus clowns, gold-leaf centurions and creatures of the wild, lesser competitors will fall. 
</P>
<P>
Caesars World Inc. plans to defend its august reputation by sinking $190 million into its opulent Caesars Palace, next door to the new Mirage, and adding a $100 million shopping area reminiscent of Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Palace, with its marble fountains and toga parties for high rollers, is already well-known for its Caesarean theme. 
</P>
<P>
The Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace, Frontier and others are pouring millions of dollars into facelifts, new room towers and casino floor space just to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
Where's this huge amount of investment capital coming from? 
</P>
<P>
Golden Nugget, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s first casino client, has borrowed on more than $600 million worth of mortgage notes, mostly sold to private investors by Drexel, to build the Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Other casino owners, Circus Circus among them, are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as First Interstate Bank of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Will the investments pay off? 
</P>
<P>
The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will. 
</P>
<P>
Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the tourists left $3 billion with the area's casinos, nearly 10% more than in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The people with a stake in Nevada's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade. 
</P>
<P>
"If you build a better mousetrap, it will catch more mice," says Fred Benninger, chairman of MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Cokely, a tourist from Alton, Ill., seems inclined to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love it if my daughter had something else to do here," says Ms. Cokely, watching seven-year-old Kristin on the water slide at the Strip's Wet `n' Wild water park. 
</P>
<P>
"Two generations ago, Dad came to Las Vegas by himself for a little diversion," says Van Heffner, executive vice president of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association. 
</P>
<P>
"One generation ago, Mom joined Dad. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the `90s, we're headed toward a total resort environment." 
Only a decade or so ago, casino managers balked at in-room TV sets and other fripperies that distracted from gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Casinos today offer bowling alleys, water parks, golf courses, tennis courts, lush swimming pools and other diversions, and more such facilities are being designed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new emphasis on the family trade, however, tourists in search of naughtier fun than gambling seem certain to find it, with Las Vegas call girls remaining on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
A serious economic downturn, pessimists observe, could hurt the expansionists. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, the naysayers' voices are drowned by the roar of cement mixers and the clanging of construction cranes along the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
This is no place for pedestrians, but at 7:30 on a recent morning, when construction choked traffic at the famous Four Corners intersection to one lane, a taxi passenger found it faster to abandon the cab and walk to her destination. 
</P>
<P>
The ferocious competition probably will drive some poorly managed properties into bankruptcy or new ownership. 
</P>
<P>
It has happened before. 
</P>
<P>
The Dunes, the Aladdin and the Riviera were all acquired by the present owners from bankruptcy proceedings spawned by the last recession, in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that hasn't discouraged investors. 
</P>
<P>
Some have bought big chunks of Strip property for what may turn into another wave of building. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City casino owner Donald Trump is scouting the Las Vegas market with an eye toward building an appropriately spectacular place. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the huge new projects began, the Strip's recent expansion squeezed smaller competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Many blue-collar customers of downtown's no-frills gambling spots have been lured to the Strip or to Laughlin, Nev., a Colorado River town catering to snowbirds and the recreational-vehicle crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel expansion and an influx of more-discriminating tourists have hurt motels. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, the number of motel rooms has fallen by 17,000. 
</P>
<P>
Many people here expect a room-rate war as the new projects open. 
</P>
<P>
"There's probably going to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over the next year, but after that you should see the market return to 80%-plus occupancy and regular rates," says Paul Rubeli, casino executive at Ramada Inc., which runs the Tropicana. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics wonder whether mega-resorts such as the Mirage will be able to squeeze a profit from their cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
The Mirage will cost at least $1 million a day to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Wynn seems confident that it will produce a healthy profit, but some securities analysts doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors and analysts say that among large existing properties Bally Manufacturing Corp.'s Bally Grand hotel-casino probably will be hardest hit among major properties. 
</P>
<P>
Bally officials decline to discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Bally bought the former MGM Grand hotel-casino from Kirk Kerkorian four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Only now is it undergoing a badly needed facelift. 
</P>
<P>
Its parking lot is inconvenient, the MGM lion's-head logo still appears in places, and customers still call it the Grand, rather than the Bally Grand. 
</P>
<P>
It has a "great location, but they're going to have some real problems when everyone around them opens," says Daniel Lee, a Drexel analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Older properties that still have a 1950s image are also vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Any hotel-casino without a strong identity will get whacked by the new competition, says Glenn Schaeffer, senior vice president of Circus Circus. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't know what you are, bigger won't make you better," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"But it'll sure make you poorer." 
Circus Circus's flagship casino has become the envy of competitors for its ability to vacuum cash from the pockets of vacationing families.

The Circus Circus lures them with low room rates, inexpensive buffets and entertainment for children at no extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Excalibur will also appeal to families, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Its castle, Mr. Schaeffer says, will be "the most compelling piece of folk architecture ever built." 
Some casino owners have resisted the temptation to add rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they are spending to reinforce the identity that they believe attracts their customers. 
</P>
<P>
"More rooms aren't the answer for us," says Caesars World chairman Henry Gluck. 
</P>
<P>
While his company's hotel is building a retail complex in Beverly Hills style and redoing existing rooms, it has decreased the number of its rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Some have been combined into suites for the high rollers. 
</P>
<P>
Caesars has made a specialty of catering to high rollers from abroad, who are also being aggressively courted by the Mirage, the Las Vegas Hilton and others. 
</P>
<P>
Other, smaller concerns are also pursuing market niches - Hawaiian tourists, for example, or the local trade. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still room for boutique properties," says James Barrett, president of MarCor Resorts Inc. Off the Strip, MarCor is building the Rio, a hotel-casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms - all of them suites. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the proliferation of tourist distractions, Las Vegans haven't forgot that gambling is still what the town is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"The days when when the thrust of casinos was all high rollers, with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor, are gone," Mr. Sain of the visitors' bureau says. 
</P>
<P>
"But 93% of tourists still come for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
We can't lose sight of that."

Las Vegas, Nev., the fastest growing city in the nation,
faces an economic squeeze.
</P>
<P>
The city's ambitious development plans are coming to
fruition just as the regional economy is beginning to slow.
</P>
<P>
Even as the city's gambling industry is adding thousands of
new hotel rooms, many casinos have been laying off workers.
</P>
<P>
And just as thousands of new homes are ready to go on the
market, housing sales are falling.
"Las Vegas is an accident waiting to happen," says David
Shulman, a Salomon Brothers economist who tracks real estate
markets. "The only reason Las Vegas has been booming is
because it was on the periphery of Southern California. Now,
that's stopped and things are bound to change."
Exciting new projects and aggressive marketing could help
the casinos goose their gambling numbers for a while -
barring a shooting war in the Mideast that plays havoc with
fuel supplies. But the same can't be said in the housing
industry, where out-of-state wealth has fueled growth over
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
As a city that thrived on the free-spending ways of
others, Las Vegas was made for the 1980s. It grew up during
those years from a purely gambling town to a destination
resort attracting families and conventioneers. While gamblers
spent money wildly, builders transformed the Las Vegas
valley's dirt roads, rock and sand into a carpet of housing
developments, man-made ponds and golf courses. Jobs, crisp
desert air and the cheap cost of living lured immigrants from
around the country, and the population nearly doubled, to
780,000 residents from fewer than 450,000.
</P>
<P>
"We are now a mature and diverse community that just
doesn't have the same reliance on casino gaming as it once
did," boasts Don Haze, a commercial real estate broker who
opened a Coldwell Banker commercial leasing office in 1981.
</P>
<P>
But a lengthy downturn could undo some of the
image-building that Las Vegas underwent in the 1980s. "You
must remember that the people who have been successful in
this town have always had their feet on the gas pedal," says
R. Keith Schwer, of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's
Center for Business and Economic Research. When the city was
hit by the recession of 1981, tourism spending grew a little
less than 1%, though visitor volume posted a slight decline.
</P>
<P>
"The movers and shakers have not been conditioned to deal
with great economic downturns," Mr. Schwer says.
</P>
<P>
The recession in the early '80s spurred city leaders to
mount a campaign to help Las Vegas break out of its
dependency on the casino industry. In 1983, the Nevada state
Legislature passed a law permitting interstate banking that
led Citibank to move its credit card distribution center to
Las Vegas. Today, 2,000 people work there. By contrast, the
city's huge new Mirage casino employs about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
But almost no major companies have followed Citibank's
lead. The Nevada Development Authority estimates that in the
past two years only 3,103 new jobs were created by private
sector firms either expanding or moving into Nevada. As a
result, experts say, the economy still lacks the diversity
that would help it weather another prolonged downturn.
</P>
<P>
Still, Las Vegas isn't Phoenix, and there haven't been any
billion-dollar thrift seizures or distressed land sales yet.
</P>
<P>
Even the most pessimistic economists expect Nevada's
population growth to remain healthy. What's more, the
national credit crunch has saved developers from building
projects with no prospect of success.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do now is take a few deep breaths," says
Donald Snyder, chairman and chief executive of First
Interstate Bank of Nevada, a unit of First Interstate Bancorp
and Nevada's biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas does have excesses that are uniquely its own.
</P>
<P>
Huge new Disney-like facilities such as the 3,000-room Mirage
and the 4,000-room Excalibur have forced the industry into a
Darwinian struggle in which older, undercapitalized
facilities are falling behind more modern competitors.
</P>
<P>
"The strong will survive," says Golden Nugget's chairman,
Stephen Wynn, whose $710 million Mirage continues to lure
crowds from neighboring casinos. "But I am worried about some
of our competitors. You can't just build boxes, rent out the
rooms and get by anymore."
Size is no indicator of success, either.
</P>
<P>
Bally Manufacturing Corp., one of the nation's biggest
gambling companies, has defaulted on its casino debt, and it
has trimmed its staff by 600 workers. Other big names have
also hit cold streaks. At Hilton Hotels Corp., high-roller
competition from the Mirage and Caesars Palace has cut into
operating profit, which fell 50% in the third quarter. Now
Hilton, Nevada's biggest employer, plans to trim operating
costs - and staff - in Las Vegas by about 8%. Altogether,
that means layoffs of more than 500.
</P>
<P>
Other once-proud Las Vegas names have been tarnished by
closings and bankruptcy filings. The Landmark hotel and
casino shut its doors earlier this year; the Aladdin has
filed for bankruptcy protection and is slated for auction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, aging casinos like the Dunes and the Stardust have
struggled to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
And even before the town has recovered from the one-two
punch of the Excalibur and Mirage, the industry faces another
challenge from MGM Grand Inc.'s Kirk Kerkorian, who has vowed
to forge ahead with plans for a 5,000-room megafacility. Add
to that the Riviera's 1,600-room new wing, the Stardust's
additional 1,200 rooms and dozens of other projects on the
boards, and further fallout appears certain.
</P>
<P>
"It's what I call the rule of 500," says Alan Pomerantz, a
real estate attorney with Weil, Gotshal 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Manges in New York
City. "If a city projects a need for 500 hotel rooms, then
500 developers will build 500 hotels each with 500 rooms."
The rule of 500 appears to apply to residential
developers, as well. While the twin engines of Las Vegas's
housing growth - the casino industry and the spillover from
the California market - are beginning to sputter, housing
starts continue to climb. Over the next year, builders have
applied for permits to put up more than 49,000 housing units
in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Tight credit could keep as many as 30% from being built,
says Glen Barton of the Meyers Group, a market research
company based in Los Angeles. But that would still leave
34,000 new homes and apartments to absorb.
</P>
<P>
Economists cite another disturbing trend in Las Vegas's
growth pattern: A full 8.1% of all payroll workers are in the
construction sector, suggesting that there aren't enough
indigenous industries to pick up the slack once things quiet
down.
</P>
<P>
And home buying has begun to taper off. According to the
Meyers Group, the number of home sales in the third quarter
dropped 27.3% from a year earlier, while the inventory of
unsold homes was up 15.4%.
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Leon Cohen, a 75-year-old former real
estate broker from Encino, Calif. He cashed in on the
California real estate boom last year and moved to the
serenity of the Nevada desert, where he lives in Del Webb
Corp.'s Sun City, a planned community. As a retiree and
former Californian, Mr. Cohen is the type of resident Las
Vegas planners dreamed of when they imagined an economy freed
from the cyclical whims of the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
But there may not be many Leon Cohens left. "With the
California real estate market going down, I'm sure I couldn't
have made my deal today," he says. "I was lucky things went
so well in California when they did."
Some development companies are betting that any slowdown
will be brief and are plunging ahead with ambitious projects.
</P>
<P>
One is a 25-village city-within-a-city called Summerlin,
developed by Howard Hughes Properties. Designed on 39 square
miles of property, the project won't be completed until early
next century. Construction has already begun on Lake Las
Vegas, a $3.5 billion project bankrolled by the Bass brothers
on 2,200 desert acres.
</P>
<P>
"We all know there'll be a slowdown here, just like
there's going to be one everywhere," says Coldwell Banker's
Mr. Haze. "But they used to say that when California got a
cold, Las Vegas got pneumonia. Now I think when California
gets its cold, we just might only get a case of sniffles."
