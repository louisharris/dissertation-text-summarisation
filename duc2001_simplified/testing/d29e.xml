  U.S. AIR BASE CLEARING OUT AS VOLCANO ERUPTS
IN PHILIPPINES  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 15,000 U.S. service members, dependents and civilians were ordered early
today to evacuate Clark Air Base, one of the largest U.S. bases overseas,
after a Philippine volcano dormant for six centuries began exploding with
searing gases, thick ash and deadly debris.;    Lt. Col. Ron Rand, a spokesman
at Clark, announced at 5 a.m. that all non-essential personnel should begin
evacuating the sprawling base as dawn skies over central Luzon were filled
with gray ash and steam from eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, about 10 miles away
in central Luzon.  
</P>
<P>
Rand said that Americans who live on or near the base would drive or be
bused to the U.S-operated Subic Bay Naval Base, about an hour's drive to the
southwest. The evacuation was to take four hours, he said.;    There was no
indication how long the Americans would stay, but they were ordered to take
along important papers and three days worth of food, water and clothing.;   
Philippines officials earlier had ordered the evacuation of more than 11,000
people from about 20 villages near the volcano, about 60 miles northwest of
Manila, after a series of small eruptions began Friday. No injuries were
reported over the weekend.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said, however, that two
moderate eruptions shortly before 3 p.m. Sunday appeared to signal a larger
explosion.;    "We're expecting a major eruption," he said in a telephone
interview early today. "We're just at the beginning stage of eruptions. We're
expecting many, many more.";    Punongbayan said that the 4,795-foot-high
volcano was spewing gases up to 1,800 degrees, thick black ash, boulders and
rock fragments in two fast-moving streams from two vents on the western side
of the lower summit.;    "It's very dangerous," he said. "Anything along its
path will be destroyed.";    Clouds and ashes;  Sunday's eruptions sent a
dense cloud of steam and ash billowing thousands of feet above rice paddies
that are lush green from an impending harvest. Heavy black clouds shrouded the
mountain, and a blanket of gray ash covered nearby fields. Debris reportedly
was sprayed as far as the South China Sea, 20 miles to the west.;    Villagers
from a 12-mile radius of the mountain fled the area on foot and water buffalo,
and aboard crowded trucks and jitneys. The Philippines Red Cross said 11,024
people, including local Aeta aborigines, were evacuated to 18 disaster relief
centers set up at area schools, but officials said that many villagers stayed
behind to protect their animals and farms from looters.;    Rand said the
evacuation of Clark was ordered "due to a slight increase of volcanic
activity" overnight. All U.S. Air Force planes had moved from the base to Cubi
Point Naval Air Station near Subic on Sunday, and infants in the base's
neo-natal hospital and other patients had been flown out.;    Evacuation
rehearsal;  All military personnel at Clark, home of the 13th Air Force, were
recalled to the base Sunday afternoon, and U.S. officials ordered local
Americans to pack bags and rehearse evacuation procedures.;    "People are
pretty calm," said one American woman who lives on the base. "People are
prepared.";    Rand said that a minimal number of troops would remain at Clark
to guard the facility and maintain essential services. Marines from Subic as
well as Philippines and U.S. military police were deployed along the road to
provide security.;    The volcano began showing signs of activity in April for
the first time in 600 years, and last week it began belching small amounts of
steam and smoke. Seismologists reported a marked increase in volcanic tremors
last week, with intense seismic quakes on the mountain Friday.;     Last
eruption;  Mount Pinatubo last erupted in 1380, 141 years before Ferdinand
Magellan, a Portuguese explorer flying the flag of Spain, first reached the
islands in search of spices.;    There are about 21 active and 200 dormant
volcanoes in the Philippines, which sits on the "Ring of Fire" that circles
the Pacific Ocean. Scientists said there was no connection, however, to the
eruption last Monday of Japan's Mount Unzen, which killed at least 37 people
on Kyushu Island. A fresh flow of lava, gas and debris erupted there Saturday,
setting 73 homes on fire.;    Nearly 10,000 people have left their homes at
the foot of Mount Unzen, and two naval ships stood by to take residents
farther away in case a new eruption sent lava, hot rocks and ash over a yet
wider area.

  PHILIPPINE VOLCANO SET TO BLOW
EXPERT PREDICTS BLAST TO MATCH MOUNT ST. HELENS

<P>
Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six
centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with
force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government
scientist said Monday.;    "I think we could see a major explosive eruption
anytime," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey
office in Menlo Park. Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in
the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April, when it first
stirred.  
</P>
<P>
If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep
across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said. Also in peril are the 350,000
residents of Angeles City, where the air base is located, about 50 miles north
of Manila.;    Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is
likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said.;    Scientists
doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same
time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he said.;    The five USGS
scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base, which was
evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.;    The
researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their equipment, today 
moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano,
where they should be safe from ash avalanches.;    Mount Pinatubo is typical
of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire" on the Pacific coasts
of Asia and the Americas. (These volcanoes - including Mount Lassen in the
Sierra Nevada, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in the Cascade Range -
arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath
another.);    Pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have
yielded at least as much molten rock - half a cubic kilometer - as Mount St.
</P>
<P>
Helens did when it erupted in 1980. Until volcanologists' attention was drawn
to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not
been studied well.;    Waves of hot ash;  Other recent volcanoes that erupted
on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in
Colombia in 1985.;    If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubo's primary
means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash
- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing
and searing all in their path.;    "In the worst case, a really big eruption,
all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with glowing ash, Lipman said.; 
Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal. That
is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.;    Risk to planes;  Such ash
also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base, Lipman
said.;    Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash - indistinguishable on
radar from rain clouds - run the risk of having their engines stalled by the
grit.;    So far, the winds have blown ash away from the base. But winds of
the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash
directly toward the base.;    The volcano's activity - measured by
seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system
- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, Lipman
said.;    The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's
slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. On clear days they fly above
the crater to measure sulfur emissions.;    No link to Japan;  Their
predictions might be a false alarm - the volcano may have done its worst
already. But it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur
emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military
could return to the base.;    Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's
activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable
size.;    "No reputable scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between
the two, Lipman said.;    More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical
time, he noted. "Two out of 500 is no big deal."

  THOUSANDS FLEE ERUPTING VOLCANO
ASH BLACKENS PHILIPPINE SKY AFTER EXPLOSIONS  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mount Pinatubo violently erupted today, spewing gray plumes of steam and ash
10 miles into the sky and sending a deadly mix of searing gas and molten rocks
down the volcano's slopes.;    Sirens sounded within minutes at Clark Air
Base, and 600 U.S. Air Force personnel who remained after an evacuation Monday
fled the base. About 900 others took shelter in a special command center but
remained to guard the facility.  
</P>
<P>
Roads nearby were clogged with cars, jeeps and buses as thousands of
terrified residents fled. Church bells pealed in the city of Angeles, adjacent
to the air base, warning the more than 300,000 residents to seek shelter.;   
Reporters at the scene said the blast created a greenish-gray mushroom cloud
"like an atomic bomb." They said they heard three blasts, and then a huge
gray-greenish cloud burst from the crater, blocking out the sun.;    There
were no immediate reports of injuries. Philippine officials had evacuated
about 19,000 villagers in recent days, but others stayed in scattered hamlets
to tend to their animals and farms.;    All telephone lines to Clark were
down, and Armed Forces Television was unable to broadcast after at least three
eruptions began at 8:51 a.m. (5:51 p.m. PDT), following two smaller emissions
before dawn. Another eruption occured shortly before noon.;    Scientists said
the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could
come later.;    "Most probably there will be more eruptions," said
seismologist Julio Sabit.;    Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine
Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, said everyone within a 12-mile radius
should evacuate, or even within 18 miles, "to be safe.";    'Dark mushroom'; 
"The smoke is very thick, like a dark mushroom in the sky," Gus Abelgas, a
reporter for ABS-CBN television, said in a broadcast from Botolan, near the
volcano's western slopes. "It's just like what we saw in Hiroshima.";    Other
reporters described panic as people scampered for safety with their belongings
and livestock.;    Most of the Americans stationed at Clark were transferred
to the Subic Bay Naval Base and were expected to remain there until the danger
from the volcano was past.;    In volcano's path;    Punongbayan said the site
where Clark is located was in the path of the volcanic flow from Mount
Pinatubo during its last major eruption, in the 14th century.;    Rollie
Rimando, another volcanologist, said a major eruption could hurl debris and
poisonous gases in a 12-mile radius, affecting both the base and parts of
Angeles.;    On Tuesday, a cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet
above the volcano but suddenly dissipated in the afternoon, only to revive
again 20 minutes later. The area on the western slope of the mountain was
covered in a thin layer of ash.;    Ash began falling Monday on villages west
of Angeles near the slopes of Mount Pinatubo, prompting authorities to close
roads there. But Angeles police said Tuesday that no one was evacuating the
area.;    Some refused to go;    A Philippine police major identified only as
Major Reyes said he visited a remote settlement near the volcano after the
blast and tried to talk a handful of residents into leaving. But they refused
to abandon their livestock and water buffaloes, known as carabaos.;    "If our
carabaos die, we'll die with them," the officer quoted them as saying.;   
Col. Jose Balajadia, chief of the Philippine military's Clark Air Base
Command, said Tuesday that troops remaining at the base had been issued gas
masks in case ash falls over the installation.;    At the Subic station,
newcomers from Clark tried to sort out their finances, adjust to cramped
living and otherwise cope with dislocation. Finance officers issued partial
pay to personnel who had to leave before having a chance to go to the bank.;  
Smaller than anticipated;  The eruption appeared to be smaller than that
anticipated by Peter Lipman, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist in Menlo Park,
who on Monday had said an eruption as massive as that of Mount St. Helens
could occur any day.;    After the eruption, Lipman tried unsuccessfully to
telephone five USGS researchers monitoring the volcano from Clark Air Base.;  
In a conversation with Lipman half an hour before the eruption, the
researchers said the volcano had had small eruptions earlier in the day. At
the time of the phone call, they were planning a helicopter ride above the
volcano to survey the size of the lava dome inside its crater.;    There are
about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major
eruption was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That
explosion killed about 200 people.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Filipino American
Chamber of Commerce of Santa Clara County is raising funds for evacuating
residents who live near the erupting volcano. Donations of any kind may be
sent to the Filipino American Chamber of Commerce, Santa Clara County, 72 N.

Mount Pinatubo erupted with three thundering explosions today, shooting a
giant plume of ash more than 12 miles high and chasing nearby residents away
with an outpouring of molten rock and hot gas.;    A Filipino serving with the
U.S. Navy became the first reported fatality related to the eruption when his
car collided with a bus on an ash-slicked road north of the Subic Bay naval
base.  
</P>
<P>
Residents of nearby Angeles panicked at the roar of the initial blast, and
thousands of people packed roads after a huge gray-greenish mushroom cloud
burst from the volcano and turned day to night.;    At a refugee center in
Olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors told of the sky growing
dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed by a rain of ash.;   
"Stones as big as my head were falling down from the mountains," said Rolly
Soria, 18.;    "There was panic everywhere," said Manuel Romualdo, who fled
with his wife, five children, a cat and a dog. "Children were crying. We had
to grab whatever we could.";    Scientists warned of more, possibly larger
eruptions from the 4,795-foot volcano, which was dormant for six centuries
until it began spewing steam in April.;    "This could only be the beginning,"
said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology
and Seismology.;    Tens miles to the east, hundreds of Americans fled Clark
Air Base, home to 15,000 American military personnel and their families. Most
of the base's residents had been evacuated Monday.;    Clark did not appear
threatened by volcanic flow, and there were no immediate reports of
casualties.;    Seismologists said searing gas, ash and molten rock raced at
great speed down the mountain's western and northern slopes and into the
Marella, Maraunot and O'Donnell rivers.;    About 3,000 Aeta tribesman,
descendants of the original inhabitants of the Philippines, fled the slopes of
Mount Pinatubo.;    People scampered for safety with their belongings and
livestock over roads slippery with ash fall. Refugees wore cardboard boxes to
protect themselves from the ash.;    "They were stunned by the eruption,"
reporter Bert Basa said by telephone from Angeles. "Their faces turned ashen,
and it looked like their hair was standing on end.";    Ash was so thick in
the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights on and
wipers operating to clear the windshields of volcanic debris. Bits of ash
wafted across the roads as if along a windy beach.;    A photographer who
circled the volcano in an airplane said an aerial gunnery range at Clark was
covered with ash, as were mountains in the Zambales range, normally lush,
green tropical peaks that now looked like the Alps in winter.;    Today's
eruptions began at 8:40 a.m. with a tremendous blast that sent forth a
mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes later and
a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.;    The huge plume 12 1/2 miles high
could be seen in Manila, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene
said it blocked out the sun. The cloud drifted westward into the South China
Sea.;    Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even
more severe eruptions could come later.;    "The crisis has not ended," said
Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology. "We
have signs that the volcano is preparing for another one.";    Punongbayan
warned people within a 12-mile radius of Pinatubo to flee.;    "The smoke is
very thick like a dark mushroom in the sky," television reporter Gus Abelgas
said in a broadcast from Botolan, near the volcano's western slopes. "It's
just like what we saw in Hiroshima.";    President Corazon Aquino visited
refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for
independence day celebrations.;    Moments after the first explosion, sirens
wailed at Clark Air Base, and 600 of the 1,500 Americans remaining there fled
eastward to safety. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand said 900 Americans,
mostly security personnel, remained at the 130,000-acre base.;    Clark is one
of the biggest U.S. bases overseas. Punongbayan said Tuesday that the site was
in the path of the volcanic flow from Mount Pinatubo during its last major
eruption, in 1380.;    The Pentagon, which is trying to negotiate a new
contract with Manila for the base, said it can work around the temporary loss
of Clark.;    The Americans who fled Clark with a few belongings on Monday
moved in with sailors and their families at Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles to
the southwest.;    Although the Air Force left Clark, Philippine authorities
have not ordered a general evacuation of Angeles, a city of more than 300,000
people adjacent to the base.;    When Mount Pinatubo erupted today, church
bells pealed to sound the alarm and many people froze in their tracks with
fear. Many scampered for safety indoors.;    About 19,000 Filipinos had
earlier been evacuated from three provinces near the volcano's slopes and were
housed in about 25 makeshift evacuation centers outside the projected danger
zone.;    Officials said more were evacuated after today's eruption but they
could provide no new figures.;    In the Sapang Bato area of Angeles, the city
district nearest the volcano, just 2,000 of 13,000 residents had been
evacuated as of Monday, officials said.;    Reporters visiting the village
today found it abandoned except for a few chickens and cattle. Houses were
padlocked, but the explosion had shattered some windows.;    Private jeep and
bus companies were ordered to the area today to pick up stragglers. About 10
people in Moraza, a village on the western slope, were refusing to leave,
relief officials said. They told rescuers that they would not leave their
livestock and if the animals die, "we will die with them.";    On April 2,
Pinatubo produced a small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water
meeting hot rocks deep inside.;    On June 3, the volcano spewed ash in a mild
eruption. That same day, 4,452-foot Mount Unzen in Japan erupted with an
explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.;    A
larger flow days later razed dozens of houses.;    Experts say there is
apparently no connection between Unzen and Pinatubo.;    There are about 21
active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major eruption
was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That explosion
killed about 200 people.

April.;    "This could be only the beginning," said Raymundo Punongbayan,
director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.;   
Angeles, a city of 300,000, is adjacent to Clark Air Base, but authorities had
not ordered a general evacuation there.;    Hundreds of Americans fled Clark,
home to 15,000 American military personnel and their families. Most of the
base's residents had been evacuated Monday. The base did not appear
immediately threatened by volcanic flow.;    Seismologists said searing gas,
ash and molten rock raced at great speed down the mountain's western and
northern slopes. They said most of the debris flowed into the Marella,
Maraunot and O'Donnell rivers and that there had been no reports that property
or homes had been damaged.;    About 3,000 Aeta tribesman, descendants of the
original inhabitants of the Philippines, fled the slopes of Mount Pinatubo.;  
At a refugee center in Olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors
told of the sky growing dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed
by a rain of ash.;    They said they scampered for safety with their
belongings and livestock over roads slippery with ashfall, many wearing
cardboard boxes to protect themselves from the ash.;    "They were stunned by
the eruption," television reporter Bert Basa said. "Their faces turned ashen,
and it looked like their hair was standing on end.";    Ash was so thick in
the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights and
windshield wipers on.;    A photographer who circled the volcano in an
airplane said an aerial gunnery range at Clark was covered with ash, as were
mountains in the Zambales range, normally lush, green tropical peaks.;   
Today's first eruption began at 8:40 a.m. with a tremendous blast that sent
forth a mushroom cloud. It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes
later and a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.;    The huge plume could be
seen in Manila, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene said it
blocked out the sun. The cloud drifted westward into the South China Sea.;   
Two more thundering explosions rocked Mount Pinatubo late today.;    The
Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said the explosions
occurred at 10:52 p.m. and 11:05 p.m. The second explosion sent a plume of ash
and steam 80,000 feet into the sky.;    Shortly after midnight, a sixth
explosion was reported.;    Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of
built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could come later.;    "The
crisis has not ended yet," said Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of
Vulcanology and Seismology. "We have signs that the volcano is preparing for
another one.";    Punongbayan warned people within a 15-mile radius of
Pinatubo to flee.;    "The smoke is very thick like a dark mushroom in the
sky," television reporter Gus Abelgas said in a broadcast from Botolan, near
the volcano's western slopes. He said strong tremors preceded the nighttime
eruptions and continued afterward.;    President Corazon Aquino visited
refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for
independence day celebrations.;    The Americans who fled Clark with a few
belongings Monday moved in with sailors and their families at Subic Bay naval
base, 50 miles to the southwest.;    Clark is one of the biggest U.S. bases
overseas. Punongbayan said Tuesday that the site was in the path of the
volcanic flow from Mount Pinatubo during its last major eruption, in 1380.;   
About 19,000 Filipinos earlier had been evacuated from three provinces near
the volcano's slopes and were housed in 25 makeshift evacuation centers
outside the projected danger zone.;    Officials said more were evacuated
after today's eruption.;    About 10 people in Moraza, a village on the
western slope of the mountain, were refusing to leave, relief officials said.
</P>
<P>
They told rescuers that they would not leave their livestock and if the
animals die, "we will die with them.";    On April 2, Pinatubo produced a
small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water meeting hot rocks
deep inside. On June 3, the volcano spewed ash in a mild eruption.;    That
same day, 4,452-foot Mount Unzen in Japan erupted with an explosion of
superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.;    Experts say there
is apparently no connection between Unzen and Pinatubo.;    There are about 21
active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines. The last major eruption
was the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, in 1965. That explosion
killed about 200 people.

  EXPERT AN INDIANA JONES OF VOLCANOES
MENLO PARK MAN THRIVES ON PRESSURE  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cool-headed "guerrilla seismologist" from Menlo Park whose accurate
predictions of the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo helped save thousands of lives
in the Philippines is right where he wants to be - a cramped bunker a dozen
miles from the exploding volcano.;    One of only a handful of volcano
seismologists in the world, David Harlow, 47, is known as an Indiana Jones of
volcanoes, jumping at the chance to get close enough to pick up the bumps and
tremors that signal an impending eruption and thriving on the high-pressure
decision-making that goes with making predictions.  
</P>
<P>
"He's someone who eats it up," said Randy White, Harlow's friend and
colleague at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. "He's able to totally
concentrate in those sorts of situations.";    The eruptions at Mount Pinatubo
finally gave Harlow the chance to put his skills and experience to work saving
lives. When Harlow went to Mount St. Helens in Washington state in 1980,
geologists were still learning how to read the telltale earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Bureaucratic delays kept Harlow from arriving at Nevado de Ruiz in Colombia
until a day after its 1985 eruption. Harlow and his team predicted the 1989
eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, but few lives were threatened in the
remote area.;    Three weeks ago, Harlow joined a team of five U.S. Geological
Survey scientists who worked with 10 Filipino scientists to try to forecast
the eruption of the volcano, which had been dormant for about 600 years. One
crew gathered evidence of Pinatubo's earlier eruptions as clues to its
potential power.;    Harlow's team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs
around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly
pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption
is imminent.;    Pinatubo followed an almost textbook pattern over the past
six weeks. Gradually building earthquakes were followed by the release of gas,
the buildup of magma and finally the huge explosions that sent ash clouds more
than 75,000 feet into the sky and sent avalanches of hot ash pouring down the
narrow valleys west of the volcano.;    Philippine and U.S. Air Force
officials ordered evacuations Monday.;    Since late Tuesday, Harlow's
colleagues have not been able to get through on the single phone line into the
bunker at Clark Air Base, but do not believe the team is in danger. The
eruption is on the west side of the mountain, with the summit shielding Clark.
</P>
<P>
Prevailing winds are also away from the base.;    "I'm not so concerned," said
Pauline Lord, Harlow's wife. "My husband is not unaccustomed to danger.";   
Lord said Harlow's love affair with volcanoes began when he was an
undergraduate student at Dartmouth College and his professor took the entire
class to observe an eruption in Guatemala.;    "He's somebody who's fascinated
by that kind of energy," said Lord, a psychotherapist who has accompanied
Harlow to several volcanoes. "It's wonderful to see that lava sloshing
around.";    Harlow's 5-year-old daughter, Megan, is not worried about her
father.;    "She knows Daddy is in the Philippines and that he's fixing a
volcano," Lord said.

  NEW EXPLOSIONS ROCK PHILIPPINES' MOUNT PINATUBO  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mount Pinatubo rumbled today with explosions that hurled ash and gas more than
12 miles high, and a typhoon brought heavy rain that could unleash tons of
debris from the jagged slopes.;    Seven explosions were recorded from the
4,800-foot tropical volcano today, and scientists said more were expected.  
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Yunya, packing 80 mph winds, slammed into the eastern coast of
Luzon island, which includes Mount Pinatubo, early in the day. But it quickly
weakened to a tropical storm with 60 mph winds by the time it was centered
about 70 miles east of the volcano.;    Still, heavy rains churned up by the
typhoon drenched Manila and the provinces near the volcano, raising fears of
mudflows that could bury whole towns up to 25 miles away.;    Meanwhile,
President Corazon Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that Americans
had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages
nuclear storage sites at Clark Air Base, abandoned Monday by nearly 15,000
Americans.;    The U.S. military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000
Americans who crowded onto Subic Bay Naval Base as a bizarre tropical blizzard
of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base Friday during a
third day of increasingly violent eruptions of Mount Pinatubo.;    Showers of
'mud drops';  "It looks like it's snowing outside," said military spokeswoman
Capt. Kim Urie. Headlights and street lamps were turned on at midafternoon as
a "dark, black cloud" passed over the giant Navy base and dropped a gritty
rain of "mud drops," she said.;    At least four people have died, 24 have
been hurt and four have been listed as missing since Pinatubo began erupting
Sunday, after lying dormant for six centuries, officials said. About 84,000
people, including Americans, have been evacuated.;    Police said 12 people
had been arrested for looting at Clark.;    Five explosions shook the mountain
early today, showering ash over a wide area and providing a spectacular
pre-dawn display of nature's fireworks against a backdrop of lightning and
rain.;    Friday, eight thunderous explosions shot a cloud of ash and steam
nearly 19 miles high.;    Friday's eruptions hurled ash over Clark, 10 miles
east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles southwest, where the Clark personnel
had been temporarily housed. Gray ash also fell in Manila, 60 miles south.;   
At Subic, base spokesman Robert Coble said generators had to be shut down from
time to time to clean out volcanic ash, plunging the base into darkness.;   
River temperatures rising;  Temperatures in local rivers were rising because
of the volcanic debris, officials said.;    After sunset, the volcano spewed
two streams of orange, glowing material from its crater in what scientists
thought was the first appearance of lava during the weeklong eruptions.;   
Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and
Seismology, said Friday's blasts were part of a single eruption, the largest
since Mount Pinatubo awoke Sunday from its 600-year slumber.;    A British
newspaper, the Guardian, reported Thursday that the Americans declared a
nuclear alert at Clark late Wednesday and informed governments in Manila and
Hong Kong that "a nuclear accident in the region was possible." But Aquino
told reporters the story was "baseless and purely fabricated.";    The United
States refuses to confirm or deny that it stores nuclear weapons in the
Philippines.;    Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus also said the eruption
should have no effect on talks on the future of Clark and Subic, where leases
expire Sept. 16. The talks are deadlocked over compensation and the duration
of a new agreement.;    Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo could remain active
for years if it follows the pattern of similar Philippine volcanoes. That
would leave Clark unusable.

  FORECASTING VOLCANOES
SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED MUCH IN THE PAST
DECADE  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE FIRST THREATS were subtle:;    Steam curling from a fissure. A flurry of
small earthquakes, too faint to be felt.  
</P>
<P>
The Mount Pinatubo volcano was slowly rousing from 600 years of sleep.;   
Two months ago, when the drama began, scientists knew almost nothing about
this drowsy Philippine giant, swaddled in thick jungle and ignored by the
hundreds of thousands of people living around its flanks.;    They didn't know
it had a habit of exploding with a force twice as great as the 1980 eruption
of Mount St. Helens in Washington - or that the debris from these eruptions
had covered much of what was now Clark Air Base.;    But with the first small
signs of trouble, researchers went on alert, throwing a network of instruments
around the restless mountain. And in a few frenzied weeks of investigation,
they learned enough to recommend evacuation of some 84,000 people.;    The
warning came just in time. A series of violent eruptions has rocked the
mountain since Wednesday, blowing ash and pumice 80,000 feet in the air and
sifting volcanic grit over villages 90 miles away. At least 101 people have
been killed, 150,000 Filipinos have crowded into refugee centers in Manila and
20,000 American military dependents and civilian workers are being evacuated
from the country. U.S. officials said the damage may lead them to permanently
close Clark Air Base.;    On Monday, scientists said much of the pressure
inside the volcano had dissipated and the worst may be over.;    Although
Pinatubo never erupted into the cataclysmic blow-up that some had feared, the
damage and death toll from related earthquakes, mudslides and falling ash and
pumice could have been far higher had scientists not recommended evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The successful forecast points up just how far the science of volcanoes has
come in the past decade.;    The basics are the same. Researchers still use
seismometers and other instruments to measure the trembling, quaking and
bulging of the ground that often spell danger.;    But the technology has
improved immensely:;    (check) Instruments are cheaper and more expendable,
so they can be deployed where they will do the most good - right in the path
of the volcano's fury.;    (check) The instruments continually beam data to
scientists who are waiting a safe distance away. Before, they had to visit
their instruments and collect the data by hand.;    (check) Information is
routinely analyzed by computer, allowing researchers to assess a situation
quickly - and to develop computer models for predicting the behavior of
volcanoes.;    Researchers have also made strides in interpreting what they
see. "Our biggest improvement has been in our own heads," said Peter Lipman, a
volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.;    These skills
were honed in a series of volcanic disasters that rocked the world over the
past decade.;    "The 1980s was a very interesting decade because of the
number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring
information," said Steven Brantley, a geologist with the survey's Cascades
Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash. "It was a rather remarkable decade,
really.";    Scientists say the eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed 57
people and caused $1 billion in property damage, triggered a renaissance in
volcano research.;    It alerted the American public to volcano hazards and
prompted a tenfold increase in government spending for volcano research and
monitoring, said geologist Robert Tilling of USGS in Menlo Park.;    As a
result, the survey opened two new volcano observatories. One, in Washington,
keeps track of active volcanoes in the Cascades Range of the Pacific Northwest
and Northern California, including Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount
Hood, Mount Baker, Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen. The second is in Alaska,
where Redoubt Volcano put on a spectacular show in 1989 and 1990. A third
observatory has been operating in Hawaii since 1912.;    American scientists
have since responded to a number of volcanic awakenings throughout the world,
from Galunggung in Indonesia to Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, improving their
ability to quickly evaluate volcano hazards. Such a quick response is crucial
because only a few dozen of the world's 500 active volcanoes have been
adequately investigated and monitored.;    "Now," Tilling said, "we can go in
there and literally overnight set up a seismic network, and start getting data
within a day or two.";    The blossoming research has in turn spurred
development of cheaper and more rugged instruments.;    Take tiltmeters.;   
Like glorified carpenters' levels, they are used to measure the bulging and
tilting of the ground as magma muscles its way toward the surface.;    A
decade ago they cost thousands of dollars each. But after Mount St. Helens
blew, scientists looked for cheaper models. One was developed by James
Westphal, a well-known astronomer and gadgeteer at the California Institute of
Technology, who patterned it after an idea used in missile guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
Now tiltmeters are inexpensive enough to place in areas likely to get wiped
out in eruptions.;    The humble seismometer has also grown more useful as
scientists learn to better interpret what it's saying.;    "Volcanoes are
probably the most complex structures you can find on this planet," said
Bernard Chouet, a seismologist at the USGS in Menlo Park.;    It's not unusual
for them to produce thousands of small earthquakes - but those quakes can
have a variety of causes. Most are innocuous, caused by the cracking of rock
above pools of magma that, for the moment, aren't going anywhere. But others
are ominous, reflecting the surge of magma toward the surface in preparation
for an eruption.;    In the past few years, Chouet said, seismologists have
learned to recognize distinctive tremors that mean an eruption is on its way.
</P>
<P>
These patterns were successfully used to forecast the 1989 eruption of Redoubt
Volcano in Alaska, as well as the current eruptions at Pinatubo.;    But even
though volcano warnings have proved far more accurate than earthquake
forecasts, they're far from foolproof.;    Some volcanoes give virtually no
warning. Even when they do, the decision to evacuate is difficult and
expensive. In the Philippines, for instance, vandals looted parts of Clark Air
Base that were left unguarded. Factories and businesses shut down; crops and
livestock were left unattended.;    This time the evacuation paid off,
possibly averting a number of deaths. But it won't always. In the end, every
volcano is a rugged individualist, with its own distinct patterns of activity.
</P>
<P>
Some wake up, make threatening noises for weeks or months, then drift back to
sleep.;    The burden of deciding whether to warn the public weighs heavily on
scientists.;    Randall White, another seismologist with the USGS in Menlo
Park, recalled how he felt while working near the freezing summit of
Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz six years ago.;    Struggling to hear their
instruments above the noise of nearby broadcast towers, he and his colleagues
warned local officials that an eruption was on its way. But their warnings
were vain. For reasons that are still unclear, the officials did not order an
evacuation, and 22,000 people died after lava spewed from the volcano, melting
glaciers and forming devastating mudslides.;    "I found it nerve-racking,"
White said. "We were literally afraid to go to sleep at night, thinking that
some technician would get the interpretation (of the incoming data) wrong, and
a lot of people would die.";  Tools give clues that can save lives;    The
basic tools of volcano monitoring are cheaper and more portable than they were
10 years ago. Scientists can move in fast and set up instruments that
continually broadcast readings, which are then analyzed by computer. This
allows quicker evaluation of volcano hazards - and forecasts that can save
lives.; 1. Surveying: Researchers measure the volcano, with optical
instruments or high-tech laser tools, to see if it is bulging or stretching as
a result of magma rising inside. They also put tiltmeters near the volcano's
vent to record changes in the slope of the ground.; 2. Pick and shovel:
Geologists dig through layers of old ash and lava to determine how often a
volcano erupted in the past - a clue to what it might do in the future. The
thicker and more extensive the deposit, the bigger the eruption.; 3.
</P>
<P>
Seismometer: Measures ground shaking. Volcanoes often produce swarms of small
earthquakes. Researchers are learning to distinguish ordinary earthquakes from
those caused by magma rising toward the surface - a sign of impending
eruption.; 4. Spectrometer: First developed to measure pollutants from factory
smokestacks, it is now also used to measure sulfur dioxide in the smoke
belched by volcanoes. Increasing levels of the gas may signal an impending
eruption. The amount of gas reflects the amount of magma beneath the volcano,
and thus the potential size of the eruption.;    Sources: Robert Tilling and

BEBY TOLENTINO said Monday that she had crossed herself and frantically
brought her hands together in prayer as the mudslide began to carry away the
neighborhood church.;    "People think that maybe God was trying to punish
us," said Tolentino, her hands and face coated with the talc-like volcanic ash
that has saturated the air since Mount Pinatubo began erupting last week. "I
hope it was not God."  
</P>
<P>
Her neighborhood was leveled. The Tolentinos and 100 other poor families
along the Albacan River in Angeles, a once-bustling city of 280,000 people in
the shadow of Mount Pinatubo, lost their homes Saturday in mudslides and
floods brought on by the volcano's powerful eruption.;    One resident, an
elderly man, drowned in the torrent of thick volcanic ash and rainwater.;   
Because of impassable roads and downed telephone lines, it was still
impossible Monday to determine the extent of the damage.;    The death toll
from the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, combined with a series of earthquakes
and torrential rains, increased to more than 200, according to Philippine
television. The Philippine Red Cross said at least 101 people had been
killed.;    The government estimated damage to property and crops at about
$200 million.;    Most of the deaths occurred when houses and other buildings
collapsed under the weight of as much as eight inches of ash and sand spewed
from the rumbling crater.;    Hundreds of people across the island of Luzon
were reported missing, while hundreds of thousands of others have been left
homeless.;    As many as 150,000 people fleeing the volcano were said to be
crowding into evacuation centers Monday night in Manila, the capital, about 50
miles south of the volcano.;    Volcano scientists continued to express a
careful optimism. Raymondo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute
of Volcanology and Seismology, said in an interview that while the volcano
remained a threat, the eruptions were "simmering down" and "significant,
critical eruptions are probably over.";    Manila's domestic and international
airports were scheduled to reopen today, three days after they were closed
because of concern that ash from the volcano would damage jet engines.;   
Despite the optimism from scientists, however, the exodus of families fleeing
the volcano area continued late Monday as buses and trucks caked with gray ash
jammed roads leading into Manila. The government has set up more than 100
makeshift shelters in churches, schools, army camps and gymnasiums in the
capital.;    In the wake of the eruptions, Filipinos are facing monumental
tasks. Food and clean drinking water were running low in the central and
southwestern portions of the main Luzon island, which bore the brunt of the
volcano's week of fury.;    Angeles was without electricity Monday and so many
stores and gasoline stations were closed that it was difficult to find food
and fuel.;    Dozens of angry residents stormed a row of food shops in the
city's market, forced open the doors with crowbars and carted away canned
goods and other items, police and witnesses said.;    "We will die of hunger
if we don't do this," one of the looters said.;    Fifteen people were
arrested after more than 100 pigs were stolen from a farm near Angeles.;
Another U.S. Navy flotilla steamed toward Subic Bay today to help speed the
American exodus, and Filipinos complained that their government failed to
prepare them for the devastating fury of Mount Pinatubo.;    "We were really
caught flat-footed. They had not expected anything of this magnitude," said
Gov. Bren Guiao of Pampanga province, where about 120,000 refugees were
seeking help.; "It's about time we left," said Lisa Hedland, wife of an Air
Force sergeant, as she prepared to board the cruiser Long Beach with her
15-month-old daughter. "It's been horrible this past week.";    For most
Filipinos fleeing the volcano, the journey to safety was less orderly and far
more difficult.;    "We have nothing except the clothes we are wearing," said
Solidad Santiago, a 41-year-old laundry worker from Angeles, who fled to a
Manila evacuation center Sunday with most but not all of her family.;    "Our
house collapsed because of the volcano," said Santiago, a widow, whose face
showed signs of the wrenching fear of the past week. "My oldest son stayed
behind to try to guard our possessions.;    "He should be here by now," she
said. "I have gone on the public address system here and called his name, but
there is never any response. I am very concerned. I pray he is safe.";   
Santiago and her family were among nearly 5,000 refugees who crowded Monday
into the shaded bleachers of a Manila sports stadium that is being used as an
evacuation center.;    The evacuees were provided with food - mostly
sausages, rice and crackers donated by local businesses.;    "We have lost
everything, but still I am happy, happy to be here," said Romayo Garcia, a
29-year-old mason, whose house near the now-evacuated Clark Air Base, about 10
miles east of Mount Pinatubo, had collapsed from the weight of volcanic ash.; 
"The rocks were as big as this," he said, bringing together his thumbs and
index fingers to make a circle five inches wide. "It was impossible to walk.
</P>
<P>
People panicked. We had to find a way to get out.";    Garcia said he and
several members of his family trudged nearly 20 miles through ankle-deep ash
until they found a truck driver willing to take them to Manila.
