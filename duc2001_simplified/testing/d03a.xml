  SUNUNU RIDES AGAIN; BUSH DEFENDS HIM
LIMOUSINE USE APPROPRIATE, PRESIDENT SAYS  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush was described as "upset, angry and perplexed" about use of a
government limousine by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, who left his
latest controversy behind Tuesday night and flew to Iowa aboard a corporate
plane for a GOP fund-raising event.; But today the president came to the
defense of his embattled chief of staff.  
</P>
<P>
Sununu created an "appearance problem" by using a government car to travel
to a New York stamp show, Bush said, but "given the circumstances, I think it
was appropriate.";    He added, however: "It doesn't set a precedent. It
doesn't say anyone that has access to a car can go anyplace that anyone wants
at any time.";    "I recognize, and I think the governor does, there's an
appearance problem," Bush said.;    But, he added, "The facts surrounding this
particular trip, this beating that he's taken, is unwarranted in my view."; In
Des Moines, Sununu vowed he would not take advice from "self-styled experts"
on how or when he travels.;    "You can't get here without traveling," Sununu
told a Republican fund-raiser. "I know that's a very complicated concept for
some.";    Sources said Tuesday that an angry Bush contacted a senior
political adviser Sunday to discuss how to handle the controversy after
learning of Sununu's decision to have a government car and driver take him to
New York last Wednesday. Sununu attended a rare-stamp auction and conducted
other personal business but no official duties there, officials said.;    Bush
apparently made his call after Sununu defended himself on television Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was Sununu's first appearance on a network program since revelations in
April about his extensive use of government planes for activities ranging from
visiting his dentist to skiing to trips to his home state of New Hampshire.;  
On Sunday, Sununu gave the same explanation for using the government car that
he had offered for using government planes - that he must be able to
communicate instantly with the White House in the interest of national
security.;    Sununu has been unable to fly on government planes for personal
business since Bush instituted new travel rules after the April controversy.; 
Sununu since has asked sponsors of political events at which he is to speak
to obtain corporate jets to take him to and from Washington. White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that direct solicitation of firms to
provide such planes would not be improper, although Sununu aides deny that he
asked directly for the planes.;    The car controversy has created new ripples
among Republicans who question whether Sununu recognizes that repeated
questions about his ethics reflect poorly on Bush, who vowed during his
campaign to bring a higher ethical standard to his administration and fight
even the appearance of impropriety among aides.;    One administration source,
echoing comments by many Republicans outside the administration, said Tuesday
that Sununu "has a total blind spot on the issue of ethics and public
service.";    While Fitzwater has defended the legality of using the car and
corporate jets, he would not offer an opinion on perceptions of impropriety.; 
"I can't make a judgment," he said, adding, "I don't know what happened" in
connection with the jets. Party officials in three states where Sununu has
made recent appearances said they, not the White House, asked corporations to
provide him planes.;    Sununu and Edward Rogers, his top personal aide, flew
to Des Moines Tuesday night on a corporate jet arranged by the Iowa Republican
Party so Sununu could address a fund-raising event, according to Randy
Enwright, the party's executive director.;    "Because of all the flak, we
wanted to make sure we did it right," he said. "We ran this by the White House
to make sure the company didn't have any business pending there.";    The
Kirke-Van Orsdel insurance company in Des Moines furnished the plane, Enwright
said, and the state party was to pay the firm about $2,000, the cost of two
round-trip, first-class commercial tickets.;    The New Jersey Republican
Party arranged last week for Beneficial Corp. of Peapack, N.J., to charter a
plane to fly Sununu here after a fund-raising appearance there, according to
party spokesman Bill Ulrey.;    After his personal business in New York last
Wednesday, Sununu had gone on to New Jersey for the fund-raiser, while his
driver returned alone to Washington. Beneficial had been prepared to fly
Sununu to and from the event, but Sununu changed his mind and took the car at
the last minute, officials said.;    White House officials said the local
press has raised the transportation issue on every Sununu trip since April,
reflecting how the controversy has played nationally. "Who's paying to get him
there is the first question they ask," an administration official said of
Sununu's travels.

  SUNUNU TRIES THE PATIENCE OF STRONGEST BACKER:
BUSH  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu was marching down a hall next to the
Senate chamber last fall when he encountered Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
walking in the opposite direction, trailed by a couple of reporters.;    Not
even pausing, Sununu barked at Brady to turn around and follow him. The tall,
patrician Brady stood stiffly in silence for a moment, obviously irked at
being addressed like a junior staff member, as Sununu continued walking
without waiting for a response.  
</P>
<P>
"No, no, John," Brady called out. "YOU'RE going the wrong way." Reproached,
Sununu reversed tracks and followed the Cabinet secretary.;    These days,
Sununu seems to be making a habit of going the wrong way: The latest flap is
over his taking a chauffeur-driven White House car to New York to attend a
stamp auction.;    And the abrasive chief of staff is discovering that the
dozens of people he has insulted or slighted - from administration officials
to members of Congress - are watching his travails with thinly disguised
relish.;    Before, Sununu could take comfort in unswerving support from the
person who mattered: President Bush. But now, that too is in doubt.;    Bush
gave Sununu a less-than-ringing endorsement Wednesday, telling reporters that
the former New Hampshire governor has created an "appearance problem.";    And
suddenly, the political community is abuzz with questions about how long
Sununu will last in his job and how someone so bright could get himself in so
much trouble.;    Sununu's latest problems stem from his use of his official
car to go to New York for a stamp auction. There was nothing illegal about the
trip, or Sununu's ride home on a corporate jet after attending a GOP
fund-raiser in New Jersey later that night.;    But the incident raises
questions about Sununu's judgment because it came only a few weeks after
reports of his use of government jets for personal and political purposes.;   
Besides triggering a spate of unflattering attention, those reports prompted a
new, more-restrictive White House travel policy that required Sununu to get
advance approval for his flights.;    The latest flap has dominated White
House briefings the past two days and prompted Bush to suggest Wednesday that
Sununu shouldn't use his government car for such purposes again.;    "I
recognize, and I think the governor (Sununu) does, there's an appearance
problem," said Bush, who nonetheless defended Sununu's use of the car as
permissible in this case and said Sununu's job was safe.;    White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, amplifying Bush's comments, made it clear that
Bush had told Sununu that he was concerned by the appearance of impropriety
and that he wanted his chief of staff to take no more embarrassing trips.;   
Fitzwater said Bush expects such use of a White House car to be "a
one-time-only thing. . . . We only expect it to happen once.";    The
controversy is unquestionably an embarrassment for Bush, who has prided
himself on setting a high ethical standard for his administration. And some
former White House officials say Sununu should recognize that he is not
serving Bush well.;    "In light of his problems with his jet travel and all
that, he ought to be a little careful," said Lyn Nofziger, a White House
political director under Ronald Reagan. "If not for his sake, then for the
sake of the president. It's the president who has to run for re-election next
year, not John Sununu.";    As Sununu himself has noted, some of the criticism
goes with the job of saying "no" to administration officials and lawmakers who
want the president's ear.;    "Somebody has to be the tougher hand, the firmer
hand. It goes with the territory," Sununu said last month.;    But critics
complain that Sununu's brusque style has alienated Republicans and Democrats
needlessly, causing unnecessary ill will.;    He publicly dismissed Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., as an "insignificant figure" last year during the budget debate
on Capitol Hill. He has enraged House Republicans by dressing them down
privately and questioning their political skills.

  CAN SUNUNU AVOID SHERMAN ADAMS' FATE?  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HE WAS Washington's "Abominable No-Man," the White House chief of staff who,
according to Time magazine, "refuses to waste a second, even for such
amenities as 'hello and goodbye.' ";    He was a former two-term New Hampshire
governor who daily greeted aides with an abrupt, "What are you doing for your
country."  
</P>
<P>
According to one writer, "He said no to cabinet secretaries and to
congressmen, to journalists and to job-hunters; he said no short and sharp
without troubling to be polite about it; and so he would come to be warmly
detested on the Hill, in the National Press Club, at Republican National
Headquarters and across the country." And his improprieties, when they were
revealed, shocked the nation and rocked the administration to its very
foundations. And he wasn't even named John Sununu.;    But the rise and fall
of Sherman Adams, President Eisenhower's powerful chief-of-staff, is more than
an interesting political doppleganger to the travails of his lineal heir, John
Sununu. The case of Sherman Adams sheds an eerie light on Sununu's rise in the
ancient, stony soil of New Hampshire politics. It gives us a grip on the
origins of the presidential chief of staff, an unofficial position that has
come to be a virtual American prime ministership. And the course of Sherman
Adams' humiliation may even allow us a perspective on the course of John
Sununu's struggle for survival and possibly even a way to predict the timing
of his ultimate demise.;    That Sherman Adams, the first "assistant
president" and John Sununu, conceivably the last of the imperial chiefs of
staff, were both catapulted from governor of the Granite state into national
prominence is not at all coincidental. Rather it stems from the strange
configuration of American politics and New Hampshire's place in it. With its
"first-in-the-nation" primary, New Hampshire has historically exerted a pull
far in excess of a population still only marginally larger than the city of
Detroit.;    Sherman Adams had risen in New Hampshire politics of the '30s and
'40s because of his organizational abilities and the perception of his
incorruptibility.;    After graduating from Dartmouth, Adams worked as a
logging camp supervisor and eventually rose to become an executive in one of
New Hampshire's leading timber companies. In 1940, at the behest of his
employers, he ran for a seat in the New Hampshire House, eventually becoming
governor in 1949.;    When he took office, Adams began a program of
streamlining and reducing state government that provided a model followed
three decades later for another new New Hampshire governor, John Sununu.;   
In late 1951, New Hampshire was the launching pad for the campaign of Dwight
D. Eisenhower.;    Eisenhower, with Adams' support, defeated the isolationist
Sen. Robert Taft in the New Hampshire primary. But Eisenhower and Taft ran
neck and neck in subsequent state tests and arrived at the Republican
Convention in Chicago virtually tied. It was then that Eisenhower's top
lieutenants came to Adams and asked him to become their candidate's floor
manager.;    The 1952 Republican convention was the last national convention
to go beyond one ballot. And when Eisenhower did win, he asked Sherman Adams
to become his personal campaign manager.;    Bush's campaign debt;    In a
very similar way, three and a half decades later, George Bush paid off a very
major campaign debt by appointing Sununu chief of staff. Without Sununu, the
chances are very good that the current president of the United States would
not be named George Bush.;    In February 1988, a reeling Bush campaign limped
into New Hampshire after finishing a near-fatal third in the Iowa caucus. But
the savvy Sununu, evidencing some of the high arrogance for which he has
become justly famous, was not at all downcast. "Isn't it great," he reportedly
told a puzzled friend about the news in Iowa. "Don't you see how much good I'm
going to do for the next president of the United States?";    And true to his
words, Sununu crafted an attack campaign that painted Bush's chief rival, Bob
Dole, as a closet "tax and spend" liberal. That ploy, plus a computerized
get-out-the-vote campaign, crafted by Sununu on his own spreadsheet program,
did the trick, and the rest is history.;    Unlike Sherman Adams, John Sununu
could not be mistaken for a rock-ribbed Granite Stater. Born in Havana, Cuba,
the son of an immigrant Lebanese trader and a Greek mother from El Salvador,
the stubby, rumpled Sununu liked to refer to himself as a "universal ethnic.";
Three degrees from MIT;    But an upper middle-class New York upbringing, a
brilliant career at military school and three degrees from MIT put the reputed
180 I.Q. Sununu on the fast track. In the early '60s, he began building a
solid career running the several engineering firms he founded and also became
a professor of physics at Tufts University.;    Sununu was elected to the New
Hampshire Assembly in 1972, and 10 years later became governor of New
Hampshire on a conservative campaign theme of nuclear power, increased
business and no new taxes.;    It was a propitious era to be governor of New
Hampshire. The state was coming out of the '82 recession and beginning a
six-year boom that pumped enough revenue into the coffers to build a new state
hospital and prison and still have money left over to give state employees
raises. According to Concord Monitor editor Mike Pride, "Sununu did well; he
fell into an easy time to be governor.";    Sununu was re-elected twice and
gained a reputation as an activist governor.;    He also developed a
propensity for the excesses that would prove so costly in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Eschewing the mansion in Concord, Sununu chose to live an hour away from the
capitol and be chauffeured to and from every day. The Wall Street Journal
noted that Sununu "became an extremely powerful figure in a state where the
powers of governor are not great.";    More or less the same thing could have
been said about Sherman Adams when he gave up the New Hampshire governorship
to become Dwight Eisenhower's "assistant president" in 1953.;    The reason
for Adams' enormous power lay in the nature of the Eisenhower presidency.
</P>
<P>
Continuing the staff system that had proven itself during the war, Adams noted
that "Eisenhower simply expected me to manage a staff that would boil down,
simplify and expedite the urgent business that had to be brought to his
attention." It also meant that Adams would decide who and what crossed the
president's threshold. This power as the presidential gatekeeper has
characterized the chief-of-staff position ever since.;    Adams managed to
keep the Eisenhower administration on a more or less even keel through the
worst of the McCarthy outrages, through Eisenhower's heart attack in 1955, the
Suez crises in 1956, the Little Rock school integration crimes in 1957 and the
invasion of Lebanon in 1958.;    According to Eisenhower, Adams was successful
because "From our first meeting in 1952, Sherman Adams seemed to me best
described as laconic, abrupt, businesslike and puritanically honest." Adams
was the shining example that Republicans could hold up that they had done
something about their 1952 campaign slogan to "clean up the mess in
Washington.";    Thus, the spring 1958 revelations that Adams had for years
enjoyed free hotel accommodations and accepted the now legendary vicuna coat
and an expensive rug from an unsavory New England industrialist named Bernard
Goldfine, while at the same time interceding with regulatory agencies on
Goldfine's behalf, came as a major shock.;    Adams waged a vigorous and
seemingly successful defense before a congressional committee, asserting that
his worse crime had been "a mistake of judgment, not of intent.";    And there
things stood throughout the summer of 1958, with a somewhat tarnished Adams
carrying out the role he had defined over the previous six years. When pressed
about Adams, the president insisted that he was his "right-hand man . . . the
only man who really understands what I am trying to do." And when really
pressed about why he kept Adams on, Eisenhower wailed at a press conference,
"I need him.";    In 1958, an Eisenhower administration without Sherman Adams
was unthinkable. Certainly more unthinkable than a Bush administration without
John Sununu. But as the summer of '58 progressed, it became clear that Adams
was becoming an issue that could help the Democrats. So when, in September
1958, Republicans were badly beaten in elections in Maine, and campaign
contributions began to dry up, the pressure on Eisenhower to do something grew
enormous. But Eisenhower refused to personally fire his aide. Instead, he
delegated Vice President Nixon and the chair of the Republican Party to visit
Adams.;    Ever the good soldier, Adams finally listened, and in late
September quit. The gesture was largely futile. The year 1958 was the
beginning of the Democratic renaissance that led to the election of John
Kennedy in 1960.;    Today, as Vice President Dan Quayle could tell you, John
Sununu is no Sherman Adams. Sununu is as brash as Adams was self-effacing and
far more self-serving than Adams at his vicuna-coat worst. Nevertheless, the
continuing flap over Sununu's excesses and arrogance seem to mirror a
transgenerational anger at a public official who flaunted the Washington
establishment, who has made too many enemies trying too hard, and enjoying too
much, being the bad cop to the president's good.;    And even if a
controversial Supreme Court nomination has temporarily taken the spotlight off
of Sununu, the current chief of staff ought to ponder well next year's coming
election. He might question if his strange, parochial antics may just provide
the kind of ammunition in 1992 that the similarly alien behavior of Sherman
Adams did 34 years before. Ammunition that his own party will use to get rid
of him in time for an upcoming election if not before. (box)

  SUNUNU BATTLES TO KEEP HIS JOB  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of President Bush's sons has informed White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu that he has lost much of his support among Republicans, prompting an
intense effort by Sununu to hold on to his job by demonstrating his GOP
backing, White House and Republican sources said Monday.;   Sununu was told
Wednesday by Bush's son, George, that he had alienated members of the Cabinet,
the White House staff and the Republican political community, creating a
situation that puts his effectiveness in significant doubt, the sources said.  
</P>
<P>
The message to the chief of staff was meant to be taken as a suggestion
that Sununu offer to resign, one highly placed source said. Instead, Sununu
sought to prove to the president that his supporters outnumber his critics and
that he should remain in his post.;   One senior official Monday described the
White House as "a collection of small groups of aides holding their breaths,"
waiting to see whether Sununu survives. One GOP source, reporting on a call
from the chief of staff to a Republican leader, said Sununu lamented that "the
noose is tightening around my neck, and I need your help.";   Another highly
placed source said the president's son met with Sununu last week after holding
a series of conversations about the structure of the White House staff and of
the campaign with other Bush loyalists and GOP activists. The source said the
younger Bush "sketched out for Sununu" problems the president is encountering
because of the chief of staff's tenure.;   "He was told . . . the handwriting
was on the wall," the source said Monday.;   That, the source said, was when
Sununu started calling congressional Republicans and asking them to tell Bush
that the conservative wing of the party, in particular, would object if he
were fired.;   Officials said the president himself met with Sununu Sunday. A
source said the outcome of that session was unclear.

  SUNUNU QUITS AMID STORM OVER HIS ROLE
RESIGNATION RELIEVES BUSH OF A 'BURDEN'  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a stormy three-year tenure, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
resigned Tuesday, saying he did not want to be a "political burden" to
President Bush during his 1992 re-election campaign.;   The resignation,
effective Dec. 15, capped months of sniping by Democrats and even some
Republicans. Sununu, whose abrasive style left him with few allies and many
important enemies, was undone by political missteps that proved increasingly
embarrassing for Bush.  
</P>
<P>
Speculation on a successor immediately centered on Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner, a Bush favorite and loyalist considered hard-nosed but not as
curt and combative as Sununu. Skinner headed Bush's 1988 campaign in
Illinois.;   Others mentioned as possible candidates for the job were Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney; Craig Fuller, a Republican consultant who was Bush's
chief of staff when he was vice president; and longtime Bush adviser Frederic
Malek.;   As chief of staff, Sununu has been given wide latitude by Bush to
manage domestic policy issues while the president devoted his attention to
foreign affairs.;   Sununu offered his resignation in a handwritten letter
given to Bush as the president was flying on Air Force One from Washington to
Bradenton, Fla., on Tuesday morning.;   "I have always said I wanted to serve
as chief of staff as long as I could contribute to your success and help deal
effectively with both the issues and the arrows," Sununu wrote. "Until
recently, I was convinced that even with the distorted perceptions being
created, I could be a strong contributor to your efforts and success.;   "But
in politics, especially during the seasons of a political campaign,
perceptions that can be effectively dealt with at other times can be - and
will be - converted into real political negatives. And I would never want to
not be contributing positively, much less be a drag on your success.";   Bush,
in a "Dear John" letter in response, praised the 52-year-old Sununu and said
he wanted him to stay in the White House as a counselor with Cabinet status
through March 1.;   "You have never wavered in your loyalty to us and more
importantly, your loyalty to the principles and goals of this administration.
</P>
<P>
You have indeed helped with the issues and you have intercepted many of the
'arrows' aimed my way," Bush said.;   Later, standing beside Sununu on Air
Force One, Bush told reporters, "He has taken a lot of hard shots that would
have landed on my chin.";   Despite the effusive praise from Bush, Sununu's
resignation came after Bush's son, George, informed Sununu last Wednesday that
he was becoming a liability. The conversation was reported Tuesday by the
Washington Post. Many political strategists saw the leak of the conversation
as a public signal to Sununu that he should resign.;   GOP consultant Charles
Black said it became clear Sununu had to go when he became the story and
prevented Bush's own message on the economy and other domestic issues from
getting through.;   "Every day the press was writing about Sununu and the
president wasn't getting anything done. . . . Hopefully the finger-pointing
and controversy is over and the president can focus on the domestic agenda,"
said Black.;   The resignation came amid Bush's struggle to arrest a sharp
decline in his public approval rating, fueled by persistent concerns that the
economy is headed into another recession and that the president has been
inattentive to domestic needs.;   One Sununu ally, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
suggested that Bush's popularity problems may have been a factor in Sununu's
departure. "I'd hate to think so, but that's certainly one possibility. That
job is the No. 1 flak-catcher, and when you catch enough flak you sometimes
get weighted down.";   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said
Bush shouldn't expect a White House shake-up to reverse his fortunes.
</P>
<P>
"Changing the nameplate of the president's chief of staff is not going to make
good things happen," he said.

  WHY HATCHET-MAN SUNUNU RESIGNED: POLITICAL
EXPEDIENCY  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one expected John Sununu to go gently. And he didn't.;   As his final act,
the man hired by President Bush to be his political hatchet man took a swipe
at the boss.  
</P>
<P>
Sununu submitted his resignation, effective Dec. 15, in a five-page
handwritten letter to Bush as they flew to Florida for a speech at a juice
factory Tuesday.;   The former New Hampshire governor, ending weeks of
speculation and criticism of his performance, told Bush in the letter he
"would never want to not be contributing positively, much less be a drag on
your success.";   In thinly veiled comments, Sununu made it clear that he felt
betrayed because, in many ways, he was doing exactly what Bush had hired him
to do.;   The departing chief of staff was also obliquely reminding the
president that this was not a matter of principle, but of ratings; his
bullying tactics had been fine as long as the opinion polls did not go down.; 
"I assure you that in pit-bull mode or pussycat mode (your choice, as
always), I am ready to help," Sununu wrote.;   His reference was sardonic. He
had called himself "a pussycat" and kept a plush cat on top of the bookcase in
his large West Wing office. But, at close range, it was clear that the toy
animal was really a tiger, and that is exactly how Sununu saw himself.;   As
he stated his credo in his first month in Washington: "I don't care if people
hate me, as long as they hate me for the right reasons.";   Bush and Sununu
formed a close bond during the 1988 campaign, in the snows of New Hampshire,
when Bush saw his presidential dream slipping away after a humiliating showing
in Iowa.;   "Whatever they did in Iowa, they will not reject George Bush in
New Hampshire," Sununu vowed, as he dragged Bush down from his elite perch to
start what he called a "see me, touch me, feel me" campaign among the people.;
But it was Sununu who embodied the barbed-wire side of Bush's politics; in
many critical ways, he was an accurate reflection of the way Bush believed
things should work.;   During the 1988 campaign, Bush conceded in interviews
that he had to do some of the dirty work in attacking Dukakis; his alternating
nice and nasty faces came to be known as "George the Gentle" and "George the
Ripper.";   But as president, Bush preferred to farm out to aides the duties
of bully and gunslinger.;   By making the abrasive former governor of New
Hampshire his chief of staff, Bush hoped that he could keep a certain balance
of rough and smooth in his governing and in his politics.;   In the many times
over the past three years when Sununu helped land the president in the
political soup, the Washington political cognoscenti speculated that Bush was
keeping his chief of staff only out of loyalty to Sununu for helping him win
the New Hampshire primary, or because Bush was too nice to fire anyone, or
because he was too indecisive.;   The truth is more complicated, and Sununu
put his finger on it Tuesday. While Sununu's lack of political skill in
dealing with political Washington eventually cost him his job, and while his
fatal flaw may have been in believing that he was smarter than Bush, the chief
of staff was - often in an inept way - trying to fulfill the mandate he had
been given by his boss.;   In many critical ways, Sununu exacerbated Bush's
limitations, rather than making up for them, and whenever the spotlight swung
away from foreign affairs, it became painfully apparent that this was a White
House without a long-range agenda, without a communications strategy and
without first-rate thinkers in many top jobs.;   As Bush tried to be the
ultimate Washington insider, the chief of staff alienated Congress, Cabinet
members, House Republicans and the press, who disdained Sununu because they
believed he misled them. Sununu even tried to manipulate his boss on occasion,
with the effect that Bush looked weak and waffling.;   When the glow faded
from the Persian Gulf war, and the country began looking to the White House
for leadership on the stagnant economy and the pain of many Americans, the
president once again allowed himself to be guided by Sununu and his closest
White House ally, Richard Darman, the budget chief.;   Sununu and Darman urged
the president to follow his instincts that there was nothing he could do about
the economy and that he should not even try to come up with a drastic plan.;  
Moreover, in the recent fiasco about caps on credit card interest rates,
Sununu did something that is never done in a city that operates strictly on
hierarchy: He blamed the mess on his boss, going on national television to say
Bush had "ad-libbed" the idea in a speech.;   Bush appeared out of sync with
the country. His approval ratings began dropping again. Important Republicans
scorned by Sununu began going on the record with their advice to Bush that he
was being ill served by his chief of staff.;   And finally and most important,
the president's wife, Barbara, and oldest son, George, turned on Sununu.;  
And so, finally, Bush invited Sununu to resign.;   In accepting Sununu's
letter of resignation, Bush said he regretted but supported Sununu's "good
decision." He said his aide would remain on at the White House until March 1
as a presidential counselor with Cabinet rank.;    Now Bush must find another
chief of staff, and another hired hatchet. But this time, his friends say, he
will look for aides who can play those roles while also playing by the rules
of the Washington game.;   While sources said Transportation Secretary Sam
Skinner headed the list of candidates, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said today he did not believe Bush had made the offer to Skinner.;   Others
said to be in the running were Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who was chief of
staff under President Ford; former GOP Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota; and
former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, a strong Bush loyalist who now is
president of Drew University.

  A POLITICAL HATCHET MAN GOES DOWN SWINGING  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one expected John Sununu to go gently. And he didn't.;   As his final act,
the man hired by George Bush to be his political hatchet man took a swipe at
the boss.  
</P>
<P>
In thinly veiled comments in his resignation letter, Sununu made it clear
that he felt betrayed because, in many ways, he was doing exactly what Bush
had hired him to do.;   The departing chief of staff was also obliquely
reminding the president that this was not a matter of principle, but of
ratings; his bullying tactics had been fine as long as the opinion polls did
not go down.;   "I assure you that in pit bull mode or pussycat mode (your
choice, as always), I am ready to help," Sununu wrote.;   His reference was
sardonic. He had called himself "a pussycat" and kept a plush cat on top of
the bookcase in his large West Wing office. But, at close range, it was clear
that the toy animal was really a tiger, and that is exactly how Sununu saw
himself.;   As he stated his credo in his first month in Washington: "I don't
care if people hate me, as long as they hate me for the right reasons.";  
Bush and Sununu formed a close bond during the 1988 campaign, in the snows of
New Hampshire, when Bush saw his presidential dream slipping away after a
humiliating showing in Iowa.;   "Whatever they did in Iowa, they will not
reject George Bush in New Hampshire," Sununu vowed, as he dragged Bush down
from his elite perch to start what he called a "see me, touch me, feel me"
campaign. He encouraged Bush to ride a snow plow and wander around a
snow-bound Nashua, shaking hands and offering to help skeptical motorists dig
out their cars.;   On the surface, they seemed like an odd couple - one tall,
slim and patrician, the other short, pudgy and ethnic; one well-groomed, the
other often slightly disheveled, with his shirt hanging out; one polite and
conciliatory, the other rude and contentious.;    But on matters of politics,
George Bush and John Sununu were not so oddly matched. Sununu embodied the
barbed-wire side of Bush's politics; in many critical ways, he was an accurate
reflection of the way Bush believed things should work.;    During the 1988
campaign, Bush conceded in interviews that he had to do some of the dirty work
in attacking Dukakis; his alternating nice and nasty faces came to be known as
"George the Gentle" and "George the Ripper.";   But as president, Bush
preferred to farm out to aides the duties of bully and gunslinger.;   By
making the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire his chief of staff, Bush
hoped that he could keep a certain balance of rough and smooth in his
governing and in his politics.;   In the many times over the past three years
when Sununu helped land the president in the political soup, the Washington
political cognoscenti speculated that Bush was keeping his chief of staff only
out of loyalty to Sununu for helping him win the New Hampshire primary, or
because Bush was too nice to fire anyone, or because he was too indecisive.;  
The truth is more complicated, and Sununu put his finger on it Tuesday. While
Sununu's lack of political skill in dealing with political Washington
eventually cost him his job, and while his fatal flaw may have been in
believing that he was smarter than George Bush, the chief of staff was -
often in an inept way - trying to fulfill the mandate he had been given by
his boss.;   Sununu was not proclaimed a failure from the start. Indeed, in a
May 1990 cover story called "Big Bad John Sununu," Time magazine said: "Sununu
has emerged as Bush's most inspired choice for any senior post. His brisk
certainty and willingness to take bold stands complement his risk-averse
boss.";   But in many critical ways, Sununu exacerbated Bush's limitations,
rather than making up for them, and whenever the spotlight swung away from
foreign affairs, it became painfully apparent that this was a White House
without a long-range agenda, without a communications strategy and without
first-rate thinkers in many top jobs.;   As Bush tried to be the ultimate
Washington insider, the chief of staff alienated Congress, Cabinet members,

And so, finally, Bush invited Sununu to resign.;   Now Bush must find another
chief of staff, and another hired hatchet. But this time, his friends say, he
will look for aides who can play those roles while also playing by the rules
of the Washington game.

<P>
Putting John Sununu and Ted Kennedy to work on a problem is like putting two scorpions in a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff, is a combative, conservative Republican with a history of ambushing liberal Democrats like Sen. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mr. Sununu has just finished going head to head with the Massachusetts senator - and succeeding in negotiating an agreement on landmark legislation giving sweeping new rights to disabled Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu was typically tough; at one point, he tracked down Sen. Kennedy on a boat for a blunt phone conversation to break a logjam in Senate-White House talks. 
</P>
<P>
Another White House negotiating session ran triple its scheduled length. 
</P>
<P>
In the end Mr. Sununu committed the White House's support to the legislation while winning some concessions to minimize the effects on small business - and a mutually acceptable bill now is whisking through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"His role on that {legislation} was really impressive, an impressive tour de force," Sen. Kennedy says. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he got involved, we were able to identify the key issues." 
As that encounter suggests, Mr. Sununu, the brainy former New Hampshire governor, has begun thriving in Washington even though his brusque style still rubs some people the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
His boss, President Bush, is enjoying high public approval, important legislation is moving ahead and Mr. Sununu's relationship with the president is strong. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the administration, aides say Mr. Sununu has grown more relaxed, more willing to delegate responsibility and surprisingly content to play the role of a detached broker in policy debates. 
</P>
<P>
This represents a significant change from the administration's rocky opening months, when some wondered whether the new chief of staff would survive. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu was pilloried as John Tower's nomination as defense secretary went down in flames, as an ill-advised idea to charge fees on savings and loan deposits blew up in the administration's face and as the process of filling government jobs bogged down. 
</P>
<P>
Many political analysts here believe that Mr. Sununu has moderated his brash style, and that the former governor has adjusted to his White House role. 
</P>
<P>
But the relentlessly self-confident Mr. Sununu claims that it is Washington that has changed - that the rest of the city has accustomed itself to the deliberate pace that Mr. Bush chose for tackling thorny problems like the savings-and-loan mess, air pollution and arms talks with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this administration takes pains to work hard to make sure the whole is built up of a lot of pieces done in exactly the right way," Mr. Sununu says. 
</P>
<P>
He likens the Bush style to the process of forming a mosaic by carefully putting in place small parts one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the good feelings that are out there now are reflective of the fact that people are beginning to appreciate that the pieces are coming together," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu was a hard-charging governor who ran the New Hampshire statehouse with an iron hand, earning Mr. Bush's trust when he engineered a crucial victory in the 1988 New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the initial fears of some in Washington, Mr. Sununu insists, he has carefully avoided using his powerful new post to be a "gatekeeper" who blocks others from the president. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, cabinet members and other advisers have enjoyed unusually broad access to the president. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Mr. Sununu is proving more adept than expected at reining in his personal views and instead brokering compromises among other advisers. 
</P>
<P>
In the last stages of preparing Mr. Bush's mammoth Clean Air Act proposals, for instance, Mr. Sununu called together Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly and White House staffers for a marathon meeting to craft a compromise settling a dispute over regulations to cut auto emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Reilly recalls that in a private chat later, Mr. Sununu, an engineer in his own right, disclosed that he still harbored reservations about one small piece of the bill but had chosen not to push his personal view. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not preparing this legislation for you or for me. 
</P>
<P>
It's for him {Mr. 
</P>
<P>
Bush}," Mr. Sununu explained. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Mr. Reilly: "Contrary to what some people had feared, that he would simply impose his own view because he's a strong man, I don't have the sense that he did that." 
Despite such deft internal maneuvering, though, some Democrats and Republicans alike suspect Mr. Sununu, with his combative style, still may be accumulating too many enemies for his own good. 
</P>
<P>
This was particularly evident during the Tower debacle, when Mr. Sununu privately lashed out at Sam Nunn, the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee who led the fight against Sen. Tower, threatening to sour the administration's relations with this critical lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
And although the White House chief of staff has toned down since that early encounter, in a recent meeting with GOP House members, Mr. Sununu suggested that Republicans attack a crime package proposed by Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware - chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee - as "mostly plagiarism," because it allegedly stole ideas from Mr. Bush's plans. 
</P>
<P>
The charge offended Sen. Biden, whose presidential campaign last year collapsed amid charges that he had plagiarized speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The senator was particularly rankled because he carefully backed up his crime plan with a 50-page appendix crediting others with many of the ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu's charges reportedly led to an acrimonious telephone confrontation between the two men, who refuse to discuss the episode. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Biden does say that when Mr. Sununu has "substantive differences" with someone, "the inclination is to respond with personal attacks - which is bush league, no pun intended. 
</P>
<P>
It surprised me." 
Mr. Sununu also rankled some Republican congressional leaders by dressing them down at a recent White House meeting for failing to properly support Mr. Bush's programs. 
</P>
<P>
And a group of conservative supporters was stunned at another meeting when one conservative began raising a concern about personnel issues, only to be cut short by Mr. Sununu, who snapped: "Get your facts straight." 
Mr. Sununu suggests that sometimes when he knocks heads he does so because it's part of the job of being the top aide to a president who doesn't like to knock heads himself. 
</P>
<P>
"There are natural obligations that I have to be willing to carry out," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes with the territory." 
One group Mr. Sununu has generally succeeded in pleasing is conservatives, who view him as their champion in a generally moderate White House. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu does appear ready to move in when he thinks conservative principles aren't being followed adequately. 
</P>
<P>
When the Supreme Court rendered its controversial decision curbing abortion rights, for instance, lower-ranking staffers recommended that the White House avoid commenting on the politically explosive decision. 
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Sununu rejected that advice, ordered up a lengthy statement reiterating Mr. Bush's opposition to abortion, then read the statement personally to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
And whatever his relations with others, Mr. Sununu's most important relationship - the one with President Bush - appears sturdy. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu is confident enough, for example, to weigh in on foreign-policy as well as domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges arguing that Mr. Bush should propose even deeper cuts in U.S. and Soviet conventional forces than those he ultimately proposed this spring. 
</P>
<P>
And Mr. Sununu is comfortable enough with Mr. Bush to pull an occasional practical joke. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Mr. Sununu and two other advisers were sitting in front of Mr. Bush's desk waiting for the president. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to Mr. Sununu that the sight of three aides staring at an empty presidential chair was reminiscent of the Doonesbury cartoon strip that lampoons Mr. Bush by portraying him as a transparent wisp of air. 
</P>
<P>
So he had a White House photographer snap a shot of the scene, later inscribed the picture accordingly and gave it to Mr. Bush - who was so amused he immediately hurried to the White House press room to show it off.

   Sununu Will
   Continue to Use
   Corporate Jets

WASHINGTON - White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has
used five different corporate jets to travel to Republican
fund-raisers in the past six weeks, and the White House said
he will continue to use such jets rather than government
planes for political travel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bush said Mr. Sununu's use of a
government limousine for a trip to a stamp auction in New
York last week had created an "appearance problem." But Mr.
</P>
<P>
Bush, in his most extensive comments so far on Mr. Sununu's
controversial travel practices, also strongly defended his
chief of staff. The president denied he was angry with Mr.
</P>
<P>
Sununu and said his job was safe.
In response to questions about Mr. Sununu's recent shift
to use of corporate jets in the wake of restrictions imposed
last month on his use of government planes, the White House
released the list of five jets the chief of staff has used
for travel to fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
The identity of owners of two of the jets already had been
publicized, and the others are not large national
corporations. White House counsel C. Boyden Gray's office
approved all the travel in advance, and he vetoed some
suggested corporate jets because of potential conflicts of
interest, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
Use of corporate jets for political travel is legal
provided the corporation is reimbursed for providing the ride
or reports the travel as an "in-kind" political contribution.
</P>
<P>
Reimbursement for Mr. Sununu's travel often is made by the
host of the political fund-raiser he is attending.
</P>
<P>
The White House list said that on May 20 Mr. Sununu used a
corporate jet provided by Donald Bryant, a benefits and
insurance executive, to travel to a St. Louis fund-raiser for
Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft. On June 7, Mr. Sununu used a jet
provided by Fiber Materials Inc. of Biddeford, Maine, to
travel to a fund-raiser for the Maine Republican party.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu used a jet provided by three individual owners
- identified by the White House as Howard Bender, Martin
Bender and John Mason - to travel to a Chicago fund-raiser
June 11. The next day, as previously reported, Mr. Sununu
used a jet provided by Beneficial Corp., a financial
management and planning concern, to return from a fund-raiser
for the New Jersey state party. He had taken his White House
limousine to reach nearby New York to attend a stamp auction
before that event.
</P>
<P>
And, as also previously disclosed, Mr. Sununu used a jet
provided by KVI, an Iowa insurance brokerage firm, to travel
Tuesday to a fund-raiser in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu has resorted to regular use of corporate planes
for political travel in the wake of controversy over his
heavy use of costly government aircraft for political and
personal travel in the past two years. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said that use of corporate planes for
political purposes is a "well-established practice" that Mr.
</P>
<P>
Sununu will continue.
</P>
<P>
President Bush rose to the defense of his embattled chief
of staff, while also making clear he is chagrined about the
travel controversy. The president said that Mr. Sununu is
"doing a first-class job" and that there is a "piling-on
syndrome" feeding the publicity about his travel.
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Bush, who spoke to reporters before a White House
meeting as Mr. Sununu sat nearby, also seemed to suggest that
he would like his chief of staff to avoid creating new travel
controversies. "I think when you have an appearance problem,
I think all of us would agree you want to try to avoid it as
much as possible, and I think all of us have," he said.

   Voters in Poll Say Sununu Should Stay
   In Post, Though Negative Rating Rises

WASHINGTON - Embattled White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu, fighting for his political survival, has a rare bit
of good news: While Americans generally don't approve of his
actions, most don't think he should resign.
</P>
<P>
In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, voters were
asked whether charges of inappropriate use of government and
corporate transportation by Mr. Sununu are so serious that he
should resign. More than 80% of the voters surveyed were
aware of the flap, and among them, a clear majority, 58%,
said the assertions aren't serious enough for him to resign.
</P>
<P>
Just 33% said he should quit. The remainder either didn't
have an opinion or refused to answer.
Even among Democrats, 49% didn't think he should resign,
while 42% thought he should.
</P>
<P>
That hardly means Mr. Sununu is out of the woods, of
course. Though President Bush says Mr. Sununu's job is safe
for now, the ruckus over the chief of staff's extensive use
of government and corporate jets and cars has brought to the
surface a host of Sununu enemies who are likely to keep
gunning for his demise.
</P>
<P>
And while voters aren't clamoring for Mr. Sununu's head,
they have formed a more negative impression of him. The
survey found that 41% of voters have a negative view of the
chief of staff, while just 10% said they have positive
feelings. Last October, the view wasn't so clearly negative.
</P>
<P>
Then, just 20% said they had negative feelings about Mr.
</P>
<P>
Sununu, while 18% reported positive feelings.
</P>
<P>
The Journal/NBC poll was conducted jointly by Democratic
pollster Peter Hart and Republican pollster Robert Teeter.
</P>
<P>
They canvassed 1,006 registered voters by telephone from last
Saturday through Tuesday, a period when the latest flap over
Mr. Sununu's failure to inform the White House counsel's
office accurately about the procurement of a corporate jet he
used to attend a Chicago fund-raiser was in full swing.
</P>
<P>
The poll's findings are likely to fuel arguments by Mr.
</P>
<P>
Sununu's supporters that the controversy over his travel
isn't being taken as seriously in the country at large as it
is inside Washington.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu admitted that he made mistakes in using
government planes and his White House car for personal and
political business, and he has adopted a low profile. He
appears to be calculating that he can ride out the storm.
</P>
<P>
The criticism isn't likely to stop, though. Enemies of the
combative Mr. Sununu are trying to capitalize on his weakened
position to hurt him, largely through anonymous criticisms
and attacks. Some administration aides and Republican
strategists are arguing, for instance, that he now is a clear
political liability and should be pushed aside before Mr.
</P>
<P>
Bush's re-election campaign gets into full swing.
</P>
<P>
There also is quiet lobbying against Mr. Sununu by
Israel's supporters, who long have been suspicious of him
because of his links to Arab-American groups and his refusal
as governor of New Hampshire to endorse a proclamation
condemning a United Nations vote equating Zionism with
racism. Israel backers, for instance, have been circulating a
1988 proclamation he signed as governor honoring the crew of
the Liberty, a U.S. ship attacked by Israeli forces under
murky circumstances during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

WASHINGTON - John Sununu resigned as White House chief of
staff, ending his struggle to remain within President Bush's
inner circle.
</P>
<P>
During a flight to Florida on Air Force One, the president
in effect forced the feisty chief of staff to submit his
resignation. The move comes at a time when Mr. Bush's
popularity ratings are slipping and he is under attack for
his handling of the economy.
But Mr. Sununu's removal may not solve the president's
immediate problems. Instead, it could exacerbate the
criticism from the right, where conservatives are
increasingly expressing their doubts about the president, and
where his renomination is under challenge. Moreover, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Sununu's ouster is unlikely to result in any major changes in
Mr. Bush's economic policies, which have attracted much
criticism recently.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the final year of Mr. Bush's first term now
hinges on whom he picks to be his White House chief of staff
and whom he chooses to run his re-election campaign. One
high-ranking official said Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner is almost certain to get one of those two jobs -
probably the chief of staff position. Mr. Sununu previously
was offered the opportunity to switch jobs with Mr. Skinner,
administration officials say, but turned it down.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Skinner has the advantage of an easy working
relationship with Mr. Bush and has been a respected political
adviser on issues beyond his transportation portfolio. He has
also developed a strong relationship with Vice President Dan
Quayle. Moreover, while Mr. Bush is under attack for lack of
attention to domestic policy, Mr. Skinner can claim credit
for shepherding major highway and mass transit legislation
through Congress.
</P>
<P>
But conservatives complain Mr. Skinner is a pragmatist in
Mr. Bush's mold rather than a true conservative. In his first
year in office, for example, he angered conservatives by
declining to use his authority to relax fuel economy
standards for autos; more recently, he has vigorously fought
any tightening of those standards. Moreover, top Republicans
on Capitol Hill, as well as some administration officials,
say Mr. Skinner has a penchant for abrasiveness, although he
is hardly Mr. Sununu's equal on that score.
</P>
<P>
Another person mentioned for the chief of staff post is
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Many prominent Republican
politicians as well as businessmen would love to see him get
the job. The defense secretary is widely credited for his
performance during the Persian Gulf War and is
well-remembered for his stint as chief of staff under Gerald
Ford a decade and a half ago. But the conservative defense
secretary has said he wouldn't take the job again under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Former Rep. Bill Frenzel, a close friend of the
president's, is also mentioned as a possible choice. And GOP
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas called the president aboard
Air Force One yesterday and urged that Carla Hills, the U.S.
trade representative, be given the job.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu will leave his current post Dec. 15 and become
a special presidential counselor with cabinet rank until
March 1.
</P>
<P>
The end of Mr. Sununu's reign at the White House came
without the blustery self-confidence that was the mark of the
governor's suzerainty. In the past several days the chief of
staff, who sometimes seemed to regard members of Congress as
his staff, and who regularly dismissed suggestions from
Republican political strategists, became a suitor rather than
an aggressor. He was almost desperately casting around for
support in the official Washington circles that he
disregarded only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
By the time he and the president agreed on his departure,
Mr. Sununu, who made self-confidence a badge of honor, was
despondent. Hours earlier, he had told confidantes that his
departure was assured. But even as he made telephone calls
around the country he was still seeking signs of support,
often from those he had spurned in office.
</P>
<P>
The Sununu saga lasted so long in part because of his
survival instincts - honed as much in the halls of academe
while a professor at Tufts University as in the austere state
house on a Concord hill. The former governor's extended
tenure also reflected the president's unwillingness to
dismiss people who have served him with loyalty. It was,
after all, Mr. Sununu who salvaged Mr. Bush's flagging GOP
nomination struggle in 1988, when he assembled an impressive
political organization that beat back both Sen. Robert Dole
of Kansas and the conventional political wisdom in the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
But while Mr. Sununu's resignation may have been
personally painful for Mr. Bush, the president apparently
decided it had become necessary to respond to mounting
criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for his
administration's handling of the country's economic problems,
and to increasing disquiet from his political advisers who
were concerned about his slippage in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, administration officials say it's unlikely
Mr. Sununu's departure will mean major changes in economic
strategy. Nor is it likely to please the White House's
conservative critics, who frequently relied on Mr. Sununu to
push their causes. Two influential GOP lawmakers, Rep. Henry
Hyde of Illinois and Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, even took
the unusual step of calling a news conference yesterday to
voice their support for him.
</P>
<P>
But despite Mr. Sununu's ties to conservatives, he had in
recent months abandoned their economic agenda. One
administration official noted that Mr. Sununu was among those
who argued most strongly against reopening the fight over a
capital gains tax cut this year; he argued it would subject
Mr. Bush to unnecessary and unproductive political heat.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu, said the official, "is really more of a
pragmatist." Another administration official, however, said
Mr. Sununu's departure may force Mr. Bush to get more
involved in economic issues. Mr. Sununu had sometimes denied
access to officials who wished to talk to the president about
economic and domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
One area where Mr. Sununu's influence was clearly felt was
abortion, where he held the administration to a stringent
antiabortion stance. Anti-abortion groups were among the
first to express regret over Mr. Sununu's departure.
</P>
<P>
According to several adminstration officials, Mr. Sununu
also encouraged Mr. Bush to take a firm position on issues
where Mr. Bush had no strong views, such as vetoing
appropriations bills for the District of Columbia that
allowed it to use its own, locally generated funds for
abortions for poor women.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Mr. Sununu became a favorite of many social
conservatives who distrusted Mr. Bush's roots in the moderate
wing of his party. His departure is likely to increase their
suspicions, unless Mr. Bush names a successor who is viewed
as a conservative.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu began to face rough political waters a year ago
when, as one of Mr. Bush's chief negotiators on the deficit
reduction agreement, he bruised congressional egos from both
political parties with heavy-handed lobbying and what many
saw as disregard for their stature as elected
representatives. Earlier this year he made headlines again
when his extensive use of government airplanes for political
and personal travel became public.
</P>
<P>
The Sununu saga ended with a handwritten note to Mr. Bush
on a trip that Mr. Sununu knew would seal his fate.
</P>
<P>
The White House said the chief of staff had offered to
resign in the Oval Office Monday, but the matter apparently
wasn't resolved. Mr. Sununu, according to associates close to
him, planned to confront the president on his trip yesterday,
asking him for an expression of 100% support to be made both
privately and to the White House press corps when Air Force
One returned to Washington.
</P>
<P>
He knew that without that expression of full support, he
would have to depart.
</P>
<P>
The president had already been searching for a way to ease
Mr. Sununu out of his post gracefully. That effort, however,
had faced formidable obstacles. The former governor was cool
to the idea of accepting a cabinet position even in the early
days of the Bush transition, and indicated that such a move
would be unacceptable now.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Republican political strategists
calculated that Mr. Sununu would be a liability in the
national campaign structure because of an abrasive operating
style that had alienated longtime Bush allies. And the
suggestion of dispatching him back home to New Hampshire to
run the re-election campaign was blocked when Mr. Bush
decided to have his campaign there run by former GOP Gov.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Gregg and his son, current Gov. Judd Gregg, both of whom
regard Mr. Sununu with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
The Greggs, in fact, scheduled a meeting for this evening
in the governor's mansion to plan strategy for the New
Hampshire primary, where Mr. Bush faces a challenge from
conservative columnist Pat Buchanan. "It's a Gregg
operation," said a leading New Hampshire Republican.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Mr. Sununu's departure came in
Meridian, Miss., where the White House distributed
photocopies of the handwritten resignation letter.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater didn't answer
reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Mr. Sununu hailed the "chemistry,
friendship, caring and irreverence" he encountered during his
tenure in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
But the letter also contained elements of the traits that
led to his downfall. He seemed to indicate that Mr. Bush's
wishes had dictated the combative style that made him so many
enemies in Washington. He said he remained "ready to help . .
. in pit bull mode or pussycat mode (your choice, as
always)."
The comment echoed the latest episode that had called Mr.
</P>
<P>
Sununu's effectiveness into question. Late last month, in a
television interview, Mr. Sununu suggested that President
Bush had erred by ad-libbing into a speech his view that
banks should lower credit-card interest rates. The result was
that a Republican lawmaker, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York,
swiftly introduced legislation that caused a furor in
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before boarding the presidential aircraft in
Mississippi, Mr. Sununu told reporters that he "knew the
rules of the game when he came to town." But his fall
yesterday reflected his ignorance of those rules and his
refusal to abide by them.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sununu, who plans to go into business to improve upon
his government salary, also obliquely noted the reputation
that has dogged his tenure: "I think you know that the
responsibility and authority (contrary to the legends out
there) never meant as much to me as the chance to assist you
to be (and to be recognized) a great President."
In his reply, Mr. Bush said he accepted Mr. Sununu's
resignation "with reluctance, regret and a sense of personal
loss."
