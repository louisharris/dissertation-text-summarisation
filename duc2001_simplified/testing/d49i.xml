<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
looking back on his work for Lincoln Savings and Loan Association,
says he doesn't believe he could have foreseen the thrift's
spectacular failure, expected to be the costliest in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
Nearly five years ago, Greenspan testified before Congress as a
private consultant and lobbied regulators on behalf of Lincoln and
its owner, Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
</P>
<P>
Keating objected to federal regulations restricting thrift
institutions' direct investments in real estate development.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, a conservative economist generally opposed to government
meddling in business, supported him.
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Greenspan said he was surprised and
distressed by Lincoln's eventual failure because of sour real
estate deals. But he said he still supports short-term direct
investments when thrifts are exposed to interest rate risks.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of direct investments have long argued that they can
benefit S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Ls struggling with a portfolio of long-term mortgages.
``I look back and I say to myself, `Was there something I should
have seen and didn't see?' and the answer is, `There was nothing
visible _ at least to me,''' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
In early 1985, Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln was a fast-growing
institution under aggressive managers who eschewed traditional
home-mortgage lending. Greenspan was a private economist with
impressive political credentials as President Ford's chief economic
adviser a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
Now, Lincoln is insolvent and under government control.
</P>
<P>
Regulators say it will cost taxpayers $2 billion to protect its
depositors, making it the nation's largest S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
L failure.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan is no longer a private consultant and, suddenly, his
five-year-old statements loom large. As chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, he is considered by many to be, after the president,
the most powerful official in the nation. The Fed influences daily
life, perhaps more than any other government agency, through its
manipulation of the economy and credit.
</P>
<P>
In a Feb. 13, 1985, letter to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco, Greenspan argued that Lincoln deserved an exemption from
regulations limiting to 10 percent thrifts' direct investment in
real estate and other commercial ventures.
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's management, he said, was ``seasoned and expert in
selecting and making direct investments'' with ``a long and
continuous track record of outstanding success.'' The institution
itself was ``financially strong,'' in a ``vibrant and healthy
state'' and ``present(ed) no foreseeable risk to the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, on Feb. 27, 1985, Greenspan told the House
Government Operations subcommittee on consumer, commerce and
monetary affairs that direct investments, while undoubtedly risky,
were essential for thrifts to diversify their holdings.
</P>
<P>
Traditional S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Ls, which took in short-term deposits and made
long-term mortgage loans, were vulnerable to a sharp rise in
interest rates and direct investments were a valuable alternative,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also endorsed a study by economist George Bentsen, now with
Emory University, which cited the success of 17 S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Ls in direct
investments. Fifteen of the 17 have since failed.
``It was my view then, as it is now, that interest rate risk was
the crucial problem confronting S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Ls _ the problem of long-term
assets financed by short-term deposits. In that particular context,
at that particular time, direct investment would reduce risk,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan still believes Bentsen took a ``rather sensible
statistical approach'' but he points out that most of the 17 S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Ls
cited in his study were located in Texas, later the center of the
oil and real estate bust.
</P>
<P>
The central bank chairman's views have been cited as one of the
reasons why a petition, calling on S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
L regulators to postpone
direct investment limits, attracted 225 signatures in the House in
early 1985.
</P>
<P>
It is also being cited as a reason why, two years later, five
senators decided to intervene with S
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
L regulators after Keating
complained about their efforts to examine Lincoln's finances.
</P>
<P>
The five _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain,
R-Ariz. _ met with the regulators in April 1987.
</P>
<P>
Two of them _ Cranston and McCain _ said Greenspan's views on
Lincoln's health heavily influenced their thinking.
``The problem, as conveyed to me at the time, not only by Mr.
</P>
<P>
Keating but also by Mr. Greenspan and Arthur Young 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co. (an
accounting firm) was that federal examiners bore substantial
responsibility for creating a most destructive and irrational state
of limbo for this institution,'' Cranston told the Senate Ethics
Committee in a Nov. 16 letter.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said he does not understand why the senators cite his
opinion as a reason for actions taken so long after it was given.
``You do not rely on a 2{-year-old letter unless you call the
guy who wrote it. No one ever called me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, as president of Townsend Greenspan 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co., was hired
to review Lincoln's condition by the New York law firm of Paul
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Garrison. He said he could not remember
how much he was paid for his work, but said he charged his usual
hourly rate.
</P>
<P>
The partners of the law firm, he said, were long-time, trusted
associates. ``They certainly never gave me the slightest impression
that these were other than good people'' at Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said he recalls meeting Keating himself two or three
times, but never for a detailed, analytical discussion. The people
working under Keating ``frankly I found fairly impressive,'' he
said.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Greenspan eyes the Democrats
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his youth, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was a
disciple of Ayn Rand, the ultra right-wing American novelist and philosopher
who stressed the moral, as opposed to economic, virtues of full-blown
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
According to Time magazine, in an article for Rand's journal the
Objectivist, Mr Greenspan once argued that the welfare state was 'nothing
more than a mechanism by which governments confiscate the wealth of the
productive members of society'. This was probably just youthful indiscretion
but Mr Greenspan is now having to adapt to an intellectual climate far
removed from Rand's social Darwinism.
</P>
<P>
This is not proving all that difficult. Mr Greenspan has always drawn a
sharp distinction between his private views and his duties as a public
servant. Although appointed to the Fed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan,
he has never been publicly associated with radical conservatism. Having
served in the mid-1970s as chairman of Gerald Ford's Council of Economic
Advisers, he is seen as a moderate Republican. At the Fed he has built a
reputation for non-partisan professionalism; only the odd hint of his
personal philosophy emerges, as, for example, in his opposition to any form
of capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and Mr Greenspan are circling each other warily. Mr
Clinton has stressed his support for the Fed's independence; Mr Greenspan
has promised to co-operate with the White House and has publicly praised the
president's deficit-cutting plan. However, as one of the few remaining
conservatives with real power, Mr Greenspan has become a target for
congressional Democrats. In recent hearings, he was denounced for failing to
cut interest rates quickly enough during the recession and for refusing to
pledge further easing of monetary policy in response to fresh efforts to
curb the deficit.
</P>
<P>
At times, as senators adopted the sarcastic tone of prosecuting attorneys,
the hearings took on an almost surreal aspect. Oblivious to encouraging data
(such as growth at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter), Mr
Paul Sarbanes of Maryland acted as if the Fed chief were on trial for crimes
against the state. When Mr Greenspan had the temerity to defend his record,
the prosecutor reeled off the names of eminent economists - such as Nobel
prize-winners Milton Friedman, James Tobin and Paul Samuelson - who had
publicly criticised him for doing 'too little too late'.
</P>
<P>
The attack on Mr Greenspan's economic competence was wholly unjustified.
</P>
<P>
With hindsight he has navigated treacherous economic seas with great skill.
</P>
<P>
He courageously raised interest rates in the late 1980s, thereby setting in
motion disinflationary forces. But he was sensitive to the risk of a
1930s-style financial meltdown and subsequently brought rates down faster
than conventional wisdom abroad (although not at home) thought desirable,
thus laying the ground for a quite vigorous recovery.
</P>
<P>
Of course, Mr Greenspan's curriculum vitae does not compare with those of
armchair theorists such as Friedman, Tobin and Samuelson. He has published
little and was finally awarded a PhD by New York University only in 1977 -
after he had served three years as chief economist under President Ford.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, by the silly standards applied to Mr Clinton's appointees, Mr
Greenspan was not qualified to be CEA chairman. Instead of seeking a
university chair, young Mr Greenspan founded his own Wall Street consultancy
and spent decades analysing the minutia of business cycles, in the process
gaining more practical wisdom than half a dozen professors.
</P>
<P>
Having handled the recession adroitly, he now faces even tougher challenges.
</P>
<P>
With inflationary pressures still low and the economy only just beginning to
gather momentum, monetary policy is currently tight enough. But if Mr
Greenspan wants to be remembered as the first Fed chairman for a generation
to secure something approaching price stability, he may need to raise
short-term interest rates substantially in coming years, certainly by 1995.
</P>
<P>
The scene is thus set for a bitter tussle of power with the Clinton
administration, which is unlikely to be enthusiastic about a sharp
tightening of monetary policy ahead of the next election.
</P>
<P>
Yet there is a more insidious threat. Since the US has never suffered a
hyperinflation, there is little popular support for Fed independence. Some
of Democrats are pressing for legislation that would increase Congress's
leverage over monetary policy. Democrats have long been unhappy about the
role played by the presidents of the Fed's regional branches. Often
monetarist by inclination, the regional presidents have five of the 12 votes
on the Federal Open Market Committee (the body that determines the level of
short-term interest rates). Yet, unlike Washington-based Fed governors, they
are not selected by the White House or subject to congressional
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Mr Clinton may mean what he says about Fed independence. But if the
electoral cycle proves more important, Mr Greenspan and his board (all
Reagan/Bush appointees) will face a painful dilemma. If the Fed resists
pressure for expansionary monetary policies, it may end up subject to
greater political control; if it does not, it risks higher inflation. It is
not an inspiring outlook for a man who prefers crunching data to playing
political poker.

FT  26 MAR 94 / Man in the News: Canny operator draws world's eye - Alan
Greenspan / The political skills of the US Federal Reserve chairman are
being tested
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As US interest rates rose another notch this week, traders in London and
other European financial centres were reminded that the German Bundesbank is
not the only star in the monetary firmament. The US Federal Reserve is still
the world's most powerful central bank and its decision to start tightening
monetary policy while many of America's trading partners are still
economically depressed has sent shivers through bond markets from New York
to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
It has also irritated the White House, which believes the Fed may be
overreacting to what are still only tentative signs of mild upward pressure
on inflation. Last week, President Bill Clinton summoned Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, to the White House for talks on economic policy. In
financial markets the ill-timed meeting was seen (perhaps unfairly) as a
blatant attempt to put pressure on Mr Greenspan. The Fed would probably have
increased rates anyway this week, but the administration's clumsy
intervention settled matters since inaction would have raised doubts about
the Fed's independence.
</P>
<P>
Critics fear that a tighter US monetary policy will slow the pace of
economic recovery which, on Main Street, is seen as having only just got
going. US banks are already raising their prime lending rates and mortgage
rates are up sharply, reflecting the steep increase in bond yields. The
Fed's action need not have much impact on growth overseas, but probably will
because European central banks are reluctant to see their currencies
depreciate against the dollar. To prevent depreciation, they may postpone or
abandon planned rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
Although the White House and the Fed disagree on policy, there is little
sign of personal animosity. As policymakers Mr Clinton and Mr Greenspan
share a love of detail; there is every sign that the White House appreciates
the quality of Mr Greenspan's economic advice, which many regard as the best
available in Washington. The Fed chief, a Reagan appointee in a city run by
Democrats, has also deliberately courted the Clintons. He sat next to
Hillary Rodham Clinton during the presentation of the White House economic
plan to Congress last year and subsequently pronounced the deficit-cutting
measures 'credible'.
</P>
<P>
Since the plan included the biggest tax increase on the wealthy in decades,
conservatives were infuriated. It seemed a strange lapse for a former
disciple of Ayn Rand, the ultra-libertarian author. But it stood Mr
Greenspan, a canny political operator, in good stead. So far, Mr Clinton has
refused to support congressional calls for legislation to reduce the Fed's
independence. And he has offered only lukewarm support for a Treasury plan
to strip the Fed of its powers as a bank regulator. Even on interest rates,
Mr Clinton is showing more restraint than George Bush, so far expressing
only mild misgivings in public about Fed policy.
</P>
<P>
Mr Greenspan has thus played his cards shrewdly. Administration officials
doubtless also appreciate the fact that the Fed chief, the most powerful
figure in international finance, is so willing to keep out of the public
eye. A fixture on the Washington media and political cocktail circuit (his
girlfriend Ms Andrea Mitchell is a reporter for NBC television), he often
meets privately with journalists. But he refuses to give on-the-record
interviews and unlike other top economic officials he never appears on TV
shows. The public knows him mainly through his dry, rather technical
testimony before congressional committees. The image he cultivates is of a
courteous, knowledgeable and pragmatic civil servant.
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, however, Mr Greenspan lets slip his private views and these
suggest a more radical temperament. For example, he advocates the abolition
of capital gains tax - not a view shared by many moderate Republicans. And
he recently shocked Democrats by admitting he was a bit of a gold bug. He
claimed that the gold price was a good indicator of inflation pressures and
even expressed nostalgia for the financial rigour induced by the 19th
century Gold Standard.
</P>
<P>
His views on the role of central banks are sometimes misunderstood. When Mr
Gordon Brown, the UK shadow chancellor, passed through Washington recently,
he naturally called on Mr Greenspan. Mr Brown's aides came out of the
meeting deeply impressed - Mr Greenspan apparently said the task of a
central banks was to promote economic growth as well as to control
inflation, thus distancing himself from the sterner rhetoric of his European
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to his audience, Mr Greenspan probably failed to add that his
recipe for stimulating growth is to push for zero inflation or 'price
stability' - not a policy that the British Labour party is likely to
endorse. Mr Greenspan defines price stability as inflation so low that it
can be ignored because it no longer interferes with the microeconomic role
of relative prices in guiding resource allocation. He does not think the US
has yet reached this goal even though many economists believe the true rate
of inflation is lower than the 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent shown by the
consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
If Mr Greenspan fears anything more than inflation, it is financial
instability. He reacted to the 1987 stock market crash in textbook fashion
by making unlimited liquidity available to endangered financial
institutions. He cut interest rates more rapidly in the early 1990s than
most central banks thought prudent because he feared the combination of
excessive borrowing in the 1980s and falling real estate prices might
threaten the stability of the US banking system. With hindsight the Fed's
policy looks finely judged: the US has emerged strongly from recession and
inflation, so far, has stayed subdued.
</P>
<P>
Cutting interest rates is easy. But Mr Greenspan has now embarked on what
may prove a long upward path. During the recession his 'gradualist' approach
-lots of small quarter or, occasionally, half point interest rate cuts -
worked well. If the financial markets discounted future cuts all well and
good: share and bond prices simply surged, providing an additional economic
stimulus. But Mr Greenspan is now discovering that gradualism on the way up
is a little more problematic.
</P>
<P>
The Fed hoped that by raising short-term rates promptly it would convince
markets that it was serious about preventing a resurgence of inflation as
the recovery matures. In theory greater confidence that inflation would
remain low ought to have countered upward pressure on long bond yields
caused by higher borrowing needs as companies expand capacity to meet
increased demand. But this has not happened mainly because markets are
betting that Mr Greenspan's gradualist strategy will involve many future
rate rises.
</P>
<P>
Some Wall Street analysts are urging the Fed to act more boldly. If, instead
of nudging rates higher, Mr Greenspan quickly raised rates to a 'neutral'
level consistent with sustainable non-inflationary growth, say 4-5 per cent,
markets might regain their composure. On this view, nothing is more
destabilising than the present 'drip drip' approach which critics dub
Chinese water torture.
</P>
<P>
While occasionally quibbling with his judgments, Wall Street nevertheless
regards Mr Greenspan as a class act. He has more than filled the shoes of
his admired predecessor Paul Volcker, partly because he brought diverse
qualities to the top Fed job: intimate knowledge of financial markets
gleaned from decades as a Wall Street consultant, mastery of economic
theory, and prior experience in public service - during the mid-1970s he was
chairman of Gerald Ford's council of economic advisers.
</P>
<P>
None of the people mentioned by Clinton aides as possible successors can
match this experience - another reason why nerves are on edge in financial
markets. For example, Mr Robert Rubin, the director of the National Economic
Council, is a respected former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, but he lacks Mr
Greenspan's economic expertise. Mr Larry Summers, the Treasury
undersecretary, is another potential candidate, but he lacks practical
experience of financial markets. And although he was an economics professor
he has a reputation as an inflation dove.
</P>
<P>
Mr Greenspan's critics should perhaps realise that the financial outlook
would be darker if he were less eager to nip inflation in the bud. US
interest rates might not be rising now, but if the economy was allowed to
hurtle into capacity constraints, they would eventually be forced into the
stratosphere. Unless Mr Clinton makes an inspired choice (which could
involve reaching out to a Republican), the expiration in 1996 of Mr
Greenspan's second term as Fed chairman could spell the end of a long period
of US monetary stability.

  GREENSPAN'S CAPITAL GAINS
FED CHIEF'S ROLE HAS CHANGED FROM SCAPEGOAT
TO WHITE HOUSE CONFIDANT  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along the hushed, marble corridors of the Federal Reserve Board's graceful old
headquarters building, fears of war and recession seem far away - except
inside the second-floor office occupied by Alan Greenspan.;    In his private
lair, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is decidedly on a wartime
footing.  
</P>
<P>
With his television set tuned to Cable News Network, a phone line open to
the White House and an aide poised by his elbow to provide the latest economic
statistics, Greenspan is playing the role of wartime Washington policy-maker
to the hilt.;    Indeed, unlike his predecessor, the prickly and standoffish
Paul A. Volcker, Greenspan has developed close ties to the White House and has
quietly become a key economic adviser to President Bush.;    Greenspan's
influence over White House economic policy became clear during President
Bush's State of the Union address, when Bush announced that he was tapping
Greenspan to lead a new commission to study a controversial proposal to cut
the tax rate for capital gains.;    The appointment will plunge Greenspan -
himself a strong supporter of a cut in capital gains tax rates - directly
into the middle of a raging political debate between the president and
Congress over tax policy.;    By any standard, Fed-watchers say Greenspan is
taking on a role that is almost unprecedented in modern times. Most say they
cannot recall any time the Fed chief has been asked to step so directly into
the middle of such a political controversy.;    "Whenever there are major
economic decisions to be made, (Greenspan) is in on them," a delighted Fed
official said. "His voice is listened to.";    But even before his new capital
gains study begins, it is clear Greenspan has chosen to side with the
administration in the battle over fiscal policy. Soon after the war began, the
Fed chairman signaled he planned to cut interest rates further in order to
ease the credit crunch that seems to be prolonging the economic slump.;    On
Feb. 1, he moved decisively, chopping the Fed's key discount rate to 6 percent
from 6.5 percent. It was the second time in six weeks Greenspan had turned to
this key anti-recession weapon, the heaviest in the Fed's arsenal.;    While
such actions may be justified on economic grounds, they also conveniently jibe
with what the administration wants from the Fed. Secretary of the Treasury
Nicholas Brady, who frequently criticized Greenspan last year for not moving
quickly enough, has been noticeably silent on Fed policy.;    Greenspan's
responsiveness on interest rates, his apparent eagerness to join the
administration's fight on capital gains - and Bush's decision to place the
capital gains issue in his hands - show just how close Greenspan's relations
with the White House have become.;    It also may signal that Greenspan, who
will turn 65 in March, is almost certain to be reappointed as chairman when
his current term expires next summer.;    Indeed, Fed-watchers say the only
parallel in history to Greenspan's close relations with the White House came
in the days of another wartime central banker, Mariner S. Eccles, the Fed
chairman who stood beside President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War
II.;    "I think Bush is turning more and more to him for economic advice,"
says Lawrence Kudlow, an economist and senior managing director at Bear
Stearns in New York. "There seems to be a real interesting power shift going
on, with Greenspan becoming more and more influential.";    It wasn't always
that way. During most of Bush's first two years in office, the administration
and the Fed chairman were virtually in a state of war.;    Brady and White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu criticized him repeatedly for refusing to
push interest rates down - a move Greenspan insisted might send interest
rates even higher by making financial markets fearful that the Fed was
abandoning the inflation fight.;    There were even some hints that Bush had
decided not to reappoint Greenspan to the Fed chairmanship. Some close to the
president reported that he had all but announced that to intimates in
mid-1990.;    Yet now, with the war under way at a time when the recession has
yet to abate, Greenspan finds himself trying to perform an increasingly
difficult balancing act.;    At the same time he is seeking to be a player in
setting White House policy, he must also guide the Fed through an economic
minefield - the booby-traps of war, recession, bank failures, soaring budget
deficits and crashing consumer confidence.;    Clearly, Greenspan, a longtime
Washington insider with good political instincts, hopes to keep economic
policy in sync with the nation's military strategy - hoping to calm both the
financial markets and the public in order to help keep the wartime economy
stable.;    But critics are cautious about charging that Greenspan is
politicizing the Fed in any way.;    "It is hard to know whether he is
accommodating the White House or if this is just the sensible thing to do,"
says Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh
and a longtime Fed-watcher.;    Moreover, even if he wants to please the White
House, Greenspan still can't appear overly eager to loosen the Fed's reins. He
must still appease the hard-liners within the Fed who remain concerned about
inflation.;    As a result, critics have noticed gleefully that Greenspan -
uncharacteristically, Fed-watchers say - has made some seemingly conflicting
statements on the direction of interest rates and monetary policy in recent
weeks.;    "I've noticed a real change in the message from one day to the
next," Meltzer says.;    Still, most analysts believe that, despite the
confusing message, Greenspan is now solidly in favor of easing interest rates
further - a position that clearly has made him more welcome at the White
House.;    Observers note that Greenspan, who ran his own economic consulting
firm before coming to the Fed to replace Volcker in 1987, is ideally suited to
the role of gray eminence - of a senior behind-the-scenes adviser.;    In
fact, he played such a role on a more official basis during the Ford
administration, when he served as the president's chief economic adviser.;   
It was during the Ford administration in the mid-1970s that Greenspan first
came to know Bush, who served in a series of posts under Ford, including
director of the Central Intelligence Agency.;    "That's really his forte,
providing one-on-one advice," says Robert Kavesh, an economics professor at
New York University and a Greenspan friend since they were college classmates
at New York University in the late 1940s.;    "He's a low-key guy who is at
his best in a private situations where he can quietly exchange views. And I
think Bush is someone who is open to that kind of advice."

  WHAT'S BEHIND DELAY IN RENAMING FED BOSS?  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan is expected to be reappointed to
another four-year term any time now.;    But analysts say the timetable for a
reappointment is getting especially tight, considering that the Fed chairman's
term ends Aug. 11, less than a month-and-a-half from now.  
</P>
<P>
"What are they waiting for? Does it mean that something's up?" asks William
Dudley, senior economist at Goldman Sachs 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co.;    Delaying reappointment,
say some analysts, is the Bush administration's way of keeping Greenspan on
tenterhooks and making sure the central bank doesn't assert its independence
too strongly.;    Dudley says the fact that Greenspan hasn't been reappointed
with six weeks left in his term "does raise legitimate questions" about the
Bush administration's intentions.;    Bush and his advisers have often
criticized Greenspan's Fed and have implied that the central bank waited too
long to cut interest rates at the start of the recession last summer. And, in
recent weeks, there have been vague rumors in the financial markets that the
administration may seek to replace Greenspan.;    One name that has popped up
as a prospective candidate is Martin Feldstein, the former chairman of
President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. He is rumored to be
interested in the Fed chairmanship and supposedly has some backing from within
the Bush administration.;    Feldstein didn't return several telephone calls
to his office in Cambridge, Mass., where he is president of the National
Bureau of Economic Research.;    However, David Jones, economist at Aubrey G.
</P>
<P>
Lanston 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co., says the idea of Feldstein as Fed chairman is "a little
far-fetched.";    "There's nobody in the wings, in the way that Greenspan was
in the wings" when former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker was being considered for
reappointment, says Jones.;    Volcker was reappointed June 18, 1983, after
considerable public debate. Then-President Reagan's Treasury secretary, Donald
Regan, opposed Volcker's reappointment, but Volcker's popularity in the
financial community pushed Reagan into giving him four more years.;   
Greenspan also holds the confidence of the financial community.;    "It's hard
to fault his performance, in terms of his pushing for an ease, while
maintaining the credibility of the Fed," says Goldman's Dudley.;    Even so,
the June 18 date Volcker was reappointed was viewed late and that date has
long since passed for Greenspan. Some analysts note, too, that Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Gen. Colin Powell, whose term wasn't up until October, has
already been reappointed.;    "There are reasons to ask questions" about
whether a Fed chairman should be retained, says Carol Stone, senior economist
at Nomura Securities International Inc. "After all, we've had a recession.";  
Indeed, the U.S. economy has been locked in a recession since July 1990.;   
But few economists lay the recession at the Fed's doorstep and, Stone says,
"The level of satisfaction (with Greenspan) is certainly sufficient to keep
him on.";    Jones of Lanston, a firm noted for its Fed connections, says his
"sources inside the Fed say nobody feels anything other than that Greenspan
will be reappointed.";    If reappointed, Greenspan would have to go through
another round of confirmation hearings before the Senate Banking Committee.;  
But a Fed spokesman in Washington says those hearings could be scheduled for
a date after the Aug. 11 end of the chairman's first term, provided the
president said he wanted Greenspan to carry on.;    Technically, that means
Greenspan could be kept in limbo until after his mid-July Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony, where he will give the central bank's economic outlook for the rest
of the year. No date has been set as yet for the semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins
hearing.;    A reappointment delay would sustain the administration's pressure
on the Fed chairman not to say or do anything particularly depressing in
regard to economic growth.;    "By delaying the reappointment, the
administration is able to put considerable political heat on Greenspan," says
Jones. "They can lean on him a little more strongly.";    Certainly, there's
been heat on the Fed in the last few months from the administration and from
private analysts.

<P>
In a surprise move, President Reagan announced yesterday that Paul Volcker had declined a third term as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and that he would nominate Alan Greenspan to replace him as the chief of the nation's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
By picking Mr. Greenspan, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford, Mr. Reagan signed on a man who comes as close as anyone to enjoying Mr. Volcker's credibility in financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old economist is expected to generally pursue policies on inflation, interest rates and economic growth that may appear almost indistinguishable from Mr. Volcker's. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Mr. Greenspan faces a daunting challenge in proving to the financial markets that he is a worthy replacement for the outgoing Fed chief. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market, reacting to the news that Mr. Volcker won't stay on, took its worst pounding in years. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also plunged yesterday against all major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market, however, ended only modestly lower, apparently banking on the notion that the Fed's policies won't change significantly. 
</P>
<P>
The commodity markets, sensing a possible resurgence of inflation, rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"Volcker is sort of a financial demigod, and it's hard for anybody who's new to develop that stature," notes Robert Hormats, a vice president of Goldman, Sachs 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co. 
</P>
<P>
As for Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Hormats adds, "The markets are going to feel him out." 
The new Fed chief also will face political pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans think that Mr. Greenspan may be more accommodating politically during next year's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
A former top Reagan administration official says Mr. Greenspan will probably be "a shade" less likely than the 59-year-old Mr. Volcker to tighten credit and drive up interest rates while the Republicans are trying to retain the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan, who currently heads the New York economic consulting firm of Townsend-Greenspan 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co., will head a diverse seven-member board that has shown it no longer automatically follows the chairman's lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Greenspan is known as a skilled political operator - even more so than Mr. Volcker, who is widely admired for his political acumen. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Mr. Greenspan gained praise for his role in helping forge a compromise to shore up the Social Security system. 
</P>
<P>
He was also one of two men - the other was Henry Kissinger - who negotiated on former President Ford's behalf at the 1980 Republican Convention when Mr. Ford was seeking the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan undoubtedly recognizes that his worst political mistake would be to appear a lackey of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jasinowski, the chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, says Mr. Greenspan may be forced "to out-Volcker Volcker," at least at first, by adopting a tough anti-inflation policy aimed at bolstering the dollar and his own credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Volcker associates, predicting that Mr. Greenspan will try to mold himself in the Volcker image, hailed the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an excellent appointment, and I think there will be very little change in direction as a result of this," says Frederick Schultz, who was the Fed vice chairman from 1979 to 1982 and remains a close friend of Mr. Volcker's. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fed, a senior official says that despite disappointment over Mr. Volcker's pending departure, "I think the reaction is that Greenspan is probably the best choice outside the Federal Reserve System that could have been made." 
Traditional Republican politicians also praise the choice. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole says the "country is very fortunate to have a man of Alan Greenspan's character" to replace Mr. Volcker. 
</P>
<P>
But supply-siders, who oppose high interest rates because they would slow economic growth, are considerably less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
GOP Rep. Jack Kemp of New York says he was "disappointed" that Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson wasn't picked. 
</P>
<P>
And supply-side publicist Jude Wanniski calls the Greenspan appointment "the worst decision to come out of the Ronald Reagan White House," saying that Mr. Greenspan "is one of the ringleaders of the austerity gang." 
And Mr. Greenspan does have a reputation as a stern foe of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ford administration, he strongly supported the Fed's tight-credit policies despite the deep recession those policies helped engender in 1974 and 1975. 
</P>
<P>
He told this newspaper in March 1976: "The cost of being wrong in overstimulating the economy is far greater than the costs of being wrong in understimulating." 
More recently, Mr. Greenspan has been an outspoken backer of Mr. Volcker, often echoing the Fed chief's warnings about the dangers of a precipitous decline in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Mr. Volcker at the White House yesterday, Mr. Greenspan said: "Under Paul's chairmanship, inflation has been effectively subdued. 
</P>
<P>
It will be up to those of us who follow him to be certain that those very hard-won gains are not lost. 
</P>
<P>
Assuring that will be one of my primary goals." 
In a striking endorsement of Mr. Volcker's policies, Mr. Greenspan added: "There are very few people in this profession who are more impressive than he and who seem to do the right thing at the right time almost every time." 
And Mr. Volcker, in turn, lavishly praised his designated successor, saying that he was "very happy" that Mr. Greenspan was going to take over the board. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of a change of leadership at the Fed comes at a delicate time. 
</P>
<P>
The plunge in the dollar earlier this year is forcing the Fed to put a high priority on defending the greenback lest foreign investors pull their funds out of the U.S. and precipitate a financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign funds, the Fed has nudged up interest rates in recent weeks despite continued weakness in the domestic economy. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan has publicly supported some of the remedies that Mr. Volcker favors - especially cutting the federal budget deficit, an action that both men believe would reduce U.S. reliance on foreign funds. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mr. Greenspan was quoted as saying on Feb. 11 that "the long-run solution is almost surely going to mean increasing taxes." 
President Reagan hotly disputes that view. 
</P>
<P>
But although Mr. Volcker and his successor see eye to eye on most issues, some of Mr. Greenspan's recent statements have diverged from the Fed chief's. 
</P>
<P>
On one sensitive matter, for example, Mr. Greenspan was quoted on May 27 as predicting that the dollar "will be significantly lower" in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
That assertion contrasts with the statements of Mr. Volcker, who has avoided saying anything that might depress the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculate that Mr. Greenspan is likely to change his tune on the dollar now that he is headed back to an official capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Asked yesterday at the White House whether the dollar has bottomed out, Mr. Greenspan replied: "There's certainly evidence in that direction." 
He declined to answer further questions about monetary policy, noting that he expects to be quizzed closely at his Senate confirmation hearing. (Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee vowed yesterday to question Mr. Greenspan extensively at his confirmation hearing, but it seems unlikely that the Senate will block his nomination.) 
On monetary policy generally, Mr. Greenspan clearly shares Mr. Volcker's pragmatic approach of tightening and easing credit based on a variety of factors - the money supply, interest rates, foreign-exchange rates and other indicators of growth and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Under Mr. Volcker, this approach came to be known as "the Volcker standard" because its credibility - unlike other approaches, such as the gold standard - depended heavily on the Fed chief's personal stature and judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the question is whether a "Greenspan standard" will prove as successful. 
</P>
<P>
One problem that Mr. Greenspan will face will be to unite the other Fed governors around his policies. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Reagan has appointed several supply-siders to the seven-member board, and they have loosened Mr. Volcker's once-iron grip over Fed policy. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan might be even less able to control the other Reagan appointees and will have to take time to gain their confidence, as Mr. Volcker has done. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan, who speaks with assurance and possesses a dry sense of humor, has excellent relations with the press. 
</P>
<P>
He is a bachelor and has dated several female journalists, including, in past years, Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the aloof Mr. Volcker, Mr. Greenspan enjoys socializing and has been known to relax at parties by playing the piano; he also played tenor sax and clarinet in the Henry Jerome orchestra, sitting next to Leonard Garment, who later became White House counsel and who now is a Washington lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is a follower of Ayn Rand, the late philosopher who fervently advocated freeing capitalism from government constraints, Mr. Greenspan gets along well with politicians of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, for example, Mr. Greenspan was one of the first people consulted by Sen. Edward Kennedy as the Massachusetts Democrat was launching his unsuccessful bid for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts his consulting business has been very successful, although not all his private ventures have gone well. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan was a principal at Greenspan O'Neil Associates, a pension fund management concern founded with $2 million of Hollywood talent-agent Marvin Josephson's money back in September 1984, but the firm folded earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan will be able to draw authority from his popularity in financial markets - which, though clearly not as great as Mr. Volcker's, is considerable. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hoey, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. economist who frequently conducts polls about the Fed, says Mr. Greenspan "has always been No. 1 or No. 2 since 1983" in surveys asking Wall Streeters who could best replace Mr. Volcker. 
</P>
<P>
The one person who sometimes ranked higher in the surveys was E. Gerald Corrigan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and widely considered a Volcker protege, "and the general view was that Corrigan didn't have a serious chance," Mr. Hoey says. 
</P>
<P>
"So Greenspan was No. 1 among those believed to have a reasonable chance." 
But in global monetary affairs, "Greenspan is a totally unknown quantity," says Dimitri Balatsos, a London-based economist with Kidder, Peabody 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co. "Volcker also has a good rapport with his central-bank counterparts around the globe, which Greenspan clearly lacks." 
Treasury Secretary James Baker dismissed the markets' sour reaction to yesterday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that when the market focuses on . . . the outstanding qualifications of the successor to Chairman Volcker that you won't see that kind of activity continue for a sustained period of time," Mr. Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, reaction was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said Mr. Greenspan "would not have been my choice. 
</P>
<P>
One day, we'll have a Federal Reserve chairman whose primary interest is in keeping interest rates low." 
Democratic Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, lamented the loss of Mr. Volcker, saying, "We're going to miss him, miss him very much," and adding that he needs "to take a long, careful look at Alan Greenspan" before deciding whether to support his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, said Mr. Greenspan "is a man of considerable knowledge and experience." 
And Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, said the president had made "a good appointment." 
At the White House yesterday, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that he faces a tough task. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to fill Paul Volcker's shoes," he said, "is going to be an extraordinary challenge."

 The Outlook:
Challenges Ahead
For New Fed Chief

<P>
How strong a Federal Reserve Board chairman will Alan Greenspan be? 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
He has close ties to the traditional wing of the Republican party, especially with top Reagan administration officials, and this raises questions about his independence from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
And he has had run-ins with supply-siders. 
</P>
<P>
This raises doubts about whether he can control the Fed's seven-member board, which includes a majority of members in the supply-side camp. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan's admirers predict confidently that he will overcome these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Eickhoff, an economist who was once second-in-command at Mr. Greenspan's consulting firm, says anyone fretting about his capacity to be his own man "does not know Alan Greenspan." 
Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman says Mr. Greenspan - who chaired a bipartisan commission on Social Security overhaul in 1983 - is "a good consensus builder" who will work well with the board. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Mr. Greenspan's favor is the fact that Congress is inclined to give the Fed wide latitude, thanks to the inflation-fighting success of the retiring chairman, Paul Volcker. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan appears anxious to protect that legacy. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Reserve Board itself that may prove most troublesome for Mr. Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan administration made life difficult for Mr. Volcker by packing the Fed with supply-siders, who see less inflationary threat from robust growth than economists generally, including Mr. Volcker. 
</P>
<P>
At one point the Fed's supply-siders nearly provoked him to resign, outvoting him to cut interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
And recently released minutes of a Fed policy-making meeting show that some of the supply-siders resisted Mr. Volcker's policy of nudging rates higher to defend the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Some Volcker associates say his problems with the board contributed to his decision to leave. 
</P>
<P>
They believe he would have agreed to remain if President Reagan had exhorted him to put aside his personal preferences; this would have increased his clout inside and outside the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
The five board members appointed by Mr. Reagan "are much more individual and in a lot of ways much more unpredictable" than their predecessors, one Volcker associate says. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes the job of chairman more difficult and unattractive. 
</P>
<P>
So against that background, it was all the more important that he get a strong presidential appeal." 
Mr. Greenspan is unlikely to find the situation much easier. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Ture, a friend of Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, the board's most influential supply-sider, observes that Messrs. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan and Johnson "march to quite different drummers" on many economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
Another Johnson friend recalls that when the vice chairman served at the Treasury he "was very, very critical" of positions Mr. Greenspan - then an outside Reagan adviser - took in favor of tax increases and Social Security overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some of the Reagan Fed appointees have privately voiced optimism that Mr. Greenspan's leadership will result in greater harmony because he, unlike Mr. Volcker, shares the Reagan majority's pro-deregulation views on banking issues. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, says one source close to the Reagan board members: "Everyone on the board knows that while the president might not stand behind Volcker, he would have no choice but to stand behind Greenspan," who will be Mr. Reagan's most visible representative at the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan has to keep enough distance from the White House to avoid compromising the Fed's independence. 
</P>
<P>
The administration clearly hopes that under his leadership the Fed will be less likely than it might have been under Mr. Volcker to drive up interest rates during next year's election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But if Wall Street, leery of inflation, should begin to sense Mr. Greenspan caving in to White House pressure, the outcome - as Mr. Greenspan himself surely knows - could be a financial-market debacle not at all helpful to Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mr. Greenspan will almost certainly maintain a much closer relationship than Mr. Volcker did with the president and other senior administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
He enjoys excellent relations with White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker. 
</P>
<P>
He may even seek the sort of ties former Fed chairman Arthur Burns had with the Ford administration back in the mid-1970's, when Mr. Greenspan was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
The crusty Mr. Burns met often with top Ford administration officials and influenced the White House on important issues including fiscal policy. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Mr. Greenspan indicated he's well aware of the dangers of this kind of relationship. 'Burns was in no way compromising the independence of the Fed," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Issues of monetary stimulus never came up; he would not have allowed them to come up, and we would never push him. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons he felt comfortable doing that is that I'm his old buddy; he was my professor at Columbia University, and he knew that the last person to get him to do anything inappropriate would be me. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a model of political coordination," Mr. Greenspan continued. 
</P>
<P>
"Nor was it a model that would suggest that the Federal Reserve under Burns would take indirect instructions from the White House." 
Mr. Greenspan concluded: "You have no choice as a member of the Fed but to defend the institution. 
</P>
<P>
You have to. 
</P>
<P>
That's priority number one."

 Greenspan Cleared
By Senate, 91-2,
As Fed Chairman

<P>
By a vote of 91 to 2, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the nomination of economist Alan Greenspan to become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, a position often referred to as the second most powerful post in the land. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan will succeed Paul Volcker, whose term as chairman expires Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fed spokesman Joseph Coyne said that Mr. Volcker will stay on in the post until Mr. Greenspan is sworn in, probably next week. 
</P>
<P>
A widely respected economist who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford, Mr. Greenspan comes to the new job with considerable knowledge and experience. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting the nomination, however, Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) questioned whether the new chairman will act independently of the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Proxmire also criticized Mr. Greenspan's advocacy of banking deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
The only two senators to vote against Mr. Greenspan were Sen. Kent Conrad (D., N.D.) and Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Sen. Bradley said he is concerned that the new chairman "would move too rapidly toward deregulation" and that he lacks sufficient international experience. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal preference," Sen. Bradley said, "would have been for the administration to prevail upon Chairman Volcker to stay for another term." 
After the vote, Mr. Greenspan said, "I'm obviously gratified and I thank the Senate." 
As chairman of the Fed, Mr. Greenspan will be in a position to influence monetary policy and affect the economy's performance over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
He has developed a reputation as a determined inflation-fighter, and is generally expected to follow monetary policies similar to those of his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan issued a statement after the vote thanking the Senate for its "overwhelming support" for Mr. Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Volcker's departure marks the end of a turbulent era at the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
When he was named chairman in 1979, inflation was running at double-digit rates. 
</P>
<P>
By keeping a tight grip on credit, despite severe economic and political pressures, Mr. Volcker and the Fed were able to bring that rate down to less than 2% last year.

Federal Reserve critics used to complain of "stop and go" monetary policies. 
</P>
<P>
They claimed that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt. 
</P>
<P>
But under Alan Greenspan that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
A supremely cautious man, the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, his caution has become legendary within the government. 
</P>
<P>
He fusses endlessly over economic statistics, dissecting them in dozens of ways, probing for hours in search of potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
After thoroughly digesting reams of information, he often concludes that more data are needed, and when he finally decides to act, his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small. 
</P>
<P>
Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets. 
</P>
<P>
But he refused, claiming that he wanted to see what happened Monday morning before making any public statement. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed's ranks. 
</P>
<P>
A "senior Fed official" spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times, saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed. 
</P>
<P>
The statement angered Chairman Greenspan, but it was greeted with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the mutinous Fed member hasn't gone public, some Fed governors, most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, are known to have disagreed with the chairman's decision to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan, who is mistakenly seen as the source. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing last week, Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that "Chairman Greenspan's" announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a "very important statement." 
Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he wasn't sure whether Mr. Greenspan "made a statement himself, or whether that was a newspaper report." 
The Fed chairman's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market's plunge, when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets. 
</P>
<P>
A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
And, by the end of that week, the key federal funds interest rate, which is largely controlled by the Fed, had settled at 8.75%, barely changed from the level of just under 9% that prevailed the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of growing weakness in the economy, paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control, have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerns aren't expressed in public. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the administration and the Fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds, fearing stories about an administration-Fed split added to the stock market's jitters. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the split is there. 
</P>
<P>
The administration's concerns are understandable. 
</P>
<P>
The economy is showing signs of weakness, particularly among manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Exports, which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years, seem to have stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Factory payrolls and production fell in September, and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch. 
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy, partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation may be stable at the moment, running at about 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Fed eases too soon, Mr. Greenspan fears, prices may begin to accelerate again next year. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if the Fed holds tight, it may be able gradually to reduce inflation, moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the Fed chairman embraced in testimony to Congress last week. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Mr. Greenspan's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well. 
</P>
<P>
His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten through two stock market crashes, and we've gone through an election without any major problems," says David Hale, an economist of Kemper Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to give Greenspan a good rating." 
But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession, perhaps starting early next year. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, Chairman Greenspan could well become an open target. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Congress is toying with legislation to curb the Fed's independence. 
</P>
<P>
If the economy turns down, such proposals could gain strong momentum.

With a recession comes the blame, followed by the
blame-shifters.
</P>
<P>
In Washington now, the shiftiest are passing the scapegoat
to the Federal Reserve, and especially its chairman, Alan
Greenspan. There have even been rumblings he won't be
reappointed for a second four-year term, beginning in August.
Administration officials insist he's still the likeliest
choice, though the deal is never over until the thin man in
the Oval Office sings. The thin man likes Mr. Greenspan more
than is widely known. But the mere hint that he might be
replaced shows how little Washington has learned from 20
years of economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Greenspan is actually President Bush's biggest
economic asset. Yet having pushed Mr. Greenspan out to sea to
steer the U.S. economy with only a single oar - monetary
policy - the kibitzers in Congress and the White House are
now telling him how to row. And if his form isn't perfect,
they jeer and then threaten to get a new oarsman.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the same crowd that raised taxes three
months into a recession is now lecturing the one Washington
official who inspires confidence in financial markets. If Mr.
</P>
<P>
Bush wants to kill what everyone hopes is an incipient
recovery, he could certainly do it by dumping Mr. Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
In a town where integrity breeds enemies, Mr. Greenspan
has shown too much character. He and his Fed allies haven't
laid down and played the usual game of "roll-the-Fed." Last
year's budget deal was supposed to open the money spigots, or
so the White House promised. But unlike the Bush Treasury,
the Greenspan Fed remembers the 1970s, when roll-the-Fed
produced inflationary booms followed by ever-nastier busts.
</P>
<P>
Enough of its members know that the Fed's main task is to
keep prices stable; stimulating economic growth is the job of
fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bush's economic advisers either don't understand this,
or won't admit it lest they accept blame for their own fiscal
abdication. It's so much easier to bash the Fed. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady spent most of April lobbying for
easier money, even if a little more inflation had to go along
with it.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and Germans first turned him down, so he
leaned on the Fed. He even made phone calls to two Fed
governors to urge them to ease, as columnists Evans and Novak
report. The governors agreed, but for their own economic
reasons. Governor Wayne Angell dissented - less for policy
reasons than to warn administration inflationists.
</P>
<P>
Congress is a co-conspirator because it too is in fiscal
gridlock. Larry Lindsey, a White House aide and new nominee
to the Fed board, went for his Senate hearing last week and
allowed that the Fed could have eased more last year. The
inflation monster was still not appeased; every Banking
Committee senator but Florida Republican Connie Mack griped
or ranted for easier money. Mr. Greenspan is well liked on
the Hill, but Congress still wouldn't mind an easy-money
replacement.
</P>
<P>
Even the corporate elite are scapegoat hunting. The
Business Council, composed of men who never object to higher
taxes on working stiffs, is whining about Mr. Greenspan. "The
Fed should ease more and bring interest rates down," says
James Robinson, the American Express chairman. Amex
shareholders can only hope Mr. Robinson knows more about
finance than he does about monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan's main defenders are the financial markets,
and ultimately the American middle class. Lawrence Kudlow,
the Bear Stearns economist, calls Fed performance under Mr.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan "uniformly constructive." Inflation has fallen from
the oil-price spikes in October to an annualized rate of less
than 3%.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's real struggle has been to get long-term interest
rates, the main engine of a recovery, to fall too. That takes
art as well as science. The Fed can tinker with short-term
rates, but long-term rates carry an inflation premium and so
don't always fall in lock-step. They may even rise if
investors think the Fed is being rolled by the White House.
</P>
<P>
The fact that long-term rates rose after the last Fed easing,
on April 30, is one reason the Fed is believed not to have
eased again this week.
</P>
<P>
It's this political factor that argues most for Mr.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's reappointment. Any replacement will be seen as a
victory for the cause of roll-the-Fed. One possible
alternative, New York Federal Reserve Bank President Gerald
Corrigan, is widely seen as Mr. Brady's ally; if he's
nominated, invest in deutschmarks.
</P>
<P>
A second possibility, current Fed governor and former
Treasury aide David Mullins, has shown signs of independence
but not yet enough for the big job. Former Fed vice chairman
Manuel Johnson is popular in the White House, but he is also
seen as highly political. In short, any replacement would
spend months or years winning credibility in financial
markets that Mr. Greenspan has already earned.
</P>
<P>
The markets' political sensitivity is a signal that the
American middle class does not want its wealth robbed again
by a new inflation. If the recession persists longer than the
White House expects, the solution lies in a new fiscal
policy, such as a renewed campaign to cut capital-gains
taxes. (Mr. Greenspan recommends a zero capital-gains rate.)
It won't help Mr. Bush to fire the one economic-policy
official who's learned something from the past 20 years.

   Fed Chief Is Expected to Be Reappointed

WASHINGTON - For three years, top administration
officials have carped about the performance of Alan Greenspan
as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. But in the next two
months, they are likely to pay him the ultimate compliment by
recommending his reappointment to the powerful post.
</P>
<P>
No decision has been made yet on the fate of Mr.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, whose four-year term expires Aug. 11. But
administration officials familiar with early discussions on
the subject say any effort to depose the Fed chairman will
probably fail, for three reasons:
- Mr. Greenspan is well-regarded in financial markets. A
poll of financial decision-makers by Wall Street economist
Richard Hoey finds 76.5% favor his reappointment; that is
nearly as high as the 76.9% that favored Paul Volcker's
reappointment in May 1983. (Ironically, Mr. Greenspan was the
decision-makers' second choice in 1983 with 5.8% support; Mr.
</P>
<P>
Volcker is now the second choice, with 8.8% support.)
- While President Bush's top economic advisers have their
complaints about Mr. Greenspan, they are unaware of a
replacement they all could support. Former Fed Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson is a favorite of Budget Director Richard
Darman, but has a testy relationship with Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady. Mr. Brady is friends with New York Fed
President Gerald Corrigan, but Mr. Corrigan - a Volcker
protege - would probably be vetoed by Mr. Darman or by the
President's top economic adviser, Michael Boskin.
- And despite the criticisms by his aides, President Bush
still considers Mr. Greenspan a friend and adviser. They have
known each other for years, and the president recently issued
a statement praising the "strong leadership" at the Fed. In
addition, Mr. Greenspan has strong support in the Senate,
which must confirm his reappointment.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan's support in financial markets is especially
important. Past administrations have paid close attention to
market sentiment in choosing a Fed chief. A choice that is
poorly regarded by the financial community, they feared,
would cause market turmoil and possibly higher long-term
interest rates, as traders drove up rates out of fear that
the new chairman might fuel inflation. "The Fed chairman is
basically a Wall Street call," says David Jones of Aubrey G.
</P>
<P>
Lanston 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's influence was apparent in 1983, when
President Reagan's Treasury secretary, Donald Regan, mounted
a strident campaign to keep Mr. Volcker from being
reappointed. Most of the president's top advisers agreed with
Mr. Regan; but in the end, the president reappointed Mr.
</P>
<P>
Volcker anyway, to avoid financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan, appointed by Mr. Reagan in August 1987,
hasn't made much of an impression on the general public. A
new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that 24% of
voters support his reappointment and 17% oppose it; but an
overwhelming majority of 59% don't have an opinion one way or
the other. Even in the midst of a recession, it is clear "the
public does not pay close attention to the Federal Reserve,"
say pollsters Robert Teeter and Peter Hart.
</P>
<P>
Among professional economists, opinions are stronger, and
generally positive. James Tobin, Nobel prize-winning
economist at Yale University, criticizes the Fed chairman for
being too cautious in easing credit, but says: "I think Alan
has a lot of respect among academic economists as a good
applied numbers man, who knows the ins and outs of the
forecasting business." And at the Hoover Institution,
economist Milton Friedman, who also won a Nobel prize, says:
"I think on the whole the Fed has done extremely well since
he's taken over. It's hard for me to find a period this long
in which I have as little fault to find with the Fed."
Mr. Greenspan draws high praise from academics for his
talents as a business and government economist rather than
for his academic performance. In fact, his major academic
work is obscure. Unlike most such works, Mr. Greenspan's 1977
doctoral dissertation, a collection of previously written
papers, isn't available. Librarians at New York University,
which awarded the Ph.D., say it is their policy to keep a
copy of every dissertation, but they are unable to locate Mr.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's. University Microfilms in Ann Arbor, Michigan,
which keeps microfilmed copies of all doctoral dissertations,
also says it doesn't have a copy of the paper. Asked about
the dissertation, Fed spokesman Joseph Coyne said: "We do not
have a copy at the board, but the chairman has a copy in
storage in New York."
At times, Mr. Greenspan has come under criticism both from
some of his Fed colleagues and from outsiders for being too
"political," and too willing to succumb to pressure from the
Bush administration. A recent harsh attack came from the
Economist magazine of London, which said the timing of last
month's decision to cut rates - just two days after
Secretary Brady's plea to other industrialized nations for
global rate cuts - was "a textbook example of how not to
conduct monetary policy" because it made the supposedly
independent Fed look like it was doing the Treasury's
bidding.
</P>
<P>
Fed officials, however, say Mr. Greenspan had little
choice in the timing of the rate cut. He favored an earlier
rate cut but was unable to win the support of three of the
five Fed governors - Wayne Angell, John LaWare and Edward
Kelley. On April 30, prodded by weak economic indicators as
well as phone calls from Secretary Brady, Mr. LaWare and Mr.
</P>
<P>
Kelley agreed to support a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Fed officials considered delaying the move so they
wouldn't seem to be succumbing to Mr. Brady's plea. But the
Treasury's quarterly sale of securities was to be announced
the next day. The Fed generally doesn't like to disrupt the
quarterly refunding operation by changing rates, so that
ruled out any action for another two weeks. Fed officials
decided to make their move right away, and take the
criticism.
