Clinton Not Bothered By Showing in Primary

<P>
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton secured a
solid majority to win his sixth straight Democratic nomination. But,
like a boxing champion who slipped by on points, he is being asked
to explain the lack of a knockout punch.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, 43, was the nation's youngest governor when first
elected in 1978 and he has had a stranglehold on the state's
Democratic Party ever since.
</P>
<P>
But in last week's primary, he garnered just 55 percent of the
vote while Tom McRae, an unpolished campaigner who heads a public
policy think tank, earned 39 percent. Four also-rans divided the
rest.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who toyed with the idea of running for the presidency in
1988 and already is talking about 1996, said he saw no cause for
concern in the margin of his primary victory.
``I didn't see how I could get 60 percent, knowing the number of
people who were saying in the surveys that they thought I was a good
governor but were concerned about the tenure issue,'' Clinton said
recently.
</P>
<P>
Tenure was summed up repeatedly by McRae as ``10 years is long
enough.''
Arkansans grow bored with their politicians sooner than voters
elsewhere, Clinton said, in part because politics in the state is so
personal. Pumping hands at shopping malls and crawfish festivals is
considered as important as running the right television ad.
``I'm just trying to tell people that in business they wouldn't
fire a 43-year-old with 10 years of experience who's doing a good
job,'' Clinton said days before the primary.
</P>
<P>
Sheffield Nelson, who upset Rep. Tommy Robinson for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination, already is jumping on the
theme, saying ``Arkansas is ready for a change.''
Clinton, who has focused on improving the state's education
system, counters by calling himself the candidate of change.
``Frankly, if you look at what I proposed, compared with the
others, it represents more change,'' he said. ``Ten years is an
asset, not a liability.''
Clinton lost his first re-election bid in 1980 to Republican
Frank White, but won again in 1982, 1984 and 1986, when the
gubernatorial term was changed to four years. He has all but
promised not to run for the White House in 1992 if re-elected this
year.
</P>
<P>
His showing in this year's primary, largely in line with
pre-election polls, was the first time since his political comeback
in 1982 that Clinton got less than 60 percent of the primary vote.
``I'm sure the governor would like to have made a better showing,
but when you're in office 10 years you have a lot of friends and a
lot of enemies,'' said Bill Paschall, a Little Rock political
consultant. ``I don't think it's a death blow that he made 55
(percent), but it shows him he has to work harder.''
While the biggest complaint against Clinton appears to be that he
has been in office too long, the governor also has been accused of
being more interested in his national ambitions than state concerns.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's recent troubles with the legislature also have been a
sticking point. Twice in 1989 he failed to win legislative approval
for proposals to increase taxes.
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who hopes to paint Clinton as a tax-and-spend Democrat,
said the primary election results show the governor is on the ropes.
``I'd say against an unknown who never held an office, I think
that was low. It probably did make some bells go off in his head,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would have done better if a large number of
traditional Democrats hadn't crossed over to the GOP primary to vote
against Robinson.
``We did poorly in areas where I did not campaign; where my
supporters, in spite of my best interest, believed the polls and
didn't work; and where we did a poor job of telling the people what
I had done that affected their lives; and where people knew there
was an alternative but didn't know much about what the alternative
was,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Betsey Wright, Clinton's former chief of staff, said the
governor's supporters were complacent.
``Bill Clinton is always perceived as being so strong that people
find it difficult to believe in calls for such cohesion and tight
energies,'' she said of the primary.

</HL>

<P>
[Editorial by Kurt Kister: "Clinton's Astonishing Comeback"] 
On 20 January 1993, Bill Clinton swore his oath of 
office. One month afterwards, renowned commentators declared 
the administration to be a premature birth without any marked 
prospects for survival. Already, during the first week, the 
newly installed President had caused a storm with his 
ill-considered attempt to lift the ban against homosexuals in 
the U.S. Army. Then one blow followed after the other: 
Candidates for important offices were rejected; strong words on 
Haiti and Bosnia during the election campaign were not followed 
by the promised deeds; the new team in the White House was 
extremely clumsy. The man, whom almost two-thirds of all 
Americans trusted - even though only 43 percent had voted for 
him - seemed to flounder like a leaking ship. 
</P>
<P>
How times change! Today Bill Clinton is a President who has 
managed to achieve the most important thing within 12 months: 
America feels better again. Hardly any other master in the 
White House after 1945 has caused as many things to move in as 
many fields as Clinton. In this he is similar to - and this 
makes conservatives complain - Ronald Reagan, the great 
changer. And even more: He is popular. After Clinton's 
popularity rates rose and fell like a roller-coaster, they have 
now almost reached the level of 20 January again. About 60 
percent attest that he is doing good work. One-fifth even 
declare Clinton to be the person they admire most - far ahead 
of family members or other authorities. 
</P>
<P>
What are the successes? First of all, there is the economy. 
</P>
<P>
For 1994, a growth rate like the one in 1988 is predicted, 
which is better than for a long time. Prices are stable, the 
people have confidence in their future and spend more money, on 
consumer goods and investments. At Christmas, business 
purchases with credit cards rose by 25 percent - an unambiguous 
sign that the people incur debts, because they are confident 
that they will be able to pay them. Because confidence is 
higher and interest rates are still low, more Americans are 
buying houses and cars. This creates satisfaction and 
stimulates economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that all this is a success Clinton has been 
given for free; the economy would have recovered with or without 
Clinton. The opposite cannot be proved, but it is a fact that 
the economic climate has clearly improved since the narrow vote 
in favor of Clinton's budget and has not deteriorated as the 
Republicans predicted pessimistically. Another important sign 
is that the annual budget deficit will go down. While, in 1992, 
Bush's economists predicted a deficit of about $300 billion for 
1994, now it seems that the deficit will go down to about $200 
billion in 1994. This is due to the recovery of the economy, 
but also to Clinton's thrift measures. Bill Clinton does what 
Reagan and Bush only promised: The deficit really goes down. 
</P>
<P>
The debts and the economy were the most important topics of the 
election campaign. Clinton has not disappointed his voters. 
</P>
<P>
This range of topics also includes the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and the world trade agreement GATT. 
</P>
<P>
With great skill, Clinton brought together a coalition of 
Republicans and Democrats, who pushed the controversial NAFTA 
treaty through Congress. Even though the president had to 
primarily struggle against his own party, he turned out to be a 
politician with leadership power, who enforces principles, if 
necessary also against his friends. Regarding the GATT 
conclusion, the Americans under Clinton and chief negotiator 
Kantor also acted skillfully and, in the end, correctly. A 
pleasant side effect of the NAFTA affair was that the charlatan 
Ross Perot was deflated - above all by Al Gore, the most 
influential vice president of the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
There are still a number of other things, for instance a new 
weapons law, which Bush and Reagan always blocked; a security 
package, which will bring, among other things, 100,000 
additional policemen to the streets of the cities; a law that 
permits young people to work their university loans off through 
some kind of alternative national service. And the Clintons, 
with First Lady Hillary at the head, have started the struggle 
for a general health insurance. If this struggle were to show 
success in 1994, this could become a piece of reform that can be 
compared only with the introduction of compulsory social 
insurance more than 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And what about foreign policy? Everyone knows the traps in 
Somalia, Haiti, North Korea, Bosnia, and Russia. Clinton's men 
sometimes stumbled, also because they were so inexperienced in 
international matters. However, the team is consolidating 
itself. The change in the Pentagon is one sign of that; Strobe 
Talbott's appointment as Warren Christopher's deputy is another. 
</P>
<P>
Europe must get used to the fact that this administration no 
longer claims superiority in all issues, that it defines 
national interest more narrowly and is, therefore, more careful 
with interventions - political and military ones. One must 
never forget: Bill Clinton has been elected because he is 
supposed to reestablish America's trust in itself. This is the 
yardstick by which the President and his voters measure success 
or failure.

FT  28 JAN 92 / Clinton pins campaign hopes on TV confession
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BOSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas was gambling yesterday that an
extraordinary prime-time television confession of 'wrongdoing' in his
marriage has salvaged his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
During a joint TV appearance with his wife, Hillary, Mr Clinton admitted his
marriage had been rocky, but he denied allegations of a 12-year-long affair
with a former Arkansas state employee and part-time cabaret singer.
</P>
<P>
Ms Gennifer Flowers, the employee, last night held a news conference in New
York in which she accused Mr Clinton of lying when he claimed they were just
friends. She said: 'I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years. . . he is
absolutely lying. I'm disappointed, but realistically I never thought he'd
come out and admit it.'
In response to one question, she said the local Republican party in Arkansas
had offered her money six months ago to reveal her affair with Mr Clinton,
but she had refused. She said she had lied to the press to protect him and
that later she sold her story to a supermarket tabloid because he had
angered her.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference Ms Flowers played 10 minutes of tape-recorded
telephone conversation she said was between her and Mr Clinton. Published
excerpts of these tapes have so far proved inconclusive and questions have
surfaced about her credibility.
</P>
<P>
Ms Flowers maintains she met Mr Clinton in 1979 and 1980 at the Excelsior
Hotel in Little Rock. But the hotel did not open until 1982. She also claims
to have reported on Mr Clinton while working with a local TV station, but
Little Rock's KARK-TV said it could find no tapes to support this.
</P>
<P>
Mr Clinton, the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination, was judged
yesterday to have taken a huge gamble by appearing on CBS's programme 'Sixty
Minutes', which generally attracts more than 30m viewers.
</P>
<P>
Although his campaign advisers said the sex scandal rumours were drowning
out the Arkansas governor's message to voters, the risk was his confessions
could draw further media scrutiny just three weeks before the critical New
Hampshire primary election.
</P>
<P>
Mr Clinton, 46, appeared calm and good-humoured throughout the interview. 'I
have acknowledged causing pain in my marriage,' he said. 'I have said things
to you tonight and to the American people from the beginning that no
American politician ever has.' But in response to a question on whether he
had ever committed adultery, Mr Clinton avoided a clear-cut response. 'I'm
not prepared to say tonight that any married couple should ever discuss that
with anyone but themselves.'
He appealed to the US public for fairness and urged the media to respect his
privacy, instead of turning the 1992 campaign into a 'game of gotcha'.
</P>
<P>
Mr Clinton saw his popularity fall sharply last week among likely Democratic
voters in New Hampshire, Reuter reports from Boston.
</P>
<P>
In a poll by the American Research Group, which has conducted daily surveys
in advance of the February 18 primary, support for Mr Clinton fell 14
percentage points in five days last week.
</P>
<P>
The latest polling data put Mr Clinton in second place, with 25 per cent, to
Mr Paul Tsongas, a former Massachusetts senator, who has 27 per cent of
voters' support.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Local lessons from Little Rock: Michael Prowse examines the
successes and failures of Bill Clinton's policies during his 12 years as
Arkansas governor
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the closing stages of the election campaign President George Bush is
trying to win votes by convincing the public that Mr Bill Clinton has made a
hash of governing Arkansas. The state ranks at or near bottom on almost
every social and economic criteria, says Mr Bush. 'He would do for the
United States what he's done to Arkansas. We do not want to be the lowest of
the low.'
Arkansas is still one of the poorest states in the US. It ranks 47th in
terms of income, ahead of only Mississippi, Utah and West Virginia. Per
capita incomes are three-quarters of the national average, roughly the same
ratio as in 1979 when Mr Clinton was first elected governor. But while the
scale of Mr Clinton's achievement in Arkansas is disputed, the implication
that he has done nothing right in 12 years is unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
Mr Clinton's first gubernatorial term was a failure. The youthful governor,
then in his early 30s, charged in 'like a knight on a white horse to set the
world straight' recalls Ms Diane Blair, a campaign official and old friend.
</P>
<P>
'He tried to do too much, too soon and stepped on just about every economic
toe in Arkansas.'
Defeat in 1980 by a Republican was a seminal event in Mr Clinton's life. He
returned to the governor's mansion in 1983 a wiser politician, committed to
consensus, rather than controversy, and convinced that he could make
progress only on one or two fronts at a time.
</P>
<P>
The priorities he chose were economic development and educational reform.
</P>
<P>
The statistics point to significant achievements in both fields. Mr Clinton
has also been innovative in welfare reform, pioneering forms of 'work-fare'
that make benefits conditional on acceptance of jobs or skill training. But
his record since 1983 can be criticised in many other respects. For example,
he has relied too heavily on an unfair tax system, paid too little attention
to the environment, failed to pass civil rights legislation, and done less
than some other states to reform a poorly functioning health-care system.
</P>
<P>
In promoting industrial development Mr Clinton has struck a balance between
free enterprise and government intervention. 'I know Bill well enough to
know he's fully committed to the free market,' says Mr Warren Stephens,
president of Stephens Inc, a financial services group based in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
Mr Stephens is backing Mr Clinton in the presidential race, having always
previously favoured Republicans.
</P>
<P>
But while welcoming competition, Mr Clinton believes government must create
an environment conducive to growth. His 'hands on' approach was tested in
1985 when International Paper threatened to close down its plants in Pine
Bluff and Camden, mill towns in southern Arkansas. 'Clinton went nuts,' says
Mr John Brummett, political editor of the Arkansas Times. After hectic
negotiations, he persuaded the company to expand its operations in Arkansas,
but only after creating an unusually generous investment tax credit worth
seven cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Mr Dave Harrington, the head of Arkansas's Industrial Development
Commission, says the state's goal is to forge a partnership between the
private and public sectors. 'We're in trouble in this country because many
people believe government and business should be separated. Elsewhere there
is a unity of purpose, a complementarity. Mr Clinton has brought a lot of
that to Arkansas.'
The commission has targetted high-tech sectors, such as aerospace, in its
bid to strengthen Arkansas's manufacturing base. Along with development
agencies in other states it also energetically promotes inward investment,
offering both tax incentives and special support services. 'We guarantee to
a company that we will tailor-train its workforce,' says Mr Harrington. 'We
do whatever it takes, including, for example, sending workers to Germany for
training.'
The Arkansas economy has revived during the Clinton years, creating jobs
faster than the nation, especially in the past three years. Manufacturing
employment has grown about 12 per cent since 1980 compared with a 9 per cent
contraction nationally, and accounts for about 20 per cent of employment
against 15 per cent nationally. Some 109 foreign companies, including big
names such as British Aerospace and Dassault, the French aerospace group,
have sizeable investments in the state, three times as many as in 1979.
</P>
<P>
How much of this progress reflects active industrial policies is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Companies have also been attracted by Arkansas's low wages, weak unions and
central location. During the Bush years, the state may have looked
artificially strong because other regions experienced a hangover after the
speculative excesses of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In the longer-term, Arkansas hopes that educational reforms will pay
economic dividends. In the late 1970s Arkansas schools were widely regarded
as among the nation's worst. On some measures they still lag badly: Arkansas
ranks 25th out of 28 states using the American College Test, a popular
college admission exam. This is a few places worse than in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Mr Burton Elliott, Arkansas's director of education, says the lack of
improvement reflects a rise from 38 per cent to 51 per cent in the
proportion of students attending college; many of the weaker pupils tested
today would have been drop-outs a decade ago. But he readily concedes the
benefits of many reforms are yet to be realised. 'School improvement is a
process, not an event; it takes time.'
Mr Clinton's main schools legislation was passed in 1983, following a year
of state-wide consultations led by his wife, Hillary. The measures included
an increase in teachers' salaries, then the lowest in the US; tougher course
requirements (many schools in rural areas had not previously offered
advanced courses in maths, science or languages); a reduction in average
class sizes; and regular testing of pupils to check progress.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Mr Clinton has built on this foundation with a
'second wave' of reforms. He has encouraged more competition within the
public sector by allowing students a free choice of schools and by making
school districts publish 'report cards' measuring their relative
performance. Teachers' salaries have again been increased, rising by 14 per
cent in the past year. .
</P>
<P>
Mr Mahlon Martin, head of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation in Little
Rock, says Mr Clinton's real achievement has been to change attitudes. A
state that previously paid little attention to schooling has been persuaded
that 'the long-term solution to economic problems lies in a commitment to
education'. In a poor region, money speaks louder than words. Mr Clinton has
repeatedly persuaded a sceptical legislature to finance educational reforms
by big increases in sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
He has done so partly by taking on the teachers' unions. The 1 cent sales
tax to finance the 1983 reforms was agreed only after Mr Clinton insisted on
competence tests for teachers. Some 1,400 teachers lost their jobs, causing
a rupture in relations between union leaders and Mr Clinton.
</P>
<P>
While grudgingly acknowledging some achievements, Mr Clinton's critics in
Arkansas find plenty to complain about. 'He has been a tax-and-spend
governor who believes in intervention,' says Mr Charles Venus, a Little Rock
economic consultant with a free market bent.
</P>
<P>
'Within six months or a year' of entering the White House, a President
Clinton would be pressing for a national value-added tax to pay for social
reforms, he warns. The figures, however, hardly suggest that Mr Clinton has
created a Leviathan in Arkansas: the ratio of state and local taxes to
personal incomes is still the fifth-lowest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Ms Meredith Oakley, a political columnist for the conservative Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette, is even more scathing. 'I'd rate him only average as a
chief executive. It's not his vision that I have problems with, it's his
ability to translate it into something worthwhile. Millions of Americans are
going to be disappointed.'
Mr Brummett of the Arkansas Times, while better disposed towards Mr Clinton,
echoes her theme. 'The bottom line is that he could have got a lot more done
if he had pushed harder. He has a tendency to compromise quickly. He is
obsessed with trying to please people.'
Critics cite two instances where Mr Clinton has fallen short. The governor
has repeatedly relied on increases in sales taxes which are 'regressive' -
in the sense that they inevitably absorb a larger proportion of the incomes
of the poor than the rich. The excuse was that this was unavoidable because
a three-quarters majority of the legislature is needed to pass an increase
in income taxes. Mr Brummett and others, however, say Mr Clinton had the
authority to insist on a fairer solution; he could at least have won
exemptions for commodities such as food.
</P>
<P>
The environment is a second example. 'He went for jobs, jobs, jobs when he
could have been truer to his instincts,' says one critic. Mr Clinton has
been widely attacked for standing back while big companies, such as poultry
producers, badly polluted Arkansas's rivers.
</P>
<P>
No governor who has served as long as Mr Clinton can avoid mistakes or
expect to be free of controversy. But what general conclusions for a Clinton
presidency can be drawn from his Arkansas record?
</P>
<P>
His belief in education as a vehicle for economic and social advance is hard
to question. If elected, he would be certain to use the power of the
presidency to promote this cause. Perhaps more surprising, he has just as
solid a record in promoting business; he differs with many conservatives
only in instinctively rejecting a laissez-faire approach. Rightly or
wrongly, he is likely to regard his Arkansas record as evidence that active
industrial policies can indeed 'grow manufacturing jobs'.
</P>
<P>
The biggest doubt lies over his toughness: will he have the determination to
overcome the formidable interest group pressure blocking reform in
Washington? One reason for optimism is Mr Clinton's remarkable ability to
bridge social and economic gaps: it is striking, for example, that he wins
90 per cent of the vote in the poorest regions of Arkansas while also
attracting enthusiastic support from the state's elite business leaders. If
Mr Clinton wins this election, the White House will be occupied by a
pragmatic moderate with a talent for building diverse coalitions. After the
ideological infighting of the past decade this could prove a recipe for
constructive change.

FT  13 JAN 94 / Democrats join come-clean calls: White House fears of an
erosion of credibility
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While President Bill Clinton has been quaffing Pilsner with Czech President
Vaclav Havel in Europe, controversy over his investments in Arkansas in the
1980s has continued to ferment, threatening to damage his credit with the US
public.
</P>
<P>
The controversy is over whether a bankrupt Arkansas savings and loan
organisation used its funds to prop up Mr and Mrs Clinton's investments in
an Ozark mountain property venture known as Whitewater or to pay Mr
Clinton's campaign debts from his 1984 race for the state governorship.
</P>
<P>
Mr and Mrs Clinton made the Dollars 68,900 investment in 1978, in
partnership with Mr James McDougal, owner of Madison Guaranty, an Arkansas
savings and loan entity. The Clintons say they lost all their money.
</P>
<P>
Republican critics want an investigation of whether Mr Clinton as governor
intervened to delay the shutdown of Madison, which failed in 1989 at a cost
to taxpayers of around Dollars 50m. They also want to examine suggestions
that Madison money was improperly channelled to Whitewater and to Mr
Clinton's 1984 campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
Mr McDougal denies that the Clintons benefited in any way from his handling
of Madison, and notes that he was acquitted in 1990 of fraud charges brought
by a Republican-appointed prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Adding to interest in the case, the Clintons' Whitewater files were handled
by Mr Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel who committed suicide
last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the intense Republican pressure, neither the Whitewater controversy
nor allegations last month by two Arkansas state troopers about Mr Clinton's
sex life as governor appear to have damaged his popularity.
</P>
<P>
A Washington Post-ABC poll published yesterday showed that 59 per cent of
those questioned approved of the job Mr Clinton is doing as president, with
36 per cent disapproving - a rather better rating than the same survey's
finding in December, before both sets of allegations boiled over.
</P>
<P>
Another poll published by USA Today and CNN showed Mr Clinton's approval
rating holding steady at 54 per cent, and 72 per cent said Whitewater had
had no effect on their opinion.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, White House advisers fear a steady erosion of Mr Clinton's
credibility, with both polls showing a decline in the number of people
believing in his honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
The White House strategy for dealing with the Whitewater charges, which were
also raised during the 1992 presidential election campaign, had been to
stonewall. As Mr Clinton put it: 'I didn't do anything wrong. I made an
investment and lost money. I then spent more money to document that we'd
lost money. All the federal investigators in the world that have looked into
this, not a single soul has alleged that I've done anything wrong.'
The White House and attorney-general Janet Reno had tried to deflect calls
for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the matter, arguing
that anyone she named would be viewed as no more independent from her than
the career justice department official now in charge of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
But the move became inevitable after nine Democratic senators joined a
chorus of Republicans in urging the president to ask for a special counsel.
</P>
<P>
Mr Clinton said in a television interview in Prague that he had given all
the information he had to the Justice Department, but 'then people said
'Well, that's not enough' . . . So I think we have to evaluate that and see
where we are.'
Besides reccommending that he ask Ms Reno to appoint an independent counsel
some White House officials are understood to be urging Mr Clinton to make
public all the documents he has handed over to the justice department.
</P>
<P>
Because they were the object of a subpoena, the documents are currently
secret.
</P>
<P>
Ms Reno would have to name the counsel herself, since the law passed in the
wake of the Watergate scandal 20 years ago providing for a special counsel
to be named by a judicial panel lapsed last year.
</P>
<P>
Whatever Mr Clinton does, he can scarcely win. Keeping the Whitewater
documents sealed fuels his political enemies and feeds speculation that he
might have something to hide. Publishing them will just create a flurry of
further news reports.
</P>
<P>
But with senior members of his own party, such as Senators Pat Moynihan and
Bill Bradley, urging him to ask for a special counsel, Mr Clinton can no
longer complain that the furore is just partisan politics - an argument that
has carried less weight all along because the Republican attack has been led
by the eminently moderate Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, rather than the
party's more rabid tub-thumpers.

Could Be at Stake if He Seeks the Presidency in '88

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ambition is a little engine that gives Gov. Bill Clinton no rest. 
</P>
<P>
Ambition has propelled this bright, engaging Rhodes Scholar into the dogfights of 15 primary and general-election campaigns (successful and not) in only 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ambition and its consequences, 6 1/2 turbulent years as governor, have made him "the oldest 40-year-old man in America," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He jokes that Arkansans have treated him the way an Ozarks mountaineer treated a three-legged hog - a hog too good, the mountaineer explained, "to eat him all at once." 
Now ambition has goaded this Democrat to the brink of a presidential bid, and a fundamental choice. 
</P>
<P>
Does he want to protect his legacy as governor, including sweeping education reform, or go for national glory? 
</P>
<P>
Under the creaky Arkansas constitution of 1874, it will be very hard to do both. 
</P>
<P>
That constitution transforms an Arkansas governor into a pumpkin the instant he crosses the state line. 
</P>
<P>
His power passes to the lieutenant governor or, in his absence, the Senate president pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences can be startling. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago Gov. Clinton took a trip to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he got back, Senate President Pro Tem Nick Wilson, a Democratic adversary with scores to settle, had made 20 appointments to state boards and, for good measure, demoted Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, Betsy Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton rescued Ms. Wright, but most other Wilson decisions will stick. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Wilson says the governor can easily avoid future embarrassments. 
</P>
<P>
Just stay home. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Clinton grouses that the senator behaved like his seven-year-old daughter, Chelsea Clinton, on a bad day. 
</P>
<P>
But the incident vividly illustrated the risks here at home of a presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard for a governor to run for president," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Carter and Reagan did it, but they weren't sitting governors any more." 
That reality could yet dissuade Mr. Clinton from running. 
</P>
<P>
But sitting in his sun-washed office - an Arkansas-made fiddle on the mantlepiece, portraits of Lincoln and Churchill looking down upon his desk - he leaves little doubt that his heart is already on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
Such a race would be a long shot at best. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a potential opening for a progressive southerner in the long nomination contest. 
</P>
<P>
And with better-known Southern Democrats like Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers and Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn apparently uninterested in running, men like Gov. Clinton and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. are moving to the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton undoubtedly would run as a pragmatist who made government work, a man who prepared citizens for today's era of international competition by investing heavily in education. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas now is among the nation's top 10 states in the ratio of computers to students. 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of its high school students now graduate, the best ratio in the South and better than the national average of 71%. 
</P>
<P>
A mature politician, Mr. Clinton says, is one who can "harness ambition" and learn from his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
And has he succeeded? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope so," he replies after a pause. 
</P>
<P>
"I've certainly tried." 
Arkansas voters have seen to that, tempering and ultimately humbling the brash young man they elevated to governor from attorney general in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Clinton was riding high, at age 32 the nation's youngest governor, his unsuccessful congressional bid of 1974 only a memory. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1980 Arkansans bounced him out of office. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter helped drag him down, first dumping hordes of Cuban refugees on Fort Chaffee, then precipitating the Republican landslide of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But the ultimate factor was Mr. Clinton himself. 
</P>
<P>
"People got the impression he was a hot shot," says Archie Schaffer, a former administrative assistant to Sen. Bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansans have always had "a parenting attitude" toward their precocious governor, ventures chief of staff Betsy Wright; in 1980 they took him to the woodshed. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat, accepted by a tearful Mr. Clinton, taught him something. 
</P>
<P>
Having sailed into office chockablock with ideas gathered at Georgetown, Yale and Oxford, "he thought he had listened enough," recalls his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
"He learned that the listening process never ends." (An attorney and power in her own right, Mrs. Clinton was named by her husband in 1983 to head the Arkansas Education Standards Committee, which oversaw the state reform effort.) 
Voters forgave him in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Clinton regained the governorship after shortening his hair and promising not to "lead without listening." (His wife did her part by campaigning as Hillary Clinton instead of Hillary Rodham.) 
He won smashing reelection victories in 1984 and 1986, when the state went to a four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Now he heads the National Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
Some veteran lawmakers here say the 1980 thrashing left Mr. Clinton a different, more cautious man. 
</P>
<P>
One is state Sen. Wilson, the man who upset the apple cart as acting governor recently. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Wilson, a progressive, says his feud with Gov. Clinton stems from a broken commitment, not philosophical differences. 
</P>
<P>
But he does see a gap between the governor's rhetoric and his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear him speak out of state, you just want to stand up and cheer," says the senator. 
</P>
<P>
"You think he's ready to charge hell with a bucket of water. 
</P>
<P>
Then he gets back home and that woman (chief of staff Wright) gets out her polls, and he's a different person." 
Still, the Clinton record does contain both risk-taking and solid accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Wright, who directed the 1986 Clinton campaign, argues that the governor's popularity with Arkansans would be "the least of his gambles" if he runs for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"How to protect his programs - that's what he's wrestling with." 
The heart of that record is education reform. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton is probably best known as the first governor to force teachers to take competency tests, which embittered the National Education Association. 
</P>
<P>
But he also pushed a grass-roots campaign that persuaded the Legislature to raise the sales tax for the first time in two decades, channeling all proceeds into education; helped raise standards for school districts and pushed for special programs for gifted pupils. 
</P>
<P>
The governor also champions welfare revision. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas now requires recipients to sign a "contract" committing them to upgrade their job skills. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the state has increased its budget for job training. 
</P>
<P>
But Clinton-era programs could be stunted without further tax increases - hard to get in a state that ranks 47th in per-capita income. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Clinton asked the just-completed legislative session for $163 million in new revenue; it gave him only $66 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some say a preoccupation with presidential politics contributed to the setback. 
</P>
<P>
"He really never got deeply involved until the last weeks," says House Speaker Ernest Cunningham, a frequent Clinton ally. 
</P>
<P>
A special session seems likely. 
</P>
<P>
But handling it, a delicate business at best, would be even touchier if the governor continues to eye the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The "hot shot" image of 1980 hasn't disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
It's just latent, and periodically Mr. Clinton comes close to reactivating it. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton knows he's walking a tightrope between national and state constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
The day after his 1986 election, he gave a televised interview to NBC's nationally distributed "Today" show - then tried to limit the Arkansas press to a wordless "photo opportunity." 
Amid cries of outrage, one Arkansas newspaper editorialized that the "real" Bill Clinton had resurfaced with "the same old egotism and arrogance."

HOT SPRINGS, Ark. - He moved into the governor's mansion
at 32, heir to a tradition of progressive Southern governors
and ready to light up Arkansas. It was January 1979 and there
was so much to do: Education needed to be overhauled, the
business climate needed to be improved, the state needed to
be dragged out of its slumberous, defeatist past. Bill
Clinton, the youngest governor in the nation since Harold
Stassen, had such big plans.
</P>
<P>
But two years later Mr. Clinton - educated at Georgetown,
Oxford and Yale, stylish, glib - was out of office.
</P>
<P>
Arkansans chafed at his arrogance. They recoiled at his grand
bargain, a small rise in automobile license plate fees in
exchange for road improvements. They didn't like the idea
that his wife, a lawyer, hadn't taken his name. They flinched
at being regarded as a backwater reclamation project.
</P>
<P>
The morning after the 1980 election his wife calmly sat in
the governor's mansion and called a real-estate agent. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton quietly tended to paperwork. But the loss hurt him
deeply, marked him, changed him. His friends told him to move
to a state where he would be appreciated, but Mr. Clinton
decided to stay and fight and recover. He's now in his fifth
term as governor, about to become the longest-reigning chief
executive in Arkansas history.
</P>
<P>
Cerebral - he once read nearly 300 books in a single year
- and informal - he delights in wearing a rubber witch's
mask at Halloween while Little Rock's grandees stroll through
the governor's mansion - the mature Bill Clinton was shaped
by two events, one he witnessed and one he didn't. The one he
lived through was his own re-election defeat, the shattering
of a dream and, it seemed, of a career. The one he never saw,
some three months before he was born, was the death of his
father, thrown from his car on a wet, isolated stretch of
highway in southeastern Missouri.
</P>
<P>
And so if he sometimes seemed a young man in a hurry,
there was a reason. "By the time I was governor at 32 I had
already lived three years longer than my father," says Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, now 45 years old. "To me, I wasn't a young man."
His earliest recollection, seared into his memory, was of
his mother at a New Orleans station platform, on her knees,
sobbing as he pulled away in a train. She was in nursing
school, and young Bill was there on a visit with his
grandparents, who were raising him in Hope, Ark. All along he
missed having a father. "It's a sad place inside me," he
says.
</P>
<P>
And though his grandmother tacked playing cards on the
window in front of his high chair to teach him to count and
had him reading by the time he was three, it was his mother
- a woman of strength and sadness who has buried three
husbands - who taught him to think.
</P>
<P>
From the start, William Jefferson Blythe IV - he sneaked
off to a chancery judge at 15 to take the name Clinton, his
stepfather's - was an introspective young man; his best
friend once said he didn't want to go over to the Clintons'
house and watch Bill read. The neighborhood kids leaned
against the kitchen cabinets in the house on Scully Street as
his mother presided at discussions that sometimes spilled
over to debates at Cook's ice-cream parlor and, later, the
old Aloha Lounge.
</P>
<P>
They talked about basketball and dating. But this was the
South, in the years just after troops were called out to
integrate the Little Rock schools. Larger issues were part of
their everyday lives: racial problems, the nature of justice.
</P>
<P>
"So early the wheels were turning about what was wrong in the
world," says David Leopoulos, who grew up with him here, and
he carried a concern about racial justice into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton remembers that his grandparents, who owned a
grocery store in the black section of Hope, were
"instinctively opposed to segregation." The Hot Springs
schools were segregated - he graduated from high school in
1964 - but he was part of a small group of white students
who regarded the system as unjust. "Bill was quite explicit
about it: He thought this was totally unfair, wrong," says
Glenda Johnson Cooper, one of his classmates who recalled
that not all his schoolmates agreed. He prided himself for
knowing Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream" speech by
heart.
</P>
<P>
Once a year a photographer came to Hot Springs from
Dallas, and the portraits, slightly yellow now, show a
big-cheeked youngster, somewhat on the pudgy side, with
unruly hair. But there was ferment inside.
</P>
<P>
As a young man, he overachieved at overachieving. Though
he was reared in a community that not only tolerated but
promoted illegal gambling - craps and blackjack games
flourished in Hot Springs in those years, and slot machines
were as common as cigarette machines - Billy Clinton was a
model citizen. He was the band major, won the Elks Youth
Leadership Award, took calculus and honors English, helped a
friend survive physics and went to Boys State and Boys
Nation. When he invited friends over, he would ask them to
bring their newspaper so he could do the crossword puzzle. He
rushes through the puzzles today in ink, not pencil.
</P>
<P>
The competitive streak that his schoolmates noted in the
boy remained with him as a man and, if anything, has been
amplified by being on the ballot 17 times in the past 17
years.
</P>
<P>
Years ago he would delight in announcing to his mother
that he had beaten Jim McDougal in a math test. Last year
when a group of friends impulsively set out for a midday
round of miniature golf, the men came straight from the
office in their business suits. Mr. Clinton changed into a
golf shirt; he didn't want his Putt-Putt score to be affected
by the 100-degree heat. Even his security guard says the
governor plays cards with relentless intensity.
</P>
<P>
For a man so extroverted, Mr. Clinton is remarkably
inner-directed, sometimes examining his own life with a zoom
lens, sometimes with a microscope. His conclusions can be
jarring, even discomfiting.
</P>
<P>
"I had been living with the idea of my father's death, and
therefore my own mortality, since I was a kid," he says, "and
that's maybe why I competed so hard and wanted so much."
Indeed, on his honeymoon he read Ernest Becker's meditations
on death, chock full of critiques on Freud and Kierkegaard.
</P>
<P>
Throughout his life Mr. Clinton has been surrounded by
strong women, first his mother, who at 68 still works as an
office nurse and who follows the horses from her home amid
the wisteria here in Hot Springs, and later his wife, who
finally came to call herself Hillary Clinton and with whom
Mr. Clinton has shared an intellectually rich if sometimes
tempestuous relationship.
</P>
<P>
"We were in wars - campaigns, everything else - from the
beginning," he says, "and if it wasn't easy, it was always
good."
Today Mr. Clinton refuses to answer "have-you-ever?"
questions about his marriage and personal life. Those who
know the couple say that the Clintons have had rocky times -
problems that led political foes and even some admirers to
describe Mr. Clinton as a womanizer. Mr. Clinton acknowledges
that his marriage hasn't been free of difficulties; he
parries and, he hopes, dismisses the charges with a simple
assertion: "Anybody who knows us knows we love each other and
are committed to our child."
Even so, the early days of his presidential campaign have
been so shadowed by talk about marital infidelities that he
has been forced to address the question, even taking the
unusual step of having his wife accompany him to a breakfast
with political reporters in Washington last month. His
advisers are plainly, even openly, worried that this question
will be a distraction to the campaign, perhaps even an open
political wound.
</P>
<P>
Those who know Mr. Clinton well insist the couple have
worked through the difficulties in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons met at Yale Law School, where Mr. Clinton was
known for his boasts that his first hometown, Hope, grew the
largest watermelons in the world, and where Hillary Rodham
was known as a brilliant student. His first impression was
that she looked like "an interesting woman," attractive but a
bit forbidding, and he remembers staring at her for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Finally, she broke the ice.
</P>
<P>
Guido Calabresi, now the dean of the Yale Law School,
remembers Hillary as a scholar, adding that Bill - "highly
idealistic, mildly conservative, with passionate cares" -
was marked for Cabinet meetings, not partners' meetings. "A
lot of kids at Yale wanted to go into politics," says Lovida
Coleman Jr., a Washington lawyer who knew Mr. Clinton in law
school, "but Bill was the only one who didn't posture about
it, the only one to whom it came naturally."
As law school ended, John Doar, counsel for the Nixon
impeachment committee, asked Mr. Clinton to join his staff.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the biggest plums on the tree, but Mr. Clinton,
fatefully, decided not to reach for it. He wanted to return
home and run for office.
</P>
<P>
Hillary took the job instead, and after President Nixon
resigned and Bill had moved south she faced the decision she
had put off for so long. "I was going to have to make this
choice," remembers Mrs. Clinton, who had never even known
anyone from Arkansas. "It was never in the game plan to grow
up and fall in love with someone from Arkansas."
She decided to "take the chance," and moved to
Fayetteville, where Mr. Clinton was teaching at the
University of Arkansas Law School and preparing a valiant but
unsuccessful challenge to GOP Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
They became one of the hottest couples in Fayetteville, two
intellectual powerhouses in a town so small that Hillary once
dialed directory assistance only to be told by the operator
that the person she wanted was away for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton, who had seen some of the world during an
internship with Senate Foreign Relations Chairman J. William
Fulbright of Arkansas and during a Rhodes Scholarship, had
big ideas. "He came back to Arkansas full of idealism and
ambition," says James Blair, the general counsel of Tysons
Foods, who used to talk late into the night with Mr. Clinton
at a local pizza parlor. "He thought Arkansas could be
improved, and that he could do a lot of good."
Mr. Clinton was elected attorney general, battled
corporations and the 25-cent telephone call, and was
catapulted to the governor's office. His Little Rock idyll
was ruined both by what he has come to call "a young man's
mistakes" and the rioting of Cuban refugees at Fort Chaffee,
which occurred during his tenure. "He was young and he was
convinced of what was right and he wanted to get it done
immediately," says Webster Hubbell, a former Arkansas Supreme
Court chief justice who is one of Mr. Clinton's closest
friends.
</P>
<P>
Once back in office two years later, Mr. Clinton developed
the style he would take to the White House if elected:
accommodating, adept at forming consensus, conciliatory -
but chary of confrontation. He's personally approachable, yet
his office can be inaccessible; lobbyists say his personal
bureaucracy is so impenetrable they sometimes resort to
leaving things off at the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton's biggest impact has been in raising education
spending and standards. He put his wife at the head of the
effort and the two of them stumped the state. He fought
entrenched interests, including the Arkansas Education
Association, threatening to veto a sales-tax increase that
provided teacher raises. He staked his career on it; as a
young man he had come back from Georgetown wondering why
people in Arkansas didn't have the same educational
opportunities that his college classmates did. "I saw the
light bulb go off at age 19 to want to fix that," remembers
Carolyn Yeldell Staley, who grew up with him in Hot Springs.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s came another milestone, the birth of
his daughter, Chelsea. "I got a great gift my father never
had," he says now. "I got to see my child."
He takes his parental responsibilities seriously, telling
Burt Reynolds he wouldn't join him at Evening Shade High
School because Chelsea had a dance recital that night. He
says he didn't run for president in 1988 because his daughter
wasn't old enough to handle the separation. She's 11 now, and
Mr. Clinton says she's ready.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton is older, too. He's had some sobering
experiences; his half-brother served a prison term for
selling cocaine. He's more prone to compromise and more
willing to delegate. Critics say he's been too eager to make
peace with the state's leading economic powers and is more
effective at national conferences on child care and welfare
reform than he has been at home, where making major strides
in a poor, tradition-bound state is difficult. But he is also
more relaxed, more patient, than he was when he was younger.
</P>
<P>
"I spent most of my life being a boy wonder," says Bill
Clinton, "and it was much overrated."

 Policy -  Campaign '92:
   Clinton Received a Vietnam Draft Deferment
   For an ROTC Program That He Never Joined

<P>
HOT SPRINGS, Ark. - It was the summer of 1969. The
Vietnam War was raging. And young Bill Clinton didn't want to
be drafted.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton was in a bind because although he was studying
as a Rhodes scholar at England's Oxford University,
graduate-school deferments had been ended in 1967. But he
found an out: He said he would join a reserve-officers
training program at the University of Arkansas while he
attended law school there.
In fact, he never joined the program, or even attended the
law school. But it exempted him from the draft during
September and October of 1969, the critical two months when
he expected to be called into service.
</P>
<P>
By October, he had a change of heart and subjected himself
to possible induction. But by then the draft lottery was
about to take effect and he drew a lottery number high enough
that he never was called.
</P>
<P>
Many young men with Mr. Clinton's educational background
found ways to avoid military service during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
But the issues raised by his conduct remain relevant for
several reasons. The question of whether Vice President Dan
Quayle used influence to get into the Indiana National Guard
in 1969 - and thus avoid Vietnam - stirred a debate in the
last campaign, and Republicans no doubt will demand that Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's record receive equal scrutiny. Moreover, people
directly involved with Mr. Clinton's draft status contradict
his version of what happened.
</P>
<P>
Even back in 1969, Bill Clinton wasn't just any young man.
</P>
<P>
Though he had been classified 1-A - available for military
service - when he graduated from Georgetown University in
the spring of 1968, as a Rhodes scholar he was the pride of
his community. So instead of calling him right away, the
local draft board gave him a reprieve to allow him to
continue his studies at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
"As old as he was, he would have been at the top of the
list" to be drafted, says 84-year-old Opal Ellis, the draft
board's executive secretary. But, she explains, "we were
proud to have a Hot Springs boy with a Rhodes scholarship,"
and so "the board was very lenient with him. . . . We gave
him more than he was entitled to."
Mr. Clinton's own memory is even more precise. He says the
board told him that he wouldn't be drafted until the fall of
1969, a year and a half after being designated 1-A. "The
board said, `You'll probably be called in the fall, September
or October {of 1969},'" he says in an interview.
</P>
<P>
So when Mr. Clinton returned home after his first year at
Oxford, he knew the draft was imminent. Mrs. Ellis, a
Republican who held her civil-service position for 20 years,
alleges that he "went in and told me he was too well educated
to go." She says he told her that "he was going to fix my
wagon {and} pull every string he could think of." But Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton says he doesn't recall having any confrontation with
Mrs. Ellis, and he strongly denies using strongarm tactics to
avoid the draft; anyone who says he did, he says, "has, at
best, a faulty memory." In any case, Mr. Clinton says he
decided to, in his words, "look around" for another option.
</P>
<P>
He opposed the war, but if he had to serve he preferred to be
an officer rather than a draftee, so he sought an officer's
training program to join. He took the Air Force officer's
exam, he says, but failed because of a vision defect. He also
took the naval officer's test, but failed because of a
hearing problem. (He had already taken his draft physical,
and neither problem prevented him from passing.)
Then, as his expected draft deadline loomed, Mr. Clinton
met Col. Eugene Holmes, an Army ROTC recruiter at the
University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. Both men say Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton agreed orally to join the Army officer's program at
the law school there.
</P>
<P>
And based on that consent, the Hot Springs draft board, on
Aug. 7, 1969, reclassified Mr. Clinton from 1-A to 1-D - a
draft deferment that a spokesman for the Selective Service
System says was only for people who had joined a reserve
unit, or who were students taking military training, such as
the ROTC.
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Clinton never joined the training program - and
for that matter, never even enrolled at the university. He
had one more year to go at Oxford, and intended to complete
that work. And when he finally returned to the U.S. in 1970,
he enrolled not at Arkansas, but at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton says he indeed planned to attend Arkansas,
after he completed his studies in England. He says the
university informally accepted him based on his academic
record, though he never formally applied there. A Clinton
aide says the governor believes that he applied to Yale
during his second year at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
But even Virginia Kelley, Mr. Clinton's mother, says she
doesn't remember him planning to attend Arkansas. "That's
very strange," she says. "I was under the impression when he
came home from Oxford that he was going to go to Yale."
Mr. Holmes, who counts himself as a political independent,
says Mr. Clinton's true plans weren't ever made plain to him;
he thought Mr. Clinton's arrival was imminent. "I thought he
was going to finish a month or two in England and then come
back to the University of Arkansas," he says, adding of the
1-D deferment: "I couldn't have done it for a year. That
wouldn't have been ethical." He charges that "Bill Clinton
was able to manipulate things so that he didn't have to go
in."
Mr. Clinton disputes Mr. Holmes's version of what
happened. He says Mr. Holmes offered him the ROTC deferment
immediately and also encouraged him to return for his final
year at Oxford. "I remember talking to Holmes one day, and he
said: `You know, you can't go to summer camp until next
summer anyway. Why don't you just go back and do your second
year in England?'" Mr. Clinton recalls.
</P>
<P>
In any event, Mr. Clinton had his deferment in time to
cover the very period - September and October of 1969 -
that the draft board had earlier told him was when he would
probably be conscripted.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the deferment was proper, Mr. Clinton says:
"I didn't know what the rules were. All I can tell you is
what they told me." But he says he soon had doubts about the
morality of it. "I had already had one year, I had high
school classmates who were already dead," he says. "I decided
it was an inappropriate thing to do."
So Mr. Clinton informed Col. Holmes that he wouldn't be
joining the ROTC after all. Mr. Clinton recalls that he
notified Col. Holmes that he wouldn't participate in ROTC in
"September or early October." Col. Holmes has trouble
remembering, though he thinks it might have been "a month or
two months" from the time of their August conversation.
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Holmes says he was angered to learn of the change
of plans, and moved to revoke Mr. Clinton's draft deferment.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 30, 1969, Mr. Clinton was reclassified 1-A.
</P>
<P>
"Ethically I think he should have stayed in ROTC," Mr. Holmes
says. "He'd given his word and was backing out."
Having averted the fall draft, Mr. Clinton says he was
fully prepared to be conscripted. But he was never called. A
new draft lottery system, based on dates of birth, was
enacted into law on Nov. 26. And on Dec. 1, 1969, Mr. Clinton
got number 311. No one with a number higher than 195 was
called, according to the Selective Service System.

<P>
WASHINGTON - Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's detailed
explanation of how he avoided the draft during the Vietnam
War still contains some gaps and unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
There have been gradations and variations in the
Democratic presidential contender's story since last week,
when The Wall Street Journal published an article on how he
escaped the draft during two key months in the fall of 1969.
It is now clear that the 23-year-old Mr. Clinton, like
many of his peers at that time, worked to obtain a draft
deferment during the summer of that year, when he felt
certain he was about to be called up for military service.
</P>
<P>
Gov. Clinton has said he later dropped that deferment
because he felt it was morally wrong to keep it while his
friends died in combat. But in a letter he wrote at the time,
he said he dropped the deferment to maintain his "political
viability." And it appears that he didn't actually subject
himself to the draft until it became clear that he had a
reasonable chance of escaping induction altogether.
</P>
<P>
Here's a closer look at the questions that are raised by
his statements:
Did Gov. Clinton ever intend to enroll in the Reserve
Officer Training Corps program at the University of Arkansas,
as he agreed to do at the time he received his deferment?
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton never enrolled in either the ROTC or the
University of Arkansas, making dubious the circumstances
under which he received the deferment at such a critical
time. What's more, in a letter to his ROTC recruiter, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton admitted, "I had no interest in the ROTC program
itself" and concedes that he may have "deceived" the
recruiter about his attitude.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton has said on several occasions recently that
for a brief period in the summer of 1969, he did intend to
join the ROTC and the University of Arkansas, but only after
finishing the second year of his Rhodes scholarship at Oxford
University in England. Col. Eugene Holmes, director of the
ROTC program at the University of Arkansas, says it would
have been improper for him to grant a deferment for Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton if he had no intention of joining the ROTC program
until a year later.
</P>
<P>
When Mr. Clinton backed out of his agreement to join the
ROTC, was his intention to subject himself to the draft?
</P>
<P>
That's what he has said in his statements and in his
letter. But Mr. Clinton didn't back out of the agreement
until after a statement on Sept. 19, 1969, by President Nixon
that made it clear that few new conscripts would be called
until December, when a draft lottery system was to begin. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said he was unaware of any plans for a lottery
system at the time he backed out of his ROTC agreement, but
the president's comments were widely publicized.
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Mr. Clinton's ROTC deferment, which lasted
2 1/2 months, enabled him to escape almost certain induction
and instead put him into a lottery system where his chances
of being called were smaller.
</P>
<P>
Why did Mr. Clinton wait until Dec. 3, 1969, to write to
Col. Holmes about his harsh views of the draft, the war and
the ROTC?
</P>
<P>
The letter provides no answer to that question. But it was
written two days after the lottery numbers were announced.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton drew an extremely high number, 311, making it
clear that his chances of ever being called into service were
very small. After that, he may have felt freer to confess his
feelings.

When allegations of draft dodging threatened to blow up
Bill Clinton's campaign, a crew of former Rhodes scholars
became his Patriot missile.
</P>
<P>
The group included Harvard economist Robert Reich, Time
magazine editor at large Strobe Talbott and Richard Stearns,
a Massachusetts state judge - all friends of Mr. Clinton
since their days together at Oxford University. Each talked
to reporters about Mr. Clinton's passionate opposition to the
Vietnam War and his anguish over his draft status. Another
friend from his Oxford days, Michael Mandelbaum, a national
security expert from Johns Hopkins University, wrote a New
York Times opinion piece staunchly defending Mr. Clinton's
actions.
In Georgia, where the draft issue and allegations of
womanizing threatened to derail the candidacy, it was Gov.
</P>
<P>
Zell Miller and Sen. Sam Nunn, two friends of Mr. Clinton
from the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, who came to
the rescue. Sen. Nunn, the chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, lent his credibility on defense matters, while Mr.
</P>
<P>
Miller launched stinging rhetorical attacks on Mr. Clinton's
rivals for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Nobody collects friends like Bill Clinton - and nobody
puts them to better use. Inside the Clinton campaign, they
are known as the FOBs - Friends of Bill's - and they make
up a remarkable network. Its members include a virtual who's
who of the 40-something Democratic establishment, with large
contingents from Georgetown and Oxford universities, Yale Law
School, the 1972 McGovern campaign, the Democratic Leadership
Council and an elite policy organization known as the
Renaissance Group.
</P>
<P>
His extraordinary network of loyalists left Mr. Clinton in
position to mount his sweeping victory in this week's Super
Tuesday primaries. Now, the FOBs are focusing on next week's
critical tests in Illinois, where Mr. Clinton's law school
moot court opponent is helping organize the state, and
Michigan, where a former roommate is doing likewise.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton portrays himself as a Washington outsider. "I
am not the favorite candidate of the Beltway," he said after
his loss in this month's Maryland primary to Paul Tsongas,
whom he criticizes for his work as a Washington lobbyist. Yet
a host of Washington lobbyists have been Mr. Clinton's
"benefactors" - individuals committed to raising at least
$10,000 for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The notion that he'll be an outsider unschooled in the
ways of Washington is really a misperception," says Stuart
Eizenstat, a Washington lawyer, former Carter administration
official and friend and adviser to Mr. Clinton. "This is a
guy who is very much plugged in."
Unlike Mr. Eizenstat's former boss, Jimmy Carter, Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would arrive in the White House with longstanding
ties to official Washington and with an array of friends from
the Democratic Party's policy elite, the business world and
the legal community. He would be the most
Establishment-rooted Democratic president since John F.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, a surprising feat for the governor of a small,
relatively poor state.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton's friends say they are drawn to him by his
intelligence and charm. In addition, after more than a decade
of graying GOP leadership, many evidently are lusting for a
return to power, and see him as their best hope.
</P>
<P>
But another reason Mr. Clinton has been able to attract
and keep so many friends is simply that he works at it. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is calculating and ambitious, having set his sights
on the presidency during his teen-age years. Throughout his
life, he has stayed in touch with people through letters and
notes. He has also sought to involve his friends at decisive
moments in his career. In 1987, for instance, he summoned a
number of them from his Oxford and McGovern days (he ran the
1972 nominee's Texas campaign) to help him decide whether to
mount a presidential campaign in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that he would one day be running for president
occurred to all of us," says William Coleman III, a Detroit
lawyer who was Mr. Clinton's roommate at Yale Law School. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Coleman, son of former Transportation Secretary William
Coleman, is helping organize blacks for Mr. Clinton in next
week's Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
Because he had cultivated so many friends who went on to
high places, Mr. Clinton began his presidential effort with a
built-in issues-and-money machine. Friends inside Arkansas,
such as Thomas (Mack) McLarty, chairman of Arkla Inc., the
gas utility, raised millions early in the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
Mr. McLarty attended Miss Mary's kindergarten with Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton in Hope, Ark.
</P>
<P>
After a supermarket tabloid reported allegations that Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had a long extramarital affair, Harry Thomason,
another Arkansas native who now lives in Hollywood and
produces the hit CBS television program "Designing Women,"
flew to his old friend's side in New Hampshire. Mr. Thomason
helped Mr. Clinton's media advisers put together two live TV
programs to answer the charges.
</P>
<P>
In Baton Rouge, attorney Alston Johnson has been shaking
the money trees in Louisiana for his old friend. He
nostalgically recalls the summer of 1963, when he and Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met at an American Legion Boys Nation conference in
Washington and got to shake President Kennedy's hand. Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton uses a photograph of that occasion in his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
All four of Mr. Clinton's roommates from Georgetown
campaigned for him in New Hampshire. On Wall Street, another
friend from Georgetown days, Roger Altman, an investment
banker with the Blackstone Group, has personally raised
$75,000 for the candidate. Mr. Altman says Mr. Clinton's
political skills were already so well honed at Georgetown
that his successful campaign to become leader of the student
government "was like watching a hot knife go through butter."
At Oxford, other future contacts were cemented. Besides
fielding draft queries for his friend, Mr. Reich is at the
center of the Clinton campaign brain-trust, pumping out
issues papers and speeches from his office at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government. "Bill and I have
been talking about these issues for 25 years," Mr. Reich
says. "The poor man has been encumbered with all my books and
articles, and there is even evidence that he has read them."
Mr. Talbott of Time magazine says it "required some
reflection" before he spoke out in the press about how many
Rhodes scholars, including Mr. Clinton, felt about the war in
Vietnam. "In general, people in our line of work don't become
part of the story," he says. But he says he felt compelled to
step forward when he saw his friend being attacked as a
draft-dodger. "I saw that as an inaccuracy," he says. "Since
I was part of that cohort and knew the frame of mind, I felt
that I should speak out." Mr. Talbott, who appears regularly
on the public-affairs television program "Inside Washington,"
discloses his friendship with Mr. Clinton when he discusses
politics.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Eakeley, another former Rhodes scholar and friend
from Oxford days, says he put together a successful
fund-raiser for the campaign in New Jersey last December
simply by calling on a list of Mr. Clinton's old pals from
Georgetown, Yale Law and Oxford. "To have someone from
Arkansas running for president and trying to raise money in
New Jersey should have been unheard of," Mr. Eakeley says.
</P>
<P>
"But we raised $100,000 largely because of this extraordinary
network."
At Yale Law School, Mr. Clinton met his wife, Hillary, who
has her own formidable network of friends. Mrs. Clinton has
brought an array of high-powered attorneys into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
They include New York lawyer Susan Thomases, a politically
adept former aide to New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who has
traveled with Mrs. Clinton and helped deflect questions
raised about the couple's investments with a former
savings-and-loan operator.
</P>
<P>
It was also Mrs. Clinton who brought Los Angeles lawyer
Mickey Kantor into her husband's inner circle of advisers;
Mr. Kantor had served with her on the board of the Legal
Services Corp.
</P>
<P>
From their days organizing Texas for the McGovern
campaign, Bill and Hillary Clinton have a small army of
followers. Mr. Clinton won Texas so decisively partly because
Garry Mauro, the popular state land commissioner, had spent
months organizing the state. Mr. Mauro met the Clintons in
the McGovern campaign, as did Carl Wagner, a prominent
Democratic Party operative whose political counsel Mr.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has sought over the years. Harold Ickes, the New York
lawyer who helped manage Jesse Jackson's 1988 campaign and is
working the state for Mr. Clinton this year, met him in
Project Pursestrings, an anti-Vietnam War effort launched
after the 1972 election.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, when Mr. Clinton became his state's youngest
governor at the age of 32, he invited many of his old friends
to his inauguration and even appointed some of them to state
jobs. During the Carter administration, Mr. Clinton made sure
he was known inside the White House, dropping in on Mr.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat and others. Later, during the Reagan years, he used
the National Governors Association as a vehicle to forge
alliances with other elected Democrats. An array of former
governors, including James Blanchard of Michigan and Richard
Riley of South Carolina, have put their old organizations to
work for Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clinton's chairmanship of the Democratic Leadership
Council gave him access to a host of conservative and
moderate Democratic bigwigs, from Sen. Nunn, whose early
endorsement helped give his candidacy credibility, to Buddy
MacKay, who is now Florida's lieutenant governor. The DLC
connection also gave Mr. Clinton an issues factory: Its
affiliated think-tank, the Progressive Policy Institute,
helped churn out most of the candidate's major speeches last
fall.
</P>
<P>
The least-known of the Clintons' networks may be the one
that runs through the Renaissance Group. Founded by a South
Carolina businessman and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate
in the early 1980s, it is a nonpartisan, policy-oriented
group that spends New Year's Eve weekend attending issues
seminars and playing golf in Hilton Head, S.C.
</P>
<P>
Originally, it included mostly Sunbelt politicians who
shared an aversion to going out on New Year's Eve. "The
original idea was to spend the time to think about the year
just passed and the year ahead," says David Ifshin, a
well-known pro-Israel Democrat who serves as Mr. Clinton's
general counsel.
</P>
<P>
The group grew rapidly and includes such disparate members
as Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, liberal New York
attorney and Kennedy insider Theodore Sorensen and David
Gergen, another journalist with whom Mr. Clinton is on
friendly terms. At least a half-dozen high-powered lawyers
working for Mr. Clinton in Washington, D.C., including Mr.
</P>
<P>
Ifshin, met him through Renaissance. "Bill and Hillary have
been at the center of it," says Mr. Ifshin.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sorensen draws parallels between President Kennedy and
Mr. Clinton. "Kennedy blazed the trail for Clinton," he says.
</P>
<P>
"They both used their youth to fit in with a message of
change. They both included a diversified group of friends in
their campaigns." The Kennedy campaign included Choate School
roommates, old Navy buddies and Harvard brain-trusters. But
Mr. Kennedy was born into privilege, while Mr. Clinton, born
of modest means, has built his network from scratch.
</P>
<P>
Lately, there has been some tension between the various
concentric circles of FOBs. Some of Mr. Clinton's advisers
from the McGovern and early days have tried to push the
campaign in a more traditionally progressive direction, while
his advisers within the Democratic Leadership Council would
like him to sharpen his attack on liberal orthodoxy. Will
Marshall, president of the DLC-affiliated Progressive Policy
Institute, worries that with so many campaign cooks and so
many competing agendas, Mr. Clinton's message has lost some
of its "resolution" of late. But if anyone can keep the
disparate network together, he says, it is the man at the
center of it.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton is good at getting the best from a wide spectrum
of people," Mr. Marshall says.
