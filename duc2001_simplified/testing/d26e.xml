Botswana President Relates Global Warning to African Hunger
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Quett Masire of Botswana said
Thursday that industrial nations can help relieve drought and hunger
in Africa by reducing global warming caused by the greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
Masire and Dr. Bernard Ledea Ouedraogo, an anti-hunger organizer
in Burkina Faso, were honored as co-winners of the 1988 Africa Prize
for Leadership for their efforts in averting hunger.
</P>
<P>
A severe drought gripped much of Africa from 1981 to 1987,
killing millions. Experts believe that due to the organizing efforts
of Masire's government, not one person died of drought-induced
famine in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Through early planning, Botswana organized a nutritional
surveillance and warning system and distributed food nationwide.
</P>
<P>
By the time the drought ended, malnutrition had actually
declined. Before the drought, 25 percent of Botswana's children were
underweight. By 1987, that fell to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech, Masire thanked Western donor
governments and private agencies for their help during the drought,
but suggested drought and hunger will get worse in Africa if the
Earth's climate keeps warming.
``The semi-arid tropics will have even greater climatic
variability as the warming continues,'' he said.
``The industrialized countries may do more for Africa in the long
run by helping to reduce global warming than by supplying short-term
aid, however welcome that is at the time.
``We would prefer to prevent droughts altogether rather than have
to learn to deal with them well.''
The warming of the Earth and its lower atmosphere is caused by
trapped solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
The other Africa Prize-winner, Ouedraogo, has organized about
500,000 peasants in nine countries in Africa to develop their
villages based on traditional cooperative village leadership.
</P>
<P>
The villagers in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo raise vegetables, learn new
farming techniques, improve literacy, fight erosion, replant
forests, build roads and improve health care.
</P>
<P>
The Africa Prize consists of $100,000 and a statue, awarded by
the New York-based Hunger Project.
</P>
<P>
Ouedraogo said he will ask the peasant farmers he has organized
how they would like to use his share of the prize.
</P>
<P>
Masire also said he would distribute his share of the award to
grass-roots organizers and villagers who made Botswana's victory
over famine possible.

   Widespread Need for Emergency Food Aid Reported

BFN 
Lilongwe June 6 SAPA - Three million people will 
need emergency food aid in 1994/95 following widespread crop 
failure in central and southern Malawi, the United Nations Food 
Aid Organisation [FAO] said on Monday [6 June]. A recent 
FAO/World Food Programme crop assessment mission blamed the crop 
failure on erratic and insufficient rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
This year's cereal production among smallholders is 
estimated 
to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest, and only 
28 per cent higher than in 1991/92, when drought devasted 
southern Africa. The mission estimated about 493,000 tons of 
cereals would have to be imported. 
</P>
<P>
Of the cereal food aid requirement, about 175,000 tons would 
be needed as emergency assistance for some three million people. 
</P>
<P>
Another 270,000 tons would be required to be sold in the market 
to stabilise food supply and prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Food scarcity in the markets leads to riots, hoarding and 
skyrocketing prices. That happened during the big drought of 
1992. We attach equal importance to keeping the commercial 
sector well-supplied," said WFP Director Phillip Ostenso. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a bumper harvest last year, Malawi has not recovered 
from the massive 1991/92 drought. The sharp decline in the 
production of major crops such as tobacco and cotton due to 
drought means reduced incomes for many rural households. 
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition rates have always been very high in Malawi, 
even 
with good harvests. Studies suggest more than half of rural 
pre-school children suffer from chronic malnutrition. Thus food 
shortages and high prices can quickly aggravate an already 
critical situation. 
</P>
<P>
Although landlocked, Malawi proved in the 1991/92 drought it 
was adequately equipped to handle the transportation, storage 
and internal distribution of large volumes of food imported 
through South Africa, Mozambican or, possibly, Tanzanian ports 
[words indistinct].

FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Van Niekerk's Cape crusade to
rescue farmers - The South African agriculture minister is trying everything
to minimise bankruptcies / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAST FRIDAY was the day of the annual agricultural show at Prieska in the
northern part of South Africa's Cape Province. A few score farmers and their
families from a radius of a about 100 km (62 miles) had gathered to wander
around about a dozen trade and craft stands, have a braai (barbecue) lunch
and to see which of them would be awarded the prize for the best Fat-Tailed
Persian sheep. The temperature was in the mid-40s centigrade (about 120 deg
F).
</P>
<P>
This is virtually desert country where a farmer needs several thousand
hectares and a drought- and heat-resistant breed of sheep to make a
reasonable living. It lies between the Great Karoo in the south and the
Kalahari in the north and the town owes its existence and past wealth to the
mining of blue asbestos and copper from the nearby hills.
</P>
<P>
Now the copper mine is worked out and the lung disease asbestosis has killed
the demand for the asbestos the area once produced. Today Prieska relies
almost entirely on agriculture and in both prosperity and population it is
only half the town it once was.
</P>
<P>
But the mood at the show was jovial and relaxed. The quality of the sheep
entered for the competition was excellent, the food was good and the local
MP was among the small crowd. They know him well; for not only is he a
neighbouring farmer (his farm is just 170 km away by dirt road and that
qualifies as 'neighbour' in this vast hot countryside) but he is also South
Africa's minister of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Mr Kraai van Niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in
any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on
continued political reform in South Africa, and Prieska is the centre of his
constituency. He had delivered a speech at another town that morning; now he
was pressing the flesh of his fellow farmers before addressing a house
meeting in the late afternoon and another in the local town hall in the
evening. In the sweltering heat it was a punishing schedule.
</P>
<P>
If the voters reject continued reform Mr van Niekerk, along with the rest of
the cabinet, will begin preparations to resign. But if the majority of South
Africa's white electorate votes against calls by the Conservative Party and
the AWB for a return to old ways, the minister will be able to return to
other pressing problems in his department.
</P>
<P>
Chief among these is the extended drought which has affected a significant
proportion of the Republic. Indeed, I had expected that the arid area in
which the minister's own farm is situated would be suffering most. But I was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
When I went with him to his 13,000-hectare holding, which has an annual
rainfall of just 6 inches and where temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s
centigrade are normal throughout the long summer, he explained that the
secret of success on such dry bush veldt was to restrict stocking rates (he
runs only one Merino wool sheep per 10 hectares) and to conserve what little
moisture was available.
</P>
<P>
This meant moving each 300-head flock on a regular basis from one
100-hectare camp (pasture) to another so as not to destroy the indigenous
grasses and bushes sprouting from the sandy, rocky terrain and which,
incredibly to my unaccustomed eye, sustained the animals in good condition.
</P>
<P>
He talked with enthusiasm and detailed knowledge about the balance of
nature. And he claimed that it was not farmers like him, who were used to
managing in dry weather, who were in financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
It is, in fact, the arable farmers further east who are suffering most, as I
had seen and heard for myself a few days earlier, and Mr van Niekerk has
already set up committees of bankers, extension officers and local farmers'
representatives, to try to find ways to avoid many of them going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Aid schemes are being worked out, wherever possible, to write off some debt
and to re-schedule the rest, often at subsidised interest rates. But in many
cases the financial position is such that the farmer is beyond help.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the rescue attempts allege that most of the farmers who are in
trouble are financially illiterate and that they are reaping the results of
unbridled expenditure and expansion in the boom years of the 1970s and
1980s. Mr van Niekerk concedes that such suggestions contain an element of
truth But the drought is also an established fact and there are
socio-economic as well as agricultural reasons why as many farmers as
possible should be saved.
</P>
<P>
To allow vast numbers of farms to go out of business at a time when there is
little enthusiasm, even among successful farmers for expansion, would put
tens of thousands of black farm labourers out of work. Since the repeal of
the Group Areas Act two years ago there has already been enormous growth in
the squatter camps around big towns. Hordes of unemployed farm workers would
add to an already serious problem.
</P>
<P>
There is also the immediate problem of ensuring the availability of
sufficient food. South Africa consumes between 6m and 7m tonnes of maize
each year. Production from this year's drought stricken crops is forecast at
less than 3m tonnes. In addition, the republic has long term commitments to
supply maize to other southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
It appears likely, therefore, that it will be necessary for South Africa to
import up to 5m tonnes of maize during the coming months. Some commentators
have suggested that the port facilities are inadequate to handle such
volumes within the time available but Mr van Niekerk assured me that his
department had done the calculations and confirmed that they can and that
imports have already begun to arrive. He also denied that there was any
possibility of rationing over coming months.
</P>
<P>
Some of his optimism was based, however, on the possibility that South
African-grown wheat could be substituted for maize when it was harvested in
November. But back in the Orange Free State, last week, farmers were
worrying about the continued absence of any rain to provide moisture to
germinate wheat seeds when they were due to be planted in a few weeks time.
</P>
<P>
Theirs is a summer rainfall area and that season is almost over. If they get
no rain, there will be no point sowing the seed and they will have no crops
to harvest next November.
</P>
<P>
As the minister said, that is a long way ahead and there will be time to
make arrangements to deal with that problem should it occur. But in the
meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers
and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South
African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow. Whichever way you
look at it this is a crucial time for South Africa.

<P>
TEAMS OF US and inter-national experts are being sent to southern Africa to
assess the impact on food supplies of what in some areas is the worst
drought of the century. Officials said millions of people will be affected,
AP reports from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Among the hardest hit of the 10 drought-stricken countries are Zimbabwe and
South Africa, traditional food exporters which this year will have to import
substantial quantities of grain. As the drought persists, estimates of the
grain harvest throughout the region have been falling precipitously.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating situation in southern Africa adds a new dimension to the
continent's overall food crisis. The north-east is the most deprived area in
Africa, encompassing Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. The lives of 15m
people are thought to be at risk.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Zimbabwe said last week 60,000 cattle died from starvation
during February alone and thousands more will die unless heavy rains come
soon.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation warned late last month that
the drought could lead to widespread famine. About 98m people live in the
affected regions in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
'Considerable donor assistance will be needed to avert a major humanitarian
crisis in the region,' the US State Department said last week.

FT  28 FEB 92 / S Africa drought 'may hit economic growth figures'
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE effects of widespread drought on grain production in South Africa could
negate the expected recovery in economic growth in the second half of the
year, Mr Kraai van Niekerk, the country's agriculture minister, said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, had been expecting the
recession-hit economy to expand by 1.5 per cent this year. However, Mr van
Niekerk said: ' As a result of agriculture's low production in summer
rainfall areas, there is a great possibility the expected growth rate could
be practically obliterated in the second half of 1992.'
His predictions followed warnings on Wednesday that drought in southern
Africa could cause famine in much of the region.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Food and Agriculture organisation said hot and dry
conditions in January and February were expected to reduce the total cereal
harvest in 11 southern African countries to 16m tonnes, 25 per cent down on
the average.
</P>
<P>
It said Zimbabwe and South Africa, which normally offset shortages in the
area with their own surpluses, would themselves have to import food.
</P>
<P>
Other than these two countries, Mozambique and Zambia were likely to be most
seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
The FAO said that as much as 2m tonnes of food aid could be needed for
southern Africa this year. Total food imports for the region could be as
high as 6m tonnes, three times more than in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
Logistical constraints could further exacerbate the problem, the FAO said,
with port handling capacities stretched by unprecedentedly large cereal
imports and neighbouring countries sometimes competing for limited rail
wagons.
</P>
<P>
It said meeting food aid needs could be difficult as international attention
was focused on emergencies in the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, Iraq
and the Horn of Africa.

   THE TRANSVAAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'Only God can help us through this crisis,' said the Afrikaner preacher
called to provide spiritual guidance to South Africa's farmers, who have
been hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the eastern Transvaal town of Bethal, where Dominee Nel was
delivering his sermon at a farmers' meeting earlier this week, elderly
residents say this drought is the worst since 1933. Mr JG Wilson of the
local agricultural co-operative says maize farmers in the area - one of the
largest maize producing regions - have already lost 80 to 100 per cent of
their crops.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural economists point out that drought years are more the norm in
South Africa than the exception. But Mr Koos du Toit, chief economist of the
South African Agricultural Union, says it is the worst drought he has ever
seen, and the most widespread. Farmers who produce maize, South Africa's
staple food, will be the hardest hit, with stock farmers also at risk. Mr du
Toit endorses comparisons with 1933, a highly emotive year for Afrikaners
because of the numbers forced off the land by drought.
</P>
<P>
The Maize Board, the state marketing board, expects a crop of 4m tonnes,
though Mr du Toit believes it could be closer to 3m or 3.5m, which would
make it the worst harvest in 50 years. The board expects to import 2m to 3m
tonnes of maize for local consumption, at a cost of R1.5bn. Mr du Toit
believes imports could hit 3.5m.
</P>
<P>
Government, for its part, has said that it will act to prevent farmers
leaving the land this time - although it has little room for manoeuvre,
given the fragility of the country's political transition, the depressed
economy and the demands of blacks for a fairer share of government spending.
</P>
<P>
None the less, Pretoria is understood to be contemplating substantial
drought aid for farmers: several hundred million rands, or perhaps as much
as R1bn (Pounds 200m) over two to three years. Without such aid, the Maize
Board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could
be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input
costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de
grace.
</P>
<P>
Given the ruling National Party's current unpopularity among whites -
especially farmers, who are traditionally ultra-conservative - this could
prove a serious political blow to the reform process.
</P>
<P>
But the alternative - numerous bankruptcies - could have a serious knock-on
effect in several areas. Farm labourers, most of them black, could lose
their jobs; with about 1m employed in farming overall, this could be a
severe problem. Businesses in rural towns are already suffering and more
could fold because of drought.
</P>
<P>
Millions of black subsistence farmers will also be victims of drought, with
the charity Operation Hunger warning that hunger could turn to starvation
soon in many rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Farmers say abnormally low rainfall and unusually high daytime temperatures
have just compounded the already precarious financial situation of many.
</P>
<P>
They complain of deteriorating terms of trade, noting that an imported
tractor which cost the equivalent of 191 tonnes of maize in 1985, had risen
to cost the equivalent of 347 tonnes by 1989-90.
</P>
<P>
Farm debt is another serious problem, with farmers struggling to repay debts
of nearly R16bn at interest rates of over 20 per cent. Low agricultural
output will depress overall economic activity, slowing South Africa's
recovery from a three-year recession. Real gross domestic product has been
forecast to rise by 1.5 per cent this year, though that figure could prove
much too optimistic if the worst drought predictions are borne out.

FT  29 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe counts cost of drought
 -Farm output is set to slump to a 30-year low
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the summer draws to its close, Zimbabwe's farmers are counting the cost
of what for most of them is the worst drought they have ever experienced.
</P>
<P>
Over the country as a whole, rainfall has been less than half the seasonal
average; in many southern and eastern areas, it has been between a tenth and
a third of normal levels.
</P>
<P>
Crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant
tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. Maize deliveries to
the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to
60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average
of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Cotton deliveries are forecast at less than 90,000 tonnes, down from 205,000
tonnes in 1991, soyabeans at 30,000 tonnes (133,000 tonnes last year), while
winter wheat production is expected to fall to less than a third of normal
levels. In the low veld, where rains have been below normal since 1989,
sugar production has come to a halt, turning Zimbabwe from a substantial
exporter into a net importer.
</P>
<P>
At ZDollars 3.7bn (Pounds 410m) last year, agriculture accounted for almost
20 per cent of gross domestic product, though in real terms, it was 8 per
cent below the mid-1980s peak. Flue-cured tobacco accounts for just over
half of this, and while there is likely to be some modest growth in the
value of its output this year, the rest, with the exceptions of beef and
horticulture will fall catastrophically; so much so that, in real terms,
farm output in 1992 is projected to slump to its lowest levels for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The impact on the economy will be devastating. Growth is forecast to decline
from 3.6 per cent last year to between minus 4 and minus 5 per cent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar,
exports of farm produce in US dollar terms will be sharply lower, with
tobacco earnings of less than USDollars 500m, compared with Dollars 520m in
1991 (28 per cent of total exports). The collapse of sugar, cotton, and
maize exports and reduced foreign earnings from coffee and tea will cost the
country at least Dollars 150m (10 per cent of exports) over the next 12
months.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country will need to import at least Dollars 350m
worth of maize, wheat, sugar and possibly, later in the year, dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
After allowing for some reduction in other imports and higher exports of
manufactures and some minerals, the balance of payments impact will exceed
Dollars 300m  - at the very least  - pushing the current account deficit
above Dollars 1bn, or 20 per cent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Financing this will be difficult given similar emergency food aid demands in
the region from Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. The traditional
suppliers of maize to these countries  - South Africa and Zimbabwe  - will
be importing up to 7m tonnes themselves this year (5m tonnes for South
Africa and 2m tonnes for Zimbabwe).
</P>
<P>
Compensatory funding will be available from the International Monetary Fund,
but when this and other aid commitments are taken into account there is
certain to be an unfilled gap in the region, which for Zimbabwe will mean
diverting other aid funds and export earnings to pay for food.
</P>
<P>
Transport poses an even more formidable challenge than financing. The entire
southern African region will need an estimated 10m tonnes of food imports
this year. Zimbabwe's needs are put at about 2m tonnes of maize and 500,000
tonnes of wheat, sugar and other products, while Malawi will need at least
1m tonnes and Zambia more than 800,000 tonnes. The port of Beira in
Mozambique is expected to handle a minimum of 600,000 tonnes of this
traffic, while the Zambians expect to bring in some of their requirements
from the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
But the main burden will fall on South Africa, which has dedicated the ports
of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London to regional food imports.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Spoornet, the South African railways, will run two liner trains
daily, each carrying 700 tonnes of food, though the frequency will increase
later. Zimbabwe's authorities will have to grapple with the problems either
of running the trains through to the main distribution centres, such as
Harare and Bulawayo, or transferring the maize to the Zimbabwe rail and road
systems at the Beit Bridge border.
</P>
<P>
While transport industry officials expect Spoornet to cope, there are doubts
as to the capacity of the regional systems in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia
and, to a lesser degree, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its direct impact on agriculture, the drought will have
far-reaching consequences for the Zimbabwean economy. The reduced water flow
through the Kafue Gorge in neighbouring Zambia has forced Lusaka to suspend
electricity exports to Zimbabwe, which next month will impose a 20 per cent
electric power cut. This will have serious repercussions on mining and
manufacturing, with mining sources warning that output and exports could
fall by as a much as a fifth.
</P>
<P>
Some mines are also in difficulty because of the water situation, while
mineral exports could be jeopardised by transport congestion.
</P>
<P>
The country's textile and clothing industry  - the main exporter of
manufactured goods  - has warned of production cutbacks and lay-offs unless
it is allowed to import cotton this year. The banks, already under pressure
to contain lending as part of the government's on-off credit squeeze, will
be forced to carry farmers' overdrafts through until the 1993 harvest. Next
year's crop and livestock production will remain below average  - even if
good rains fall  - as early plantings will be reduced because of a lack of
irrigation. After a drought-induced surge this year caused by destocking,
beef production will fall sharply as cattlemen rebuild their herds. The
dairy sector, like maize, was in crisis before the drought, because of the
government's producer price policy, which has pushed farmers into export
crops (such as tobacco), horticulture and even game farming.
</P>
<P>
At best, it will take the industry until 1994-95 to regain average
production levels of the late 1980s, while the economy as a whole is
unlikely to recover fully from the drought of 1992 for at least two years.

reported, including 1,203 deaths. On the Turkey-Iraq border, thousands of
Kurdish families still bury their dead and struggle to survive.;    In
Bangladesh, rescue workers continue to find drowned babies lashed to uprooted
trees, tied on by parents who wanted to protect their young from the cyclone
that devastated the country.;    "Interest in a disaster is contingent on
media coverage," said Alex deWaal, associate director of London-based Africa
Watch. "It's become a bit of a circus. When there is coverage, politicians
take an active interest and it becomes a policy issue. You're not seeing that
coverage in Africa yet.";    Other famines there, most recently in the mid-
and late 1980s, focused the attention of Westerners with the media's shocking
images of the crisis, including skeletal children suckling at their mothers'
dry breasts.;    Such photos of the current crisis are hard to come by because
of the lack of media coverage.;    "By the time we see the kind of pictures
that would motivate people to act, it will be too late," said Peter Laugharn,
coordinator for Save the Children's Horn of Africa program.;    Already,
however, hundreds of Africans in Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia may be on the
verge of death by starvation, relief workers say. Because of internal
government opposition, civil war and an undeveloped infrastructure, delivering
food supplies and obtaining accurate numbers are difficult and sometimes
impossible, they say.;    "We know there are places almost out of food," said
Rist.;    Just as the need is exploding, however, resources of relief programs
such as CARE are decreasing, according to reports from the General Accounting
Office and the Committee on Refugees.;    The United States remains the
world's biggest aid donor, contributing more than $250 million last year. And
some in Congress are trying to guarantee that money and the supplies it buys
get to their proper destination.;    A comprehensive hunger bill, for example,
was introduced by Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, chairman of the Select Committee on
Hunger. The bill would make it a human rights violation to use food as a
weapon, said a staff member. It would authorize U.N. intervention if a country
blocked aid from its population. Several African governments, including Sudan,
have been accused in the past of doing just that.;    Human rights violations
outlined in reports by Africa Watch and Amnesty International have led some
people to suggest that the United States and United Nations should attach
conditions to humanitarian aid. Otherwise, they say, food often is given to
soldiers, who in turn keep oppressive governments in power.;    Although
officials at the Agency for International Development won't confirm it, relief
workers say the agency diverted a shipment of food from Mozambique until the
country promised the food would be delivered to its hungry population instead
of to the army.
