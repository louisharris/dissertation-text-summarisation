In the two years since his appointment to the
U.S. Supreme Court was rejected, Robert Bork has found a new forum.
</P>
<P>
From his base at a conservative think tank he has become a
best-selling author and he's soon to hit the lecture circuit. No,
he doesn't think he will ever get another shot at the high court.

<TEXT>
<P>
The man who would have been a member of the
U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate is
quick to smile at the irony the last two years have brought.
</P>
<P>
Robert Heron Bork does not dwell on past disappointments. In
fact, he sees himself having a bigger impact on the law from the
sidelines than he would have had from the bench.
</P>
<P>
He says he is taking his case to a higher court, the American
public and the next generation.
</P>
<P>
One reason why is that Robert Bork, former Marine, former
practicing lawyer, former Yale professor of law, former solicitor
general, former professor at Yale again, former judge of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Circuit of Appeals, is now a best-selling writer.
</P>
<P>
To his surprise, ``The Tempting of America, The Political
Seduction Of The Law,'' has been on the best-seller list for more
than 10 weeks, and there are more than 190,000 copies in print.
</P>
<P>
Has that vindicated his views? ``I never felt the need for
vindication,'' he says with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
Bork was nominated for the Supreme Court in July 1987 and four
months later the Democrat-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee,
after an often vitriolic debate, found him unfit for the job. His
strict constructionist views of the Constitution threatened the
inclusion of women's rights under the 14th Amendment, and evoked a
public outcry from blacks and labor.
</P>
<P>
In the political undercurrent it was also remembered that Bork
as solicitor general dismissed special prosecutor Archibald Cox
during the Saturday Night Massacre in the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his office at the American Enterprise Institute, his
back to his word processor, he briefly considers what might have
been:
``I don't want to spend the rest of my life reliving it. I have
other things to do.''
He recalls the impact of a book he wrote a dozen years ago on
antitrust law. ``A lot of people were good enough to say it had a
great influence on moving antitrust laws from where they were to
where they are now.''
``I hope in the same way to have some effect with this one,'' he
says, pointing out the antitrust book had a greater impact than a
few opinions he might have handed down from the bench.
``You know if you are on a court, you are one vote. And you
can't sit down and write 300 pages of connected argument to show
why this is the right approach.
``I think this book has the chance to have more impact. I think
I am talking to the next generation.''
He says he has has received more than 200 letters from readers,
some short, some long, some funny, some analytical, all supporting,
he says. The law reviews have yet to come out, but one university
is planning four of them. The book is also planned for paperback,
which should reach a student audience.
</P>
<P>
Bork has plans for perhaps two more books, one in more academic
detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools, and another on
the relationship of law and the culture. He will hit the lecture
circuit this spring and fall and will teach a constitutional law
course next year at George Mason University. Occasionally he writes
magazine commentary articles.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps another shot at the court? ``I don't think so. I don't
think that's in the cards ... The first time around when I was
nominated for the Court of Appeals, the Senate approved me
unanimously, as did the committee.''
But now he feels the Senate has taken a position on him that
would preclude its backing down.
</P>
<P>
He relishes what free time he has. He is catching up on reading
he's not had a chance to do, making up for longtime neglect:
Flexner's four volumes on Washington, English philosopher John
Stuart Mill and his critics. He and his wife, Mary Ellen, eschew
most commercial television programs and rent videotapes instead.
``Popular culture as far as I'm concerned has gone straight
downhill,'' Bork says.
</P>
<P>
During the hearings, Bork was astonished to learn that a radio
reporter had gone to the video store he frequents and obtained a
list of all of the tapes he had rented. ``I guess he was hoping for
something really scandalous, but all he got was Fred Astaire and
Cary Grant.'' There is now a law against giving out such lists.
</P>
<P>
At his bedside table are mysteries, his other pastime, Martha
Grimes, Dorothy Sayers, John Dickson Carr, Margery Allingham. But
it's hard to follow a story when you read only four pages a night,
he says.
</P>
<P>
The sedentary life has taken its toll. Asked what his ideal
weight would be, he smiles and offers an understatement, ``less
than it is now. I have to get myself back in shape so I can get
back to tennis. I used to like to ski but I wouldn't dare now.''
He went skiing once when he was out of shape. He was halfway
down the slope, he says, ``when the muscles began to flutter and
that's not very good because you have to get down the rest of the
mountain.''
Bork enjoys the atmosphere at the American Enterprise Institute,
the conservative think tank that has become his small university.
</P>
<P>
His colleagues include Irving Kristol, publisher of The National
Interest, former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, former State
Department arms negotiator Richard Perle and political, economic
and social commentators such as Ben Wattenberg, Michael Novak,
Norman Ornstein and Walter Berns.
</P>
<P>
The institute does not make grave demands on its members. There
is an occasional brown-bag lunch where a speaker is brought in from
the outside.
</P>
<P>
Bork, who abhored grading papers when he taught, says with a
self-satisfied grin, ``It's a very good faculty, with no blue
books.''
The faculty often gets together for dinner. But, one suggests,
given that many active minds around the dinner table, the soup must
get cold.
``Not mine,'' says Bork.

One-time Nominee for High Court Argues Case Before Justices
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert H. Bork, who once hoped for a Supreme
Court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was there in the capacity of a lawyer _ apparently making him
the first defeated Supreme Court nominee ever to argue before the
justices.
</P>
<P>
Representing Citibank in a big-stakes battle, Bork argued that
U.S. banks with branch offices overseas should not be required to
pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The Senate rejected Bork's nomination to the high court in 1987
after a bitter political battle. He was branded a conservative
extremist by opponents.
</P>
<P>
Bork, nominated by then-President Reagan, has said he was the
victim of a campaign of lies and distortions led by liberals.
</P>
<P>
There were no references to that fight Monday as Bork engaged in
debate with the justices and opposing lawyers over the complexities
of federal banking law and related matters.
</P>
<P>
Bork was treated much the same as any attorney who appears
before the justices. They questioned him vigorously, occasionally
interrupting him for clarification and elaboration.
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who occupies the seat that eluded
Bork, directed a few questions at Bork.
</P>
<P>
Bork, 63, a former federal appeals court judge, is a fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute and will begin teaching
constitutional law in the fall at the George Mason University law
school in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
He will be paid $25,000 a year to teach one course each semester
as a part-time professor.
</P>
<P>
Bork was only the sixth man this century to be denied a Supreme
Court seat by the Senate and the 26th in its history.

BORK SEEKS JUSTICE IN 'THE TEMPTING' 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this town of reproach and recrimination, it seems increasingly clear that 
publishing well is the best revenge. In that spirit, one of the latest to join 
the parade of let-me-tell-you-my-side authors is Robert H. Bork, the former 
appeals court judge who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Reagan 
but was rejected by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
His version of the events is contained in "The Tempting of America," to be 
published in November by the Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
But at a preview-of-coming-attractions press briefing at the annual convention 
of American Booksellers Assn. in Washington over the weekend, Bork - the 
target of the first all-out, national political campaign to defeat a Supreme 
Court nominee - insisted that his book was more about the general "tendency to 
run law into politics" than about his own particular unhappy experience. 
</P>
<P>
His unsuccessful bid for a seat on the nation's highest court forms only a part 
of his book, Bork said. The contentious debate over his nomination is simply an 
example of what he sees as this country's increasing, dangerous tendency "to 
achieve political responses through the courts." 
</P>
<P>
"The consequence," Bork writes, "is a steady erosion of the most basic American 
right, the right of the people to govern themselves when the Constitution does 
not say otherwise." By politicizing the courts, Bork elaborated, Americans have 
eaten away at "the people's right to legislate the laws we want to live by." 
</P>
<P>
No better example comes to mind, Bork said, than the ongoing furor over 
abortion. As a federal judge in Washington, he recalled, "my office overlooked 
Pennsylvania Avenue." Twice a year, "there was a march, once by 
pro-abortionists and once by anti-abortionists." 
</P>
<P>
But as the protesters proceeded up Capitol Hill, "they went straight past both 
houses of Congress with nary a pause, and straight to the Supreme Court," Bork 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"So far as they were concerned, for their purposes, the Supreme Court was their 
branch." Both sides, Bork said, "regard the court as in large part not a legal 
institution, but a political body." 
</P>
<P>
To Bork, "that means that a major heresy has entered into the American 
political system." The constitutional sacrilege, Bork contends, is "the 
introduction of the denial that judges are bound by law." 
</P>
<P>
Bork's constitutional expertise was one of the qualities that Reagan said 
figured strongly in his decision to nominate Bork for the Supreme Court and to 
support Bork's decision to tough out his bitter, ultimately unsuccessful 
five-month fight for the position in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But his rigidness and his archconservative views frightened many people, inside 
and outside the Senate. Many feared his effect on Supreme Court decisions 
because they said he already was too arrogant when contending that his 
interpretations of the law were the ones that best matched the original intent 
of the framers of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The Founders of this nation thought the primary means of assuring our liberty 
was not the courts," Bork said this weekend, "but rather the assignment of 
different functions to different branches of government." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the Constitution specified that laws were to be made by legislators who 
were elected by the people, not judges appointed by the President, Bork said, 
"a lot of Americans now simply assume that the courts should produce results 
they like rather than sticking to the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
'The Great Temptation' 
</P>
<P>
Though without its subtitle, "The Political Seduction of the Law," a book 
called "The Tempting of America" does sound rather like a collection of 
regional dessert recipes, Bork maintains that mass assumption explains "the 
great temptation," expecting "political results from the courts." 
</P>
<P>
In his own confirmation hearings, "many senators wanted political results from 
the courts," Bork said. "They had what they accused President Reagan of having, 
and that is, they had a litmus test." 
</P>
<P>
The angry sessions were marked by a level of communication that was "not very 
high," Bork said. "We talked right past each other." 
</P>
<P>
On the matter of Bork's leanings on possible Supreme Court action on the 
abortion issue, "I was told by two Republican senators that they would vote 
against me because I might vote to overturn Roe against Wade," Bork said. "I 
was told by two Democratic senators that they would vote against me because I 
might not vote to overturn Roe against Wade." 
</P>
<P>
But this "tempting," or political manipulation of the courts, long predated his 
attempt to secure a seat on the Supreme Court, Bork said. "It started at the 
very beginning of the Republic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not Just a Liberal Sin 
</P>
<P>
"Nor is it a liberal sin," he went on. "Conservative courts have done the same 
thing. But it is illegitimate no matter who does it." 
</P>
<P>
In large part, Bork blasts law schools for undermining what he describes as 
"constitutional legitimacy." With a wave of a beefy arm, Bork asserted, "The 
majority opinion in the law schools today is that the Constitution is not law." 
</P>
<P>
As he writes in his book, "A new generation of law school professors and other 
elite groups no longer trust the people enough to let them decide what our laws 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
Among consequences of this trend toward politicization of the courts, Bork 
said, is that "we may expect (judicial) confirmation battles that are 
increasingly bitter. We may also expect a constitutional law that lurches 
suddenly in one direction or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Constitutional law, in short, Bork said, has come to be seen as "a political 
weapon." 
</P>
<P>
Book on Legal Theory 
</P>
<P>
Now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, Bork 
said he has devoted the last 1 1/2 years to research, lectures and to writing 
his book. Much of it was turned out aboard airplanes on his laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
"At bottom," he said, his new book is "about legal theory." Nevertheless, it 
will tell his side of the story of his battle with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," Bork declared with the same bombastic assertiveness that became 
familiar in the lengthy confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I wouldn't want anyone else to tell it, would I?" Bork challenged. His 
furry eyebrows were arched decisively. End of discussion.

<TEXT>
<P>
In choosing federal Judge Robert Bork for the Supreme Court, President Reagan has tapped a leading architect of conservative legal theory - and has ensured a tough confirmation battle in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of the 60-year-old Judge Bork to replace retiring Justice Lewis Powell gives the president his third Supreme Court appointment and by far his greatest opportunity to alter the court's direction. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, with Justice Powell often the swing vote, has been narrowly divided for a number of years on volatile social issues, including upholding abortion and affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
But in Judge Bork, appointed by Mr. Reagan in 1982 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the president has picked a rare judicial - rather than a political - conservative, a judge committed to a narrow role for the courts rather than to the Reagan administration's political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
A scholar and formidable writer, the former Yale Law School professor has made his mark in antitrust law and a wide range of constitutional issues, urging judges to base their rulings on the intent of the framers of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
However, judicial conservatives most often tend to reach conclusions that support conservative political views. 
</P>
<P>
And liberal Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, fearful that Mr. Reagan's choice may upset the Supreme Court's moderate balance, have made clear they will fight any candidate whose views about the Constitution and the courts are too conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a Judiciary Committee member, lost no time urging that Judge Bork should be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"He stands for an extremist view of the Constitution and the role of the Supreme Court," Sen. Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
"No justice would be better than this injustice." 
President Reagan announced his choice yesterday afternoon in the White House press room, lavishing praise on the nominee's intellectual abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Bork, widely regarded as the most prominent and intellectually powerful advocate of judicial restraint, shares my views that judges' personal preferences and values should not be part of their constitutional interpretations," Mr. Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
He described Judge Bork, who stood next to him without comment, as an "impressive legal mind" and "a premier constitutional authority." 
The announcement came just five days after Justice Powell announced his retirement, citing his health and the approach of his 80th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, Judge Bork was the clear front-runner to fill the vacancy, being favored by Attorney General Edwin Meese and his aides. 
</P>
<P>
The only questions were whether to go with a younger conservative whose influence would last well into the next century and whether the strength of Judge Bork's conservative views would make his confirmation too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
While the White House put aside the age issue, the confirmation process is likely to be a contentious one, both in the 14-member Senate Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
But the expectation, even among some Democrats, is that Judge Bork will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
The initial skirmish is over when confirmation hearings will begin. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Democrats say they don't expect to start hearings until September, raising questions about whether Judge Bork would be approved by the Supreme Court's opening next Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan urged the Senate "to expedite its consideration"; his aides will push for a July start, although they aren't sure they will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination presents a political problem for some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork is a difficult target, since his intellectual prowess is widely respected in legal circles, even by those who disagree with him. 
</P>
<P>
Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, and Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, both presidential candidates, must satisfy liberal civil-rights groups that are already gearing up to battle the nomination and at the same time must avoid embarrassing themselves by using specious arguments, especially if the fight against Judge Bork proves futile. 
</P>
<P>
The president's nominee to become the 104th justice is a bear of a man. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet, over 200 pounds and rotund, with hair like a scouring pad and a beard to match, he is an imposing figure, made more so by his deep baritone voice. 
</P>
<P>
An affable man, he occasionally grows impatient with lesser intellects and inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Mary Ellen, a former nun, has been a calming influence, friends say, although also a very conservative one. 
</P>
<P>
It is his second marriage. 
</P>
<P>
His first wife, Clare, died of cancer in 1980, and he remarried in October 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork was at one time a cross-country skier and tennis player, and he recently resumed playing tennis out of apparent concern about his weight and general health. 
</P>
<P>
But friends say his pursuits tend more to the intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
He sometimes listens to books on tape while driving to work from his northwest Washington home, and while solicitor general in the Nixon administration, he pored over the New York Times crossword puzzle daily. 
</P>
<P>
He does enjoy a good party and has on occasion been the one to close the bar. 
</P>
<P>
At a solicitor general's office reunion in 1978, the dinner went some $250 over budget because Judge Bork kept the bar open well after the planned closing. 
</P>
<P>
He first caught the eye of the legal community writing about antitrust law as a Yale Law School professor in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, he earned his reputation as an intellectual, conservative legal scholar with an article taking a narrow view of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, President Nixon tapped him to be solicitor general, the Justice Department official who represents the executive branch before the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
It was as solicitor general that in October 1973 he fired Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, after Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Mr. Richardson's deputy, William Ruckelshaus, resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's order. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork returned to Yale from 1977 to 1981 when he practiced law for a year before he was nominated for the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Richardson, now a Washington lawyer, defends Mr. Bork's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Richardson says Mr. Bork considered resigning but that he urged him to remain for the stability of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sen. Kennedy yesterday suggested that the "Saturday Night Massacre" will be an issue, saying the president "should not be able to reach out of the muck of Irangate {and} reach into the muck of Watergate" for a Supreme Court nominee. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Judge Bork's prolific and forceful writings as a law professor and judge that have earned him his reputation as an intellectual leader of conservative legal thought for a generation of law school graduates. 
</P>
<P>
And it is those views that will be scrutinized closely by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless Judge Bork can demonstrate to me that he comes to the court with an open mind, I would have some difficulty," said Sen. Biden at a press conference yesterday in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Many civil rights and women's groups reacted quickly against the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"There is tremendous potential for rolling back the gains we have made in civil rights and civil liberties over the past 30 years," said Judith Lichtman, executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
And the AFL-CIO urged senators to refrain from endorsing Judge Bork until they can carefully review his record. 
</P>
<P>
Once a New Deal liberal, Judge Bork became more conservative while at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
There he studied economics under Aaron Director, a pioneer in applying economic logic to challenge a variety of theories and liberal beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, he wrote an article in the New Republic magazine challenging part of the proposed 1964 Civil Rights Act that would require desegregation of private facilities serving the public, such as lunch counters and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The law would impose the majority's morality on the minority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1973, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee he had abandoned his view and fully supported the civil-rights law. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, in a Fortune magazine article, he was strongly critical of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren, saying it "is in the process of descending in national estimation from a position above the battle to the status of a political institution." 
The justices, he said, "decide cases not according to the criteria they cite but according to their social and political sympathies." 
In that article, he described a landmark 1965 opinion recognizing a right to privacy that entitled married couples to use contraceptives in their home as "shallow, murky and rhetorical" and "one more slogan that some justices will use . . . in the process of writing their own tastes into the law." 
It was that 1965 ruling that was the basis for the Supreme Court's 1973 decision recognizing a woman's right to an abortion, and Judge Bork's criticism of sexual privacy has caused alarm among women's groups over his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in a 1984 appeals-court ruling, he declined to extend the right of sexual privacy to homosexual conduct and criticized the Supreme Court's record on privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"If the revolution in sexual mores . . . is in fact ever to arrive," he wrote, "we think it must arrive through the moral choices of the people and their elected representatives, not through the judicial ukase of this court." 
But some friends and colleagues say his views don't mean that he would automatically vote to overrule the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a true judicial conservative," says Dennis Hutchinson, a University of Chicago law professor, "and that means judges are supposed to defer to the decisions of the legislature." 
Another hallmark of judicial conservatives is putting great weight on the importance of honoring precedents. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1985 interview with District Lawyer magazine, he explained that he is more likely to stick to precedents in constitutional cases if so much legislation and so many other decisions have relied on them that "they have become part of the structure of the nation." 
But he hasn't said how he would handle challenges to controversial precedents on which the Supreme Court is divided: abortion, affirmative action, school prayer and school busing, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork has been widely and sharply critical of the Supreme Court's 1964 decision establishing the principle of "one person, one vote." 
His criticism is based largely on the view that it is purely a political issue that is best left to the legislatures to decide for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Views he expressed in 1971 in a series of lectures at Indiana University Law School argued that the First Amendment protects only speech expressly about government and politics. 
</P>
<P>
But he has since modified his position, concluding "that many other forms of discourse, such as moral and scientific debate, are central to democratic government and deserve protection." 
He excluded obscene and pornographic material from the First Amendment altogether. 
</P>
<P>
As a judge, he has devoted much of his energy to questions of what are proper issues for courts to decide, taking a tough view on when a plaintiff has suffered sufficient injury to bring a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1985 opinion, he argued against including sexual harassment as a form of job discrimination that is barred by the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
But in two 1984 cases, he cast votes giving a moderate reading to the free-speech and free-press clauses of the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
In the antitrust field, he has argued long and effectively that the laws were only intended to regulate consumer welfare and weren't intended to protect smaller or less efficient companies from competition. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he has often opposed government efforts to block mergers that created conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know him expect he would be a powerful force at the Supreme Court, although he was sometimes slow and even bored with his work at the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't the kind of judge who invests a lot of time trying to lobby others to join him, but he hopes to persuade them with the force of his opinions, associates say. 
</P>
<P>
If he gets to the Supreme Court, associates expect him to help form a strong conservative coalition. 
</P>
<P>
He is a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist used to stay with Judge Bork on visits to Yale.

 Justice Bork:
Helping to Restore
A Proper Balance

<P>
Members of the Senate will soon face one of the most difficult votes of their careers when they evaluate Robert H. Bork's fitness for the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Currently on the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., Judge Bork is recognized as perhaps this country's most distinguished judicial scholar. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a law professor at Yale and solicitor general of the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
As solicitor general, he was in charge not only of representing the U.S. before the Supreme Court but also of deciding when the government should appeal decisions to higher courts. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only position in government required by statute to be filled by someone "learned in the law." 
Commenting on Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, Geoffrey Stone, dean of the University of Chicago Law School, called it "a four-star appointment" and commented that it was rare "to get anyone with anywhere near his credentials." 
Indeed, when Judge Bork was nominated for the appeals court post in 1981, the Senate unanimously approved. 
</P>
<P>
Why then the current controversy? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that Judge Bork is a "neutral-principled" judge - a judge who makes decisions based on established legal principles irrespective of the "bottom line" of who may win and who may lose. 
</P>
<P>
As Columbia University law Prof. Herbert Wechsler explained almost 30 years ago, a neutral-principled judicial decision rests "on reasons that in their generality and their neutrality transcend any immediate result that is involved." 
Judge Bork's elevation to the Supreme Court may very well tip the balance toward this neutrality of interpretation, and there are those who fear that the court - no longer able to do what the individual justices may think is "good" or "moral" or "right" - will reject activist social, economic and criminal-justice agendas. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution, however, commands a neutral-principled approach to judicial decision making, and a Bork confirmation would help restore the balance among the three branches of government the framers so carefully crafted. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the framers specifically rejected a system that would have permitted the judiciary to exercise the legislative and executive functions it has arrogated over the past 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Two hundred years ago in Philadelphia, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention considered a proposal to join executive and judicial authority in a "council of revision" - a body that would have authority to reject and reshape laws enacted by the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal lost. 
</P>
<P>
James Madison's notes relate the debate: Nathaniel Gorham reflected that judges did not "possess any peculiar knowledge" of policy that would justify giving them that power, and Elbridge Gerry reminded the delegates that such a role would be "foreign from the nature" of their office. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in explaining the Constitution he helped to forge, Alexander Hamilton called the judiciary the "least dangerous" branch, despite the life tenure for federal judges, because it had neither "FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment" and because it could take "no active resolution whatever" in policy matters when that would require a choice among competing legitimate social values. 
</P>
<P>
Limited judicial authority was not a new concept even in 1787. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 years earlier, Francis Bacon had warned judges to remember that "their office is jus dicere, and not jus dare; to interpret law, and not to make law, or give law." 
The framers recognized that choices among competing social values should be made by the people's elected representatives and not by the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, however, many judges began to eschew the proper limitations of their office for a more activist role. 
</P>
<P>
They began, in the words of the late Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter - a social liberal but a judicial conservative - "infusing into the vagueness" of constitutional or statutory provisions their "mere private notions" of social policy and traded their black robes of "judgment" for the mantle of what sociologist David Reisman has called "omnicompetent arrogance." 
Law making - policy making - by judges has become so pervasive that, of late, many see it as the judicial function against which potential judges must be measured. 
</P>
<P>
This "bottom-line" mentality is why Judge Bork's nomination is at risk even though Judge Bork recognizes that constitutional interpretation must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing times. 
</P>
<P>
This is how he put it in a September 1985 interview, which appeared in Judicial Notice: 
"The job of a judge is to understand the principle that the framers were trying to protect, and apply that principle in today's circumstances, which the framers could not have foreseen. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea is always to protect the value or the freedom that the framers were trying to protect - and not some new freedom." 
Far from being ideologically partisan, as some have charged, Judge Bork holds fast to a neutral-principled approach irrespective of whose ox is being gored: "The sin of wanting judges to do good things simply because the electorate won't do them," he explained in the same interview, "is not confined to liberalism. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives have been known to be infected with that desire, too." 
Our system of justice was designed to resolve disputes and not reshape society according to the whims of even well-intentioned judges. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Webster once warned "that the Constitution was made to guard against the dangers of good intentions." 
He noted that there "are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to govern. 
</P>
<P>
They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters." 
In many respects, the judiciary has become the "master" branch of government because we have permitted judges' personal views to supplant the rule of established law. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork's elevation to the Supreme Court would help restore a proper constitutional balance. 
</P>
<P>
He should be confirmed.

Bork: Overqualified?

<P>
Judge Robert Bork is the most qualified American alive to serve on the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the great Holmes and Frankfurter have we had a jurist with such impeccable credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Legal resumes get no better than Judge Bork's. 
</P>
<P>
He practiced law in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Then he taught at Yale Law School, until leaving to become U.S. Solicitor General, the government's top litigator. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Yale as the Alexander Bickel Professor of Public Law. 
</P>
<P>
After a stint as a law partner in Washington, he was approved unanimously as an appeals judge on the District of Columbia Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Not one of the 416 opinions he has written or joined has been overturned by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
During this entire period, he has inquired boldly and publicly into the nature of law and our society. 
</P>
<P>
As a student at the University of Chicago, he made the conversion from mild socialist to enthusiastic democratic capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
At Yale, he moved from pure libertarian to the Founders' view of ordered liberty under the rule of constitutional law. 
</P>
<P>
He has written wisely on many topics. 
</P>
<P>
His "The Antitrust Paradox" is the book with the single most influence on the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Many federal judges look to his 1984 lecture on "Tradition and Morality in Constitutional Law" as a guide to approaching constitutional issues. 
</P>
<P>
His integrity and intellect have won admirers who range across the political and ideological spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Cutler, counsel to President Carter, supports Judge Bork as a jurist who "believes that judges should interpret the Constitution and the laws according to neutral principles, without reference to their personal views as to desirable social or legislative policy." 
Despite his pre-eminent qualifications, in the last few weeks an awful fury has been unleashed against Judge Bork, centered on the canard that he is somehow outside the legal mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Bork is not a "right-wing activist." 
He does not have a list of public policies he would use his clout on the Supreme Court to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Any likely alternative, such as Orrin Hatch, would be a much more activist judge, though a far less distinguished one. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork's critics do indeed have much to fear from him, but they have not been honest about what keeps them up nights. 
</P>
<P>
Their fear is precisely that the power of his intellect and scholarship would leave his stamp on the law and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
They do not oppose him because he is unqualified; they oppose him because he is overqualified. 
</P>
<P>
They would much prefer Senator Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork is the leading proponent of judicial restraint. 
</P>
<P>
This doctrine is nothing more radical than the assumption of our constitutional democracy that judges must be the "least dangerous branch." 
That judges should set aside the decisions made by the elected branches of government only when the Constitution demands it. 
</P>
<P>
That judges must not concoct new rights in order either to further their own political preferences or to extend their power over the other branches. 
</P>
<P>
That they should not obfuscate their opinions by inventing five-layer, three-prong tests. 
</P>
<P>
That they should refuse to hear cases that raise purely political, not legal, issues. 
</P>
<P>
These once-conventional doctrines are seen as threatening by the elites of the law schools, bar associations and judiciary who enjoy the power of activism. 
</P>
<P>
Judges are usurping the role of others by running school systems, jails and the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
To the hurrahs of many liberals, judges busily discover new rights in constitutional "penumbra." 
The Bork nomination, says Hodding Carter, "requires liberals like me to confront a reality we don't want to confront, which is that we are depending to a large part on the least democratic institution, with a small 'd,' in government to defend what it is we no longer are able to win out there in the electorate." 
Yet in attacking Judge Bork his opponents have not been willing to defend judicial activism against judicial restraint. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he is caricatured. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim he is an agnostic, yet in favor of school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
One case where Judge Bork ruled for a labor union against a federal agency was classified by critics as "pro-business" because unions are "in the business" of representing workers. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, he ruled against a conservative group picketing near the Nicaraguan and Soviet embassies. 
</P>
<P>
Which is it? 
</P>
<P>
Liberal or conservative? 
</P>
<P>
Or does he apply legal principles neutrally, without regard to the parties? 
</P>
<P>
The critics chased themselves into the corner of results-based evaluation of prospective judges by drawing the logical conclusion of judicial activism. 
</P>
<P>
Law is just politics, judges just politicians in robes. 
</P>
<P>
As the Justice Department says, they "view courts as simply another political playing field for competing special interests" with judges ranked "the same way they rank politicians: according to the number of times they deliver results desired by a particular special interest to further a political agenda." 
The campaign against Judge Bork is shrill, mean and anti-intellectualan assault on the notion of law itself. 
</P>
<P>
His critics are living evidence of how badly he is needed on the Supreme Court.

 Bork Hearings:
Fear and Ferocity
In a Senate Swamp

<P>
If Robert Bork's Supreme Court confirmation hearings this week can be said to have had a moment of epiphany, it came Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
That is when Judge Bork was explaining to Sen. Alan Simpson how Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the famous civil libertarian, had once upheld a law that allowed the sterilization of the mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
"Three generations of imbeciles are enough," Holmes had written, in what Judge Bork described, in charitable understatement, as "not (Holmes's) finest hour." 
Sen. Simpson then paused for a moment, looked around at his colleagues, and quipped, "Perhaps we ought to bring him back up here," and the hearing room broke up in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Simpson has a searing wit, but the unfunny truth is that, having written that phrase, even the eminent Justice Holmes would have trouble making it through the political swamp that passes for today's Senate confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Holmes would have spent much of his confirmation battle explaining how it was that he could hold such benighted views, and defending why he really wasn't prejudiced against the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork isn't Justice Holmes, though he is probably one of the half-dozen best qualified Supreme Court nominees since Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
He is surely the most prolific, as well, and so the capital's standing army of activists and senators has this week been busily replaying everything he ever wrote or said, all in an attempt to prove he is a judicial extremist, a threat to the republic. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork defended himself well this week, with scholarly precision and often with humor, but in Washington reasonableness alone is not enough to win a seat on the Court. 
</P>
<P>
By now, the politics of judicial appointment in the Reagan years has become drearily predictable, like a Herblock cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Any nominee at all at odds with the judicial orthodoxy of recent decades is immediately attacked as someone out of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." 
The essential weapons are, as Sen. Simpson put it in his opening statement, "a deft blend of emotion, fear, guilt or racism." 
The idea is to raise such a public furor about the nominee's "extremism" that the fanatic moderates who often hold the balance of power in the Senate won't dare risk guilt by association by voting in favor. 
</P>
<P>
If a nominee's reputation happens to be shredded amid all of this politicking, well, too bad, but that's life in the big city. 
</P>
<P>
The activists started things off by supplying the emotion and fear. 
</P>
<P>
A group known as "People for the American Way" papered Washington with ads headlining the case of "Robert Bork vs. 
</P>
<P>
The People," suggesting, apparently, that anyone who supports Judge Bork opposes "the people," not to mention the American way. 
</P>
<P>
The same ads implied that Judge Bork had no objection to "sterilizing workers," didn't believe in any right to privacy, and just might "Turn the clock back on civil rights?" 
The question mark was a nice touch, apparently meant to suggest the ad writers might actually have some doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Once the hearings began, the directors of these lobbying groups huddled amid the marble colonnades in the back of the Senate Caucus Room, smiling or wincing as events played out. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Neas, the amiable leader of the activist troops and the subject of a flattering profile in Tuesday's Washington Post, was always ready with a quote. 
</P>
<P>
"I think things are going well," he'd say, time and again. 
</P>
<P>
"We're laying out the record that shows how extreme he is." 
The senators themselves were more respectful, perhaps because they know that TV cameras have been unkind lately to inquisitors. 
</P>
<P>
Judiciary Chairman Joe Biden appeared to have taken a course from Miss Manners; he displayed none of the florid sarcasm that drove Ursula Meese to tears when her husband was seeking to be confirmed as attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The questioning, however, left little doubt about its goal - to suggest that Judge Bork cares not at all for the rights of women, of minorities, of the press, or of pretty much anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Hadn't Judge Bork done something "illegal," charged Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, by dismissing the Watergate special prosecutor in 1973? 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork explained - as he has dozens of times before - his moral dilemma in seeking as solicitor general to follow the orders of a president, yet also keep the special prosecutor team from disbanding. 
</P>
<P>
He succeeded on both accounts, as the special prosecution force's own final report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't Judge Bork beyond the pale, implied Sen. Biden, for believing there is no right to privacy in the Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork had to explain that, yes, there are all kinds of privacy rights in the Constitution (the First, 4th and 5th amendments, for example), but he didn't believe there is any "generalized, undefined" right. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't Judge Bork in effect a racist because he once opposed that part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that outlawed discrimination in public places? implied Sen. Edward Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork explained that he was concerned at the time about government coercion in private decisions, but that he had retracted that position more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
So Americans were left with the spectacle of this distinguished judge and scholar having to plead in public that he is not a bigot, that, indeed, he had once persuaded the senior partners in his Chicago law firm to end their quota on Jewish attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork's supporters in the White House believe that all of this helped his cause, that it proved he wasn't, as one put it, "a neanderthal." 
They believe he has improved his chances to win the support of at least one of the three undecided senators on the Judiciary Committee, and thus make it at least to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
If Judge Bork is not confirmed, however, the record of this week suggests that the reason will result less from his own failings than from the ferocity and distortions of his opponents.

 Experts Split Sharply on Impact of Bork's
Free-Market Approach to Antitrust Law

<P>
Legal experts differed sharply in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over what impact Judge Robert Bork's free-market approach to antitrust law would have on competition and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"A wide array of anti-competitive practices which have been specifically outlawed by statute or (by) settled Supreme Court precedent would be rendered lawful if Judge Bork's antitrust views held sway," New York Attorney General Robert Abrams warned yesterday, as the committee concluded 12 days of hearings on the Supreme Court nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But Donald Baker, a Washington lawyer and former chief of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said in a statement that Judge Bork is in the "mainstream of antitrust," which "means his antitrust thinking . . . . 
is widely used by antitrust practitioners, antitrust courts and even antitrust professors." 
Meanwhile, President Reagan launched a new, more vigorous campaign on behalf of Judge Bork's nomination, which is losing momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to representatives of groups supporting the nomination, he portrayed Judge Bork's opponents as liberal "special interest groups," asserted that Judge Bork would be tough on criminals, and said there has been a "deliberate campaign of disinformation and distortion" waged against the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Sen. Robert Packwood of Oregon, the only Republican senator to publicly oppose the nomination so far, said he knows of between three and five other Republicans who may oppose Judge Bork. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three I can count on for sure," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "They're pretty experienced and tough" and may be able to withstand White House pressure to support Judge Bork. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Packwood's prediction is significant because moderate Republicans are one of two groups, along with southern Democrats, who may tip the balance for or against Judge Bork in the closely divided Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic strategists say they need at least three or four Republican votes against the nomination to defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker yesterday dismissed an earlier assessment by Sen. Alan Cranston of California, the assistant Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Cranston said on Tuesday that he estimated 49 votes against Judge Bork, 40 in favor and 11 undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Baker said yesterday that Sen. Cranston "is the worst vote counter in the United States Senate today." 
Mr. Baker said that he counts "40 plus" votes for the nominee, "30 plus" votes against him, and "30 souls yet to be saved." 
Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the chief Republican vote counter in the Senate, also disputed Mr. Cranston's count. 
</P>
<P>
The full Senate isn't likely to vote until November, but the Judiciary Committee is set to vote Tuesday on whether to send the nomination to the Senate with no recommendation or whether to forward it with a positive or negative report. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Judge Bork, a federal appeals court judge, is a recognized expert in antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
In a book and other writings he has argued that antitrust laws don't always fulfill their goal of promoting competition, and has urged greater use of economic analysis to decide what business activities are anti-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
In yesterday's testimony, Robert Pitofsky, dean of Georgetown University Law School and a former Federal Trade Commission member, said Judge Bork advocates "an antitrust program more conservative than proposed by almost anyone else." 
He said Judge Bork favors making legal practically all price and other restrictive agreements between manufacturers and distributors, and that his approach to mergers between competitors would make the Reagan administration's "lenient" policy "seem recklessly restrictive." 
But in testimony delivered Tuesday night, Mr. Baker and University of Michigan Law School professor Thomas Kauper praised Mr. Bork's contribution to antitrust theory. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kauper said there isn't any reason to assume Judge Bork would overrule antitrust precedents or federal laws and that Judge Bork advocates an antitrust approach "designed to promote consumer welfare." 
In his White House speech to Bork supporters, President Reagan delivered his sternest defense yet of his Supreme Court nominee and his harshest attack on foes of the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
He said the vote on Judge Bork will be a "crossroad of conscience" for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not be satisfied with allowing special interests to determine the qualifications to serve on our country's highest court," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Reagan maintained, as the White House has for months, that Judge Bork's philosophy is in the "mainstream of contemporary thought." 
But the president also emphasized, in stronger terms than previously, his view that Judge Bork would be a law-and-order justice who would aid the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Bork has argued for more reasonable interpretations of criminal procedures that assure both justice and the prompt conviction of criminals, rather than allowing dangerous criminals to go free on unjustified technicalities," Mr. Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials think the view of Judge Bork as a champion of crime fighters is politically appealing but believe it hasn't gotten enough attention during the Senate's confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The White House intends to keep hitting away on this and similar themes. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan is scheduled to deliver another pitch for Judge Bork today when he speaks at the swearing-in of William Sessions as the new chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Who is this man a multi-million dollar ad campaign and a senator from Massachusetts said would turn back the clock on civil rights to the days of segregated lunch counters? 
</P>
<P>
Who is this man who would want to reopen such old national wounds? 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bork was the young associate in a Chicago law firm who in 1957 demanded that the partners end their Jewish quota and hire Howard Krane. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Krane is now a senior partner there, and told the Judiciary Committee that "Bob Bork is a person without prejudice against any group." 
U.S. Solicitor General Bork was quick to rescue Jewel Lafontant, the first black woman to be a deputy in that office, when she told him of her exclusion from meetings due to her sex. 
</P>
<P>
"The very next day was the beginning of my attending so many briefings," Ms. Lafontant told the senators, "I wondered to myself whether I had been wise in complaining." 
The deeds of Robert Bork in his personal life are matched by the words of his professional duties as appeals court judge and solicitor general. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is that the distortions of Mr. Bork's civil-rights record are nothing more - or less - than a grotesque lie. 
-Record as Appeals Judge. 
</P>
<P>
Bork opponents have tried to substitute result-oriented statistics for careful analysis of his legal reasoning to impugn Judge Bork as anti-women, pro-business, etc. Yet even on the basis of the opposition's anti-intellectual methods, Judge Bork's civil-rights record is clear. 
</P>
<P>
In his five years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Judge Bork has heard eight cases involving the rights of minorities or women - and ruled in their favor in seven. 
</P>
<P>
In no case did he render an opinion less sympathetic to minority or women's rights than the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more telling, his opinions are among the circuit's most notable civil-rights rulings. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's Emory v. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Navy, Judge Bork ruled for a black Navy captain who wanted to sue the promotions board. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was whether the military branches are subject to judicial review where civil rights are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork held for the first time that federal courts can decide these cases. 
</P>
<P>
Also this year, in Doe v. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberger, Judge Bork held that a plaintiff fired from the National Security Agency due to his homosexuality was illegally denied a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork has written or joined several opinions protecting women's rights, especially at work: Laffey v. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines (1984) demanded that stewardesses get paid as much as male pursers for comparable work; Palmer v. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz (1987) held for women foreign service officers alleging discrimination by the State Department in assignments and promotions; and Ososky v. 
</P>
<P>
Wick (1983) reversed the lower court to bring women in the Foreign Service under Equal Pay Act protections. 
-Record as Solicitor General. 
</P>
<P>
When the critics ask, where was Robert Bork during the great civil-rights victories? the best answer is that he was standing in front of the Supreme Court making the winning arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, perhaps the best measure of Robert Bork's civil-rights record is his four years as the government's chief litigator. 
</P>
<P>
Solicitors general have great freedom to file briefs weighing the claims of private parties in cases where they are not required to act as the government's defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bork used his position to argue more pro-civil rights cases than any Supreme Court nominee since Thurgood Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
In 17 of the 19 cases, Solicitor General Bork argued for the civil rights plaintiff or minority interest; the NAACP Legal Defense Fund was on his side in nine of the 10 cases where both filed briefs. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, perhaps the most lasting accomplishment of his solicitor generalship in the mid-1970s was building on the civil rights gains of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
He was ahead of the times in 1976 in Runyon v. 
</P>
<P>
McCrary. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was whether private schools can deny admission to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
This controversial case raised the conflict between the freedom of private groups to set their own rules and the public goal of non-discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The civil-rights law, Solicitor General Bork said, "reaches the actions of private individuals not in any way facilitated by state law." 
The Supreme Court agreed, with Lewis Powell dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
In several cases, Solicitor General Bork took the controversial position that plaintiffs do not have to prove the defendant's discriminatory intent in order to win discrimination cases. 
</P>
<P>
Black workers brought the 1975 case of Albemarle Paper Co. v. 
</P>
<P>
Moody against their employer and their union. 
</P>
<P>
They argued that they had been locked into low-paying jobs by testing policies and union rules. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bork successfully argued that even if the employer didn't mean to discriminate against black workers, the mere existence of a discriminatory effect entitled the plaintiffs to back pay. 
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Bork tried to take the law even further. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1977 case of Teamsters v. 
</P>
<P>
U.S., the Supreme Court refused to accept his argument that a wholly race-neutral seniority system is unlawful if it perpetuates discriminatory effects. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Judge Bork's record of public service to civil rights, Sen. Joseph Biden claimed that "throughout his career, Judge Bork has opposed virtually every civil rights advance." 
How can this be? 
</P>
<P>
The critics cite Mr. Bork's speculative academic writings - yet distort even these: 
-Brown v. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Sen. Biden was referring to, it couldn't have been the landmark Supreme Court case that desegregated the public schools and gave courage to a politically deadlocked Congress to act on civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork has said that by the 1954 Brown case, "it had become abundantly apparent through repeated litigation that separate was never equal." 
This isn't a recent conversion: In a 1968 Fortune article, he called the ruling "surely correct." 
In his 1971 Indiana Law Review article, then-Yale Prof. Bork said that the 14th Amendment "was intended to enforce a core idea of black equality against governmental discrimination." 
At a Federalist Society meeting this past January, Judge Bork defended Brown's reasoning against critics who insisted that the 14th Amendment was not intended to prohibit segregated schools. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "To have chosen separation rather than equality would have been to read the equal protection clause out of the Constitution." 
Judge Bork calls Brown "perhaps the greatest moral achievement of our constitutional law." 
-Public Accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been made of Mr. Bork's three-page article in The New Republic in 1963 making the libertarian case against government-coerced desegregation of private establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the segregationists, he was not motivated by a desire for racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he stipulated that "of the ugliness of racial discrimination there need be no argument." 
Instead, his purpose was to warn against the dangers of government intervention into private relations even for a cause as noble as desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sad to have to defend the principle of freedom in this context," he wrote, "but the task ought not to be left to those Southern politicians who only a short while ago were defending laws that enforced racial segregation." 
Robert Bork long ago rejected the extreme libertarian argument. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 "did an enormous amount to bring the country together and bring blacks into the mainstream," he said at his 1973 confirmation hearings as solicitor general. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the way I should have judged the statute in the first place instead of on these abstract libertarian principles." 
Does this sound like someone who would undo racial progress? 
-Voting Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Judge Bork make the startling claim that he favors poll taxes, the device once used to deny blacks their right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork told the Judiciary Committee that he has "no desire to bring poll taxes back into existence. 
</P>
<P>
I do not like them myself." 
He has criticized Harper v. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Board of Education, the 1966 case that invalidated state poll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But the case had nothing to do with race. 
</P>
<P>
The high court in Harper explicitly said that there was no evidence of any racially discriminatory application of the $1.50 poll tax. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork told the committee that if the tax had been "applied in a discriminatory fashion, it would have clearly been unconstitutional." 
Judge Bork's point was that if there is no racial discrimination, then there can be no equal-protection-clause justification to invalidate a state poll tax. 
</P>
<P>
The 24th Amendment, he noted, prohibited only federal poll taxes, intentionally leaving states free to assess such taxes if they chose. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork has said that a better ground for invalidating a poll tax would be if it were so high an amount that it interfered with the constitutional provision guaranteeing a republican form of government. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Judge Bork's extraordinary civil-rights record, there is a strong argument that minorities above all others should demand judicial restraint and an honest reading of the Constitution and its civil rights amendments. 
</P>
<P>
If justices of the William Brennan variety can make the Constitution mean what they like it to mean, the Supreme Court becomes another branch of government subject to buffeting by public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The history of activist judges until recently is a history of black oppression; justices in Plessey v. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson (1896) ignored the text of the 14th Amendment to create separate but equal. 
</P>
<P>
Judges such as Robert Bork insist that the law adhere to the Constitution, preserving a text that protects minority rights that today could again lose popularvor. 
</P>
<P>
A reading of Judge Bork's voluminous cvil rights record leaves the inescapable conclusion that the partisan campaign against him was one of intentional distortion. 
</P>
<P>
If only the special interests had shown a fraction of the compassion for the truth as Robert Bork has shown for minorities. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, senators who take the time to review his record will find no honest argument that minorities or women have anything to fear from a Justice Bork.

As the Senate takes up Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, we would like to believe that there might be some senators among his declared opponents with the statesmanship to admit they were initially misinformed. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the more evidence that accumulates, the more heatedly they seem to deny it. 
</P>
<P>
If these deliberations are serious, the evidence on this page and elsewhere the past two weeks should cause some thoughtful senators to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
The true record of Judge Bork could not be more different from the claims of Archie Bunker ads and Archie Bunker senators. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the smears, Robert Bork has not been a racist, sexist, sterilizer or bedroom spy in his careers as Yale law professor, U.S. solicitor general or appeals judge. 
</P>
<P>
His civil-rights record? 
</P>
<P>
As judge, he's sided with the minority plaintiff in seven of eight cases. 
</P>
<P>
As solicitor general, he argued more civil-rights cases than any Supreme Court nominee since Thurgood Marshall, urging an extension of a civil right in 17 of 19 cases. 
</P>
<P>
Women? 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bork ordered Northwest Airlines to pay stewardesses as much as male pursers for comparable jobs. 
</P>
<P>
He wants a new reasonableness standard for the 14th Amendment that would effectively adopt the Equal Rights Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Privacy? 
</P>
<P>
He ridicules the flighty excesses of the Warren Court, but refers to settled First, Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The bloody campaign of distortion now lies dissected. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Neas was already gunning for whoever was nominated to replace Lewis Powell when Teddy Kennedy rallied the troops with his outrageous speech. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbyists actually did a poll to find the best issues for distorting Judge Bork's views. 
</P>
<P>
Even Harvard's Laurence Tribe got into the game by mischaracterizing Judge Bork's Ninth Amendment views, not to mention Justice Black's. 
</P>
<P>
A Howard Metzenbaum staffer successfully and possibly criminally intimidated a black law professor into canceling his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Jewel LaFontant had to risk a threatened boycott of Revlon to testify for Judge Bork. 
</P>
<P>
A Harris Poll that included a falsified quote from Judge Bork was trumpeted to "prove" that most Americans opposed Judge Bork. 
</P>
<P>
Now, to justify supporting this assault, the supposedly statesmanlike Howell Heflin is attacking Judge Bork from the right. 
</P>
<P>
He told an Alabama radio station that he "was troubled by Judge Bork's extremism - an admission that he had been a socialist, a libertarian, that he nearly became a Communist, and actually recruited people to attend Communist Party meetings, and had a strange life style. 
</P>
<P>
I was further disturbed by his refusal to discuss his belief in God - or the lack thereof." 
The liberal Advocacy Institute has scheduled a seminar for Monday on how the left beat Judge Bork. 
</P>
<P>
The theme is that "facts count, but symbols may count even more." 
With the success of this campaign, in short, it will be open season on the independence of the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
The symbols they created for Judge Bork were brazen lies about a distinguished jurist. 
</P>
<P>
His opponents will take the nation's finest legal scholar for mounting as a trophy. 
</P>
<P>
But in our experience, this is the sort of victory for which the victors eventually pay.
