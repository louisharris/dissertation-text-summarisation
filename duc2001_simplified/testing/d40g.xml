WASHINGTON WIRE: The White House's Candidate for Bush's Job
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the White House as elsewhere, Vice
President George Bush's search for a running mate has people
guessing _ and now one of their own is part of the guessing game.
</P>
<P>
President Reagan says he's just guessing along with everybody
else.
``I don't have a candidate,'' he said Wednesday when asked about
it. ``That's up to him.''
Reagan also was asked about a newspaper column suggesting his
national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, as a
possibility for the second spot on the ticket. Powell is the first
black ever to hold the post of national security adviser.
``You'd better watch out,'' the president quipped. ``He's
standing right behind you.''
Powell, stationed behind the group of reporters who were
questioning Reagan during an Oval Office photo opportunity, made no
comment.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked what he thought of
Powell as a vice presidential prospect, said, ``Colin Powell is a
great American and would be an outstanding candidate for any
position. I hope he's listening to this.''
Fitzwater's daily briefings are piped into the offices of top
White House aides.
</P>
<P>
Later, as Reagan bade farewell to visiting Icelandic Prime
Minister Thorsteinn Palsson in the White House East Room, the
question came up again.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, responding to a
reporter's query, nodded toward Powell and said with a grin, ``He's
my candidate.''
Powell just grinned and shook his head but said nothing.
</P>
<P>
Before he went to the Pentagon, Carlucci had Powell's job, and
Powell was his deputy.
</P>
<P>
The most recent thing Powell has said about his future was in a
speech to the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles on July 19.
``As for myself,'' he said, ``I expect to go back to a nice
quiet foxhole where I can serve my country in a more comfortable
and perhaps less exposed position.''
Powell is an army officer and, before becoming Carlucci's deputy
in January 1987, was commanding General of V Corps in Frankfurt,
West Germany.
</P>
<P>
The questions about his future were spurred by a column in
Wednesday's Washington post by William Raspberry suggesting that it
would be a ``brilliant idea'' for Bush to pick Powell as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
Despite the jesting tone of the questions and answers, it's not
just a joke.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., who is himself a potential vice
presidential candidate, is among those who have mentioned Powell as
a possible Bush running mate.
</P>
<P>
The congressman's press secretary, Marci Robinson, said Kemp
believes Powell would be ``an exciting choice'' with the foreign
affairs and other experience to be able to serve as president if
necessary and that ``politically speaking, it would hit the
Democrats at their strength.''
Powell is the only current White House aide being mentioned as
even a remote possibility to be Bush's running mate, although
former chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. has been reported under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater was asked jokingly whether he is interested.
``I`m available,'' he replied to laughter. ``I ought to get the
honesty vote. I say it right up front _ I will be vice president.
</P>
<P>
Just ask. I never disparaged the job. I thought it was terrific
when I was on the staff.''
Fitzwater was Bush's press secretary before taking his present
job.

U.S. Plays Wait and See on Gorbachev's Reform Efforts
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Reagan's national security adviser,
Colin Powell, on Thursday credited Soviet leader Mikhail S.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev for pushing economic reform, but said it ``remains to be
seen'' how much improvement can be made under a communist, one-party
system.
</P>
<P>
Powell, an Army lieutenant general, said it has become clear,
however, that the Soviets have chosen to pursue a policy of
declining adventurism in foreign policy so they can focus ``energies
and resources on internal economic reform.''
``The bold new leadership in the Kremlin has candidly
acknowledged the problems the Soviet system faces,'' Powell said in
a speech prepared for delivery to the National Press Club. ``But the
problems are fundamental, even structural.''
Soviet officials in Moscow on Thursday said they will begin
liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the
nation's economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach $58
billion next year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet legislature
that Gorbachev's government is finding it difficult to bring deficit
spending under control.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Powell took his audience on a tour of world
trouble spots, saying resistance forces fighting communism and
totalitarians have made great strides in Afghanistan, Angola, and
Cambodia. But Powell said the push for freedom in Nicaragua has
lagged, at least in part because of divisions within the United
States on support for the Contra rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said a principal lesson to be learned from the various
regional conflicts is that American foreign policy has tended to
succeed in instances in which U.S. support was unquestioned. He said
this included Afghanistan, where the Soviets have begun pulling out
forces that have occupied the Southwest Asian nation since 1979 but
were fought continuously by the Mujahedeen resistance.
``The Soviets are correctly reassessing their past foreign
policy, including their adventurism in the 1970s, as a series of
mistakes,'' Powell said, because they and their allies were unable
to consolidate their gains.
``One lesson here is that sometimes leaders have the wit to see
the futility of war, to see diplomatic solutions,'' he said. ``But
the deeper lesson is that effective resistance to aggression is what
demonstrates the futility of war.''
Of the changing political climate in the Soviet Union, he said:
``Essentially, perestroika is an acknowledgment of the failure of
the Soviet system to provide for its people. Whether it can be fixed
as long as it remains a communist, one-party system remains to be
seen.''
But Powell also said that Gorbachev, who recently took on the
additional title of president of the Soviet Union with the
retirement of Andrei Gromyko, is facing problems with ``restive
nationalities in the Soviet Union and around the Soviet empire.''
This, he said, is going to ``preoccupy Moscow more than anyone
anticipated.''
``There is little we can do to affect the Soviet Union's internal
evolution,'' said Powell, who plans to resume his active duty
military career when Reagan's term ends Jan. 20. ``We can encourage
steps that are clearly improvements in Soviet internal political
practice, even if they do not correspond fully to what we know as
democracy.''
Reagan on Wednesday voiced hope that Gorbachev would free
remaining political prisoners in the Soviet Union _ as West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl had indicated following talks with Kremlin
officials.
``Our adversaries face a systemic crisis,'' Powell said. ``They
sense that their system is wrong but they are seeking to fix it
without changing it wholesale. It is not yet clear whether they can
succeed.''
``The immediate problem they're facing is an economic system that
is not up to the demands of the 1990s and the 21st century,'' he
said in answer to a question from the audience.
</P>
<P>
Powell said the Soviets will be ``left behind'' in global
economic competition ``unless they make the necessarty adjustments.''

<P>
President Reagan will nominate national
security adviser Colin Powell for promotion to four-star rank and
the post of commander-in-chief of the Army's Forces Command, the
White House and Pentagon announced today.
</P>
<P>
The promotion would make the 51-year-old Powell, now a lieutenant
general with three stars, the fourth black officer to attain
four-star rank in the U.S. armed forces. One of those four is
currently on active duty _ Air Force Gen. Bernard P. Randolph.
</P>
<P>
The promotion requires Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
In the new post, Powell would be in charge of all the Army troops
in the continental United States. The command is headquartered at
Ft. McPherson in Atlanta and has traditionally been a major career
stepping stone for senior Army commanders.
``President Reagan has the highest respect and affection for
General Powell and wishes him all success in his Army career,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in announcing the
nomination. He noted that Powell and Reagan ``have had a close
personal relationship.''
``He was the general who guided preparations for the Gorbachev
summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the
National Security Council following the Iran Contra investigation,
and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored
confidence in the National Seucirty Council itself,'' Fitzwater told
reporters.
``General Powell has been a friend and colleague whose advice and
counsel have been valued by all members of the White House staff. He
is a man of rare quality and distinction,'' the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Powell is expected to assume command in
April, 1989, when the current commander, Gen. Joseph T. Palastra
Jr., retires. Palastra has held the post since June 1986 and is
retiring after 35 years of active military service.
</P>
<P>
After leaving the White House Powell plans to visit a number of
army units before assuming his command, Fitzwater said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Powell's new job includes preparing soldiers
for world-wide deployment and to defend the U.S. continent.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming promotion was first reported Thursday by the Cox
News Service and confirmed a short while later by administration
officials. The Pentagon later released a short statement announcing
President Reagan's intent to nominate Powell for the job.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Pentagon said the FORSCOM position was one of the
few Army four-star posts scheduled to open in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Powell succeeded Frank C. Carlucci as President Reagan's national
security adviser after Carlucci was tapped to replace the retiring
Caspar W. Weinberger.
</P>
<P>
Carlucci was called back to government service by President
Reagan to replace Navy Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter in the wake of
the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair. Carlucci immediately
recruited Powell as his deputy, drawing him away from a major
command in Europe, and Powell moved up to the top White House spot
after Carlucci's move to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Powell is a graduate of City University in New York and received
an MBA degree from George Washington University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Commissioned in the infantry, he was wounded during both of his
two tours in Vietnam, once falling into a trap lined with sharpened
bamboo sticks, impaling a foot.
</P>
<P>
In 1977 Powell was assigned to the Pentagon as an assistant to
the deputy assistant secretary of defense. While later serving as an
assistant to Carlucci in the National Security Council, Powell
received his first star. He went on to become military assistant to
Weinberger before a stint as commander of the Army's Fifth Corps in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Powell's decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the
Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.

Powell Described as a `Soldier's Soldier' Who Likes State Of Today's
Army

<P>
Gen. Colin L. Powell, who is expected to be named
the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is described by
colleagues as a ``soldier's soldier'' who doesn't particularly like
staff jobs.
</P>
<P>
The four-star Army general, who became national security adviser
in 1987 and heads the U.S. Forces Command at Fort McPherson in
Atlanta, would become the first black to serve as the nation's
senior military officer.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell was highly
regarded by President Reagan, succeeding Frank C. Carlucci as
Reagan's national security adviser.
``He was the general who guided preparations for the Gorbachev
summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the
National Security Council following the Iran-Contra investigation,
and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored
confidence in the National Security Council itself,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
</P>
<P>
Those qualities were cited by The Washington Post in calling
Powell the ``antidote to Ollie North,'' the former NSC aide
convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal.
``Colin gets mad at me when I say this, but I think he should go
to the very top of the military establishment _ up to and including
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,'' Carlucci has said.
</P>
<P>
A senior administration official said in Washington on Wednesday
that President Bush is expected to name Powell to the position.
</P>
<P>
Powell took over U.S. Forces Command, or FORSCOM, in April,
putting him in charge of troop readiness and deployment for the
U.S. Army. In interviews since then, he has emphasized he's proud
of the accomplishments of the average U.S. soldier over the years.
</P>
<P>
In the old days, Powell said, soldiers would keep a pinball
machine in a corner of their barracks. ``Today there's a computer
there.''
On personal level, however, Powell doesn't always keep up with
the times. You'd only know the 1972 Chrysler station wagon parked
in the general's space each day was his by reading the four-star
decal on its front.
</P>
<P>
Washington colleagues have described Powell as a ``soldier's
soldier'' who doesn't like staff jobs. Carlucci says that Powell
has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that Reagan got
Powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the
general had turned Carlucci down several times.
</P>
<P>
In his time off, he tells young blacks to spend their lives
helping to open doors for minorities.
``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved
the way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this
spring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''
He tells of his battles with racial discrimination, recalling
the time an Alabama state trooper pulled him over for speeding in
the early 1960s. The trooper looked at the car, complete with New
York plates and an LBJ bumper sticker, and hissed, ``Boy, get out
of here.''
On the job, Powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining
resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he
became FORSCOM commander.
</P>
<P>
As leader of Powell is responsible for the training and
preparedness of more than 1 million active, reserve and National
Guard troops in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Powell's daily interests are more pressing: Keeping his troops
ready for combat ``with the hope they will never be needed.''
And in that position, he keeps a close eye on the Soviet Union.
``The Soviets are going through wrenching historic change,
beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system
is broken and has to be changed,'' he said at his FORSCOM
installation. But ``their FORSCOM is strong. We must be strong.''
Born in New York, Powell completed training in the Airborne and
Ranger schools and served in Germany and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Commissioned in the infantry in 1958, he was wounded twice
during two tours in Vietnam, once falling into a trap lined with
sharpened bamboo sticks and impaling a foot.
</P>
<P>
His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the
Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
Powell and his wife, Alma, have two daughters and a son.

Gen. Colin Powell: `A Complete Soldier'

<P>
Gen. Colin Powell, tapped as the next chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is widely viewed as an adroit
politician and pragmatic commander capable of representing the U.S.
military at a time of sweeping change both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to
become the nation's top military officer.
``I am ready to go to it and I look forward to the challenges
ahead,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
He's expected to win easy Senate confirmation and make history
as the first black and the youngest-ever officer to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
Powell, who served as national security adviser in the final
year of President Ronald Reagan's administration, will succeed Adm.
</P>
<P>
William Crowe Jr., who is retiring Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
Bush praised Powell, a decorated veteran of two combat tours in
Vietnam, as ``a complete soldier'' as well as a distinguished
scholar.
``As we face the challenges of the '90s, it is most important
that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff be a person of
breadth, judgment, experience and total integrity,'' Bush said.
``Colin Powell has all those qualities and more.''
Powell fits the mold of Bush's national security advisers,
like-minded pragmatists who favor consensus-building rather than
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Service
Committee, called Powell ``an excellent nominee.'' Nunn said his
panel will hold confirmation proceedings soon after Congress
returns from recess in September.
</P>
<P>
The four-star general's associates predicted he will work hard
to present all sides to the commander-in-chief.
``He was marvelous to work with, because he could deal with all
the internal conflicts'' that the National Security Council adviser
must resolve for the president, said Dan Howard, former NSC
spokesman who was recently confirmed as undersecretary of the Navy.
``Colin was an honest broker. ... He was very fair in presenting
others' viewpoints. That doesn't mean he didn't have one, because
he did. He was just very fair, and could present all sides without
putting a `spin' on it. That's a rare talent in this town,'' Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
Such abilities will be essential when Powell is called upon to
deal with the intense rivalries that can afflict the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Contests among the services are widely expected to reach new highs
as the military budget shrinks and the assessment of the Soviet
threat diminishes.
</P>
<P>
As well, Powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen
the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political
finesse with Congress are as essential as toughened battlefield
instincts.
</P>
<P>
Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the
Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have
outweighed his military experience. But those who know him contend
his mix of jobs, in command roles and political trenches of
Washington, will stand him in good stead.
``He's been head of the NSC. He's commanded troops in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He's dealt with the (National) Guard and reserve in his current
post and he's been at the elbow of the secretary of defense. He's
had experiences few can match,'' said Robert Sims, a former
Pentagon spokesman who knew Powell when he served as Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger's military aide.
</P>
<P>
Powell currently is commander of the Army Forces Command in Fort
MacPherson, Ga., responsible for the combat readiness of 1 million
troops on active, reserve or National Guard duty.
</P>
<P>
Along with his predecessor as national security adviser, Frank
Carlucci, Powell was credited with helping the Reagan White House
recover from the Iran-Contra affair. He was a key figure in the
planning of Reagan's national security strategy and for his summits
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
Before his stint at the NSC, Powell commanded the Army V Corps
in West Germany for six months. Earlier, he was Weinberger's senior
military assistant from 1983-86.
</P>
<P>
Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City
and raised in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 after earning a
bachelor's degree in geology at the City University of New York. He
got his first taste of the White House in 1972 during a stint as a
White House fellow at the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
Powell served in Southeast Asia as an adviser to South
Vietnamese units in 1962 and 1963 and as executive officer of an
infantry battalion and as a division operations officer in 1968 and
1969.
</P>
<P>
Holder of a Purple Heart for being wounded in combat, Powell
also won the Bronze Star for valor.

Joint Chiefs Chairman: Don't Break Military With Budget Cuts
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top military officer jumped into
the Pentagon budget battle Friday, arguing that hasty cuts in
military spending will end up ``breaking the back'' of America's
defense.
``If you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a
so-called peace dividend, you will get neither,'' Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a speech to
the National Press Club.
``As we get smaller, we also need to get better. If we do it too
fast, we don't get better _ we get hollow,'' he said, warning
against a return to the post-Vietnam War and World War II
reductions.
</P>
<P>
Powell's blunt remarks were his first major commentary on the
debate over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of
lessened East-West tensions.
</P>
<P>
A former national security adviser, Powell now serves as the
president's primary military counselor and coordinator of the
nations' military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Powell said that even though the Berlin Wall has fallen and the
Warsaw Pact has nearly evaporated, he has had to place the American
military in dangerous situations during his brief stint in office.
``I have been reminded again and again since becoming chairman
that this is still a dangerous world and that you'd better be able
to respond if someone challenges your interests,'' he said, citing
Panama, the Philippines, the Persian Gulf, Europe and Korea as
examples.
</P>
<P>
Powell said that despite changes in the Soviet Union, the
Soviets still have the ability to destroy the United States with
nuclear weapons.
``We must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a
decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the
enduring realities we face,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
The four-star general said that although Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev remains ``very much in charge,'' his policies
``are sowing the seed of his own weakness.''
The Soviet Union will remain a superpower well into the next
century, Powell said. ``So even as we reduce, we must maintain our
ability to deter and defend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Powell said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan released
earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five
years shows ``we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal.''
But the general also defended President Bush's $303.3 billion
spending plan for fiscal 1991 as ``a realistic, prudent response''
to the changing world.
</P>
<P>
The administration budget blueprint, Powell said, will begin to
reduce the nation's forces over time. ``On this glide path we will
reach a base force which I believe is not prudent to go below if we
wish to match enduring defense needs with enduring realities,''
Powell said.
``We know we will get smaller. That is inevitable, that is the
correct thing to do,`' Powell said. But if Bush's budget request is
cut back significantly, ``You will force us to start breaking the
back of our armed forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The general also took aim at lawmakers who are seeking more
severe cuts over a shorter period of time. Although he named no
names, House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., has been
sharply critical of Cheney's 25 percent plan, and Senate Armed
Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has complained about strategic
``blanks'' in Cheney's budget.
``We are looking ahead with our eyes open. We're cutting
programs. We want to close bases. We've frozen construction and
hiring. We're cutting troops, and believe it or not _ we're cutting
generals,'' Powell said.
``What we need are not more insights on how to trim the margins,
what we need is breathing space. We need to time to make the plans
work,'' Powell said.

GEN. POWELL BACKS EAST BLOC ON NEW DEFENSIVE STRATEGY; 
MILITARY: TOP U.S. OFFICER REASSURES WARSAW PACT THAT NATO WILL NOT LAUNCH 
OFFENSIVE OPERATION. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's senior military officer Tuesday endorsed the East Bloc's move toward 
a more defensive military posture and reassured his Warsaw Pact counterparts 
that the United States and its NATO allies will not launch an offensive 
military operation against Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Vienna, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, cited "initial evidence" that the Warsaw Pact is restructuring its 
forces in line with new defensive military doctrines in the wake of the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the encouraging signs, the West's key concern remains "the specter of 
confronting greatly superior forces armed, trained and suited for offensive 
ground operations," Powell said in prepared remarks at a Vienna session of 
defense chiefs representing 35 nations from both the East and the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout Eastern Europe we see the dramatic movement toward political 
pluralism," Powell said. "For the United States, as for any democracy, glasnost 
- public discussions and debates over military strategy and programs - is as 
important as perestroika. For through real glasnost, national security and 
military policies will no longer be the purview of the few but the 
responsibility of the many." 
</P>
<P>
Powell's remarks appeared to be directed primarily at the chiefs of Eastern 
Europe's military organizations, whose future roles in the Warsaw Pact are 
uncertain as a result of the the major domestic upheavals that have swept their 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Powell also met Tuesday for the first time with the Soviet chief of staff, Gen. 
Mikhail Moiseyev, an encounter that officials said would allow Powell to raise 
further questions about the Soviets' efforts to restructure their military 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military intelligence officials have complained that while the Soviets say 
they are reshaping their forces for defensive operations, they continue to 
deploy large supplies of spare weapons parts and huge ammunition caches near 
the East-West border, where they could be used by troops in an offensive 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
If the forces had genuinely renounced offensive operations, the analysts said, 
the supply and ammunition sites would be withdrawn from the border. 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna meeting came as the East European nations, several of which sent new 
defense chiefs to represent them, are debating the roles of their militaries at 
home and in potential joint military actions with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Several of those countries, including Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, have 
moved to impose extraordinary new restrictions on the use of their troops 
outside their national territories - gestures that Powell appeared to applaud. 
</P>
<P>
Contrasting the postwar origin of the Atlantic Alliance with that of the Warsaw 
Pact, Powell said that in Eastern Europe, "the instruments of war were replaced 
by the instruments of coercion. Throughout the capitals of Eastern Europe, the 
liberated became the occupied." 
</P>
<P>
Powell delivered his remarks on the first day of an unprecedented "military 
doctrine seminar" organized by a 35-nation forum that negotiates limitations on 
the military operations and practices of its member countries, most of which 
are European nations. 
</P>
<P>
Saying the seminar's task "is to help shape a new order in Europe," Powell 
defended U.S. military initiatives that have introduced to Europe new, 
long-range weapons designed to attack Soviet forces sent in to reinforce the 
first wave of a Warsaw Pact attack on Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"This NATO commitment to preserve territorial integrity at every potential 
point of attack . . . explains the NATO strategy of bringing force to bear on 
successive echelons of attacking forces," Powell said, noting that NATO would 
be overwhelmed quickly if it had to face the full brunt of the Warsaw Pact's 
tank armies. 
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances, however, does this imply the alliance's intent to 
invade and seize territory," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
He also echoed suggestions by other U.S. officials that American ground forces 
will shrink significantly in response to changed military threats in Europe, 
while the U.S. Navy is expected to remain large.

PANEL RECOMMENDS POWELL, 20-0, TO HEAD JOINT CHIEFS 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Colin L. Powell, 52, won unanimous approval from the Senate Armed Services 
Committee on Wednesday to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with both 
Republicans and Democrats hailing him as an outstanding choice. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate panel voted 20 to 0 to recommend Powell's nomination to the full 
Senate. If confirmed, Powell, who would be the youngest officer to head the 
Joint Chiefs, would replace Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The committee action came after several hours of a confirmation hearing at 
which Powell told the panel that he has "some level of confidence" that reforms 
might succeed in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Such reforms, he said, would give the United States "opportunities to reshape 
our defense programs, our national security policies and our armed forces. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
But he warned that changes in Soviet military capabilities, not budget 
restraints, should prompt the scale-back and called for continued modernization 
of long-range nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very premature to start basing any of our plans and programs and actions" 
on assumptions of Gorbachev's success, said Powell. "But I think it is not 
premature to begin thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
His comments came as senior Bush Administration officials offered increasingly 
gloomy assessments of Gorbachev's prospects for success. On the eve of a key 
meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, several U.S. officials have backed away from 
earlier expressions of active U.S. support for the Soviet leader's reform 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Expects 'Backward Steps' 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the rising skepticism, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam 
Nunn (D-Ga.) told Powell: "We certainly, I think, have to be prepared for 
backward steps to occur in the Soviet Union. Almost inevitably, we'll have 
disruptions and changes, perhaps with suddenness, perhaps at times with 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
In choosing the 31-year veteran to lead the nation's 2 million troops, 
President Bush skipped over several more senior military officers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easier decision simply to go down a few numbers, as we say, and pick 
the next senior officer," said Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the Senate panel's 
ranking minority member. "But here, a deep selection was made, which conveys to 
me that the President and his principal advisers thought carefully and long 
about this particular selection, and I think it was a wise one." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing praise for Powell, who would be the first black to head the nation's 
military services, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) called Powell's appointment 
"one of the finest appointments that our President has made." Nunn said that 
Powell offered "tremendous . . . talent, insight, and experience." 
</P>
<P>
Powell now serves as commander of the U.S. Forces Command, which oversees all 
U.S.-based troops. Those include the active and reserve forces that are slated 
to play a major role in the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to lawmaker's concerns, Powell said that he would make the 
military's role in the drug war one of his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reservations and I know that none of my colleagues have any 
reservations," said Powell. "The American people have spoken clearly on this 
one. We ought to be concerned about this cancer that is in our midst, and I 
think we do have capabilities to bring to this war," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Over Border 
</P>
<P>
"In Forces Command, I have got people jumping through their butts right now 
trying to see which forces that are available . . . (that) can be diverted from 
other missions, other training activities, to work with the Border Patrol and 
see if we can do a better job of sealing the border between the United States 
and Mexico," said Powell. 
</P>
<P>
Powell told lawmakers that as the President's principal military adviser in a 
time of shrinking budgets, he would "rather have (a force) that is smaller, as 
long as it's always ready to perform, as advertised, and when called upon."

  DEMOCRATS SHOULD NOT CEDE POWELL TO GOP  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARE DEMOCRATS missing an opportunity by ceding Gen. Colin L. Powell's
political future to the Republican Party?;    With the exhilarating success of
the gulf war, talk is already beginning of possible electoral careers for the
Pentagon leaders burnished by victory. There is ample precedent: Throughout
U.S. history, generals in successful wars - from George Washington to Ulysses
S. Grant to Dwight D. Eisenhower - have been rewarded with the White House.
</P>
<P>
Even if the wars aren't comparable, Powell and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf have
become true military heroes to a society that has not known any for decades.  
</P>
<P>
Although Florida Republicans are hoping to draft Schwarzkopf for a Senate
bid, he seems unlikely to trade his fatigues for a candidate's general-issue
blue suit. But the silky steeliness displayed during the crisis by Powell, the
first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has revived discussion of
moving Vice President Dan Quayle out to make room for the general on the 1992
Republican ticket.;    Yet there is some evidence to suggest that if Powell
ever decided to seek elected office, he might be at least as comfortable
running as a Democrat.;    No one, of course, can imagine Powell carrying the
Democratic banner next year against President Bush, his commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
But Powell's ultimate political fate does not now seem likely to be decided in
the coming election.;    It is true that many Republican strategists say
nightly prayers for Bush to replace Quayle with Powell in 1992. In a recent
poll, grass-roots Republicans - by a resounding 47 percent to 29 percent -
said they would make that trade in a minute.;    But with the gulf war victory
so dramatically strengthening Bush's re-election prospects - his approval
rating is the highest ever recorded - few now believe he will dump Quayle.;  
So if Powell, who is only 53, has a future in national politics it is likely
to come in 1996. And, as the general's career unfolds, Democrats should not
assume his loyalties lie irrevocably with the GOP.;    To begin with, no one
knows Powell's political affiliation. Like many accomplished military
commanders - Eisenhower throughout the 1940s, for example - Powell has kept
everyone guessing.;    In the Bronx, N.Y., neighborhood where he is registered
to vote, Powell has not stated a party preference. Though he has prospered in
Republican administrations, he also thrived in the Carter administration.;   
Publicly, Powell brushes aside all questions about his political ideology and
ambitions. Privately, he is no more forthcoming. Even among those on a
first-name basis, people such as retired Maj. Gen. Chuck Bussey, virtually
none can locate where the man stands in a partisan landscape.;    "I know
Colin, and have known him for a long time," says Bussey, who is black. "But I
cannot honestly tell you what are his political positions. I can tell you,
however, that proves how great his political skills are.";    As reticent as
he is, though, Powell has publicly expressed views on enough foreign and
domestic subjects to give some clues of his leanings. Clearly, his positions
on foreign policy and the aggressive use of U.S. force abroad fall within the
mainstream of the GOP, not the post-McGovern Democrats.;    But on domestic
issues, Powell has signaled values that reflect the experiences that shaped
him - a course that led him down roads many Republicans see only from inside
their cars, with the windows sealed and the doors locked.;    Powell is, after
all, not a product of comfortable suburbia, but a son of Jamaican immigrants
who was born in Harlem, grew up in the South Bronx, watched his parents
struggle to earn a living as a sales clerk and a seamstress in New York's
garment district, attended the public City College of New York and joined the
ROTC during the 1950s, partly because it was one of the few institutions
offering opportunities to blacks.;    Though some blacks have criticized
Powell for being too cautious in addressing issues of concern to
African-Americans, he has, on several occasions, pointedly indicated that he
has not forgotten those struggles. A few years ago, he told a dinner of the
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies that he was "mindful . . .
that the struggle is not over . . . that the struggle will not be over until
every American is able to find his or her own place in our society, limited
only by his or her own ability.";    More recently, Powell displayed
impatience with the progress of that struggle, when he told a congressional
committee questioning the large number of minority soldiers in the gulf war
that he "wish(ed) that there were other activities in our society . . . as
open as the military is to upward mobility, to achievement, to allowing them
in. I wish that corporate America, I wish the trade unions around the nation,
would show the same level of openness and opportunity to minorities.";    With
his foreign-policy views Powell would scrape against some encrusted
conventions in today's Democratic Party. But Powell's views do not represent a
new mold for the party. Rather, if he choose a political career as a Democrat,
Powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's Henry "Scoop"
Jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions
on defending U.S. interests abroad.;    The bottom line is that Powell
presents intriguing opportunities for both parties. Nominating Powell to a
future national ticket offers Republicans the chance to cement their
presidential majority by breaking the Democratic hold on black votes.;    For
Democrats, conversely, a national slot for Powell could allow the party to
simultaneously affirm its commitment to equal opportunity and dispatch
persistent doubts about whether it is tough enough to protect American
interests in an unstable world.;    If Powell hints even the slightest
interest, and Democrats are uncharacteristically alert, it could set off the
kind of bipartisan bidding war not seen since 1948, when activists in both
parties tried to draft Eisenhower as their presidential candidate. In the
meantime, Americans of all ideologies would be well-served to hear more of
Powell's views on the battles yet to be fought at home. (box)

 Washington Insight:
Reagan's New National Security Chief
Is Consummate Bureaucratic Infighter
-
By Gerald F. Seib
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
</HL>

<P>
Many past national security advisers have fancied themselves grand world strategists, yet have failed at the basic task of making the national-security apparatus run smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, by contrast, is an unpretentious infantryman who gets his kicks by buying old cars and rebuilding them at home in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
But he also is an experienced bureaucratic player who is skilled at operating the national-security system. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Gen. Powell, named the new national security adviser last week, appears to be the right man for the job at this stage of the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan foreign policy agenda has been winnowed down largely to the quest for arms-control agreements with the Soviets and the search for change in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The time for grand new concepts has passed. 
</P>
<P>
Now Mr. Reagan needs someone who is respected inside the system and capable of ironing out remaining internal disputes quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Powell, who has been serving as deputy national security adviser, fits the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"He always impressed me as being a good inside politician - a good infighter, yet also a peacemaker," says Michael Burch, who was an assistant defense secretary when Gen. Powell was Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's top miltary assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"While I don't know that he's a great strategist, he more than makes up for it with common sense and getting the right people together at the right time and resolving problems before they happen." 
Secretary of State George Shultz and Frank Carlucci, the current national security adviser and Mr. Reagan's nominee to become secretary of defense, are both better known in Congress and will be more visible, selling the pending arms-control treaty and other administration policies. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Powell, a genial and plain-spoken 50-year-old, is one of a special breed of Washington figures: He is well known within the tightly knit national security establishment, yet largely unknown to the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
He has combat experience in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a senior aide under three cabinet officers - Mr. Weinberger, former Defense Secretary Harold Brown and former Energy Secretary Charles Duncan - and has known Mr. Carlucci since working under him in the Office of Management and Budget 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Powell works the bureaucracy with a deft touch and he has a keener sense of public relations than many of his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
When the Reagan administration was planning its invasion of Grenada, for example, Gen. Powell was serving as Mr. Weinberger's chief military assistant at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
He was almost alone in the government in sensing that the Pentagon's press office should be given some warning of the impending operation so it could be prepared for the deluge of press inquiries certain to come after the operation was launched. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Powell convinced Mr. Weinberger to warn the Pentagon public affairs office a day in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon press officers kept the secret, avoided directly lying to suspicious reporters before the operation was launched, yet were ready once news broke. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, John Poindexter, then the deputy national security adviser, froze out White House spokesman Larry Speakes and even prompted him to lie about the operation just before it began. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Powell also has shown that he can present issues to his boss without seeming to impose his own views - a skill useful in maintaining the image of honest broker of ideas important for a national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues recall that when Gen. Powell thought an issue should be brought to Mr. Weinberger's attention, he often privately urged other officials to raise it at the defense chief's regular staff meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Colin is the consummate staff man," says Lawrence Korb, a former assistant defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Powell was so trusted by Mr. Weinberger that he was one of the few government officials who knew of the secret arms sales to Iran, and of Mr. Weinberger's strong objections and efforts to find out more about them. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues say it is extremely unlikely that Mr. Powell, both because of his own style and experience in the affair, would try to keep information from President Reagan as Adm. Poindexter did during the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Gen. Powell has told visitors that the National Security Council staff should function as a "collegial infantry batallion." 
It isn't a term a grandiloquent national security adviser like Henry Kissinger would have used, but it's an indicator of the kind of efficient and noncontroversial NSC operation Gen. Powell can be expected to run.
