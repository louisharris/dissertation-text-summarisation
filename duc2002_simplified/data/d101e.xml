  WHO'S REALLY BEHIND COUP? CONSPIRACY THEORIES
ABOUND  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The camera pans across the ornate furnishings of President Mikhail Gorbachev's
Kremlin office, then moves in for a tight shot of three men hunched over a
coffee table, conferring in the low voices of conspirators.;   "Then it's
agreed," Gorbachev says, sitting back and raising his eyes to the portrait of
Lenin hanging on the opposite wall. "It's the only way." The two others nod in
assent.  
</P>
<P>
Cut to a row of dour Communists in ill-fitting gray suits announcing
Gorbachev's illness and a palace coup. The camera zooms in on the impassive
faces of the two men last seen in Gorbachev's office.;   What is going on
here?;   OK, it's a hackneyed device that would only work in the movies. But
then, this week's events in the Soviet Union have all the makings of a spy
thriller.;   Kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories are working
overtime, though they insist that their darkest imaginings be clearly labeled
"pure speculation.";   "Once you have a palace coup, the possibilities are
endless," said Robert Conquest, a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution. "Russian politics are full of very strange things.";   For all we
know, Conquest joked, Gorbachev could be injected with drugs to change his
personality or KGB scientists could produce a body-double to impersonate him.;
"His friends would know, but would you or I?" Conquest said. "That would be
going a bit far.";   A more intriguing scenario has Gorbachev conspiring with
the coup plotters to engineer a transformation of the Soviet political
landscape. The thinking goes like this:;   With his popularity at rock bottom,
Gorbachev, a lifelong creature of the KGB, hatches a false coup in order to
step out of the way while hard-liners and liberals battle each other. The coup
falls apart and Gorbachev triumphantly returns with a level of legitimacy he
never enjoyed before.;   The theory could explain the apparent bungling of the
coup plotters, said author Joseph Finder, whose 1991 novel, "The Moscow Club,"
foreshadowed many of the elements of the current crisis.;   Finder, who said
he did not subscribe to the scenario, nonetheless pointed out that tanks did
not begin to roll until hours after Gorbachev's supposed arrest. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was not arrested, and Leningrad was left alone.;  
Speculation was not unique to Kremlin watchers in the United States.;  
Theorizing was rampant in the streets of Moscow on Tuesday, said San Francisco
businesswoman Kimberly Getto, who sent a long fax detailing speculation,
fueled by the fact that many of the tanks encircling the Russian parliament
building had no ammunition. Gorbachev did not want bloodshed, according to the
theory.;   The Democratic Reform Movement, headed by former Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's longtime ally, floated the same possibility
in a statement Monday.;   "It's highly implausible, but not to be excluded,
that Gorbachev himself agreed to a withdrawal, thinking he'd show them they
still needed him," said Norman Naimark, director of Stanford's Center for
Russian and East European Studies. "The degree of connivance is difficult to
gauge."

Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was said to be back in power today and
returning to Moscow as the coup against him collapsed and its leaders
reportedly fled. Tanks deployed after the takeover were leaving the capital.; 
Outside the Russian parliament, which served as the headquarters for
resistance to the coup led by Boris Yeltsin, rejoicing crowds cheered and
waved flags as the three-day-old coup ended. Soldiers, their tanks covered
with flowers, waved at television cameras.  
</P>
<P>
In the United States, President Bush said he spoke to Gorbachev and the
Soviet leader was "calling the shots" again. Bush said the hard-line coup
leaders had "underestimated the power of the people, underestimated what a
taste of freedom and democracy brings.";   The coup, one of the most
tumultuous developments in recent Soviet history, unraveled in a series of
swift and dramatic developments today:;   (check) Tanks and armored personnel
carriers moved away from the Russian parliament, scene of the worst violence
of the coup. A 2 1/2-mile-long column of tanks and trucks headed out of
Moscow.;   (check) The leaders of the national legislature demanded
Gorbachev's reinstatement. The full legislature nullified the coup leaders'
emergency decrees.;   (check) Press restrictions were lifted. "I'm sorry,
comrades, but I'm very excited!" said a Soviet TV announcer, grinning broadly
after he was allowed for the first time to criticize the coup leaders'
actions.;   (check) The Communist Party, apparently seeking to salvage its own
image, denounced the takeover.;   (check) In the independence-minded Baltic
republics, which had borne the brunt of the post-coup crackdown, some Soviet
troops began returning to their permanent bases. Latvia joined neighbor
Estonia today in declaring immediate independence from the Soviet Union.;  
The coup's failure could deal a fatal blow to organized, high-level efforts to
thwart reform drives in the Soviet Union by Gorbachev and Yeltsin and
significantly alter the balance of power that has characterized Soviet power
for the six-year Gorbachev era.;   The country's future course depends,
however, on who remains in power. Although Yeltsin supported Gorbachev during
the coup, the two men maintain different approaches to Soviet reforms.;  
Gorbachev's foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, who had dropped out of
sight during the coup, reappeared today and called the takeover a page in
Soviet history that "has got to be turned.";   At a news conference,
Bessmertnykh promised that reforms would continue and that Moscow would honor
its international commitments.;   The national legislature invalidated all
decrees made by the coup leaders, national lawmaker Yuri Karyakin told the
Russian legislature. He gave no details about the vote. Karyakin said the
legislature's executive council demanded Gorbachev's return to power.;   Word
of Gorbachev's imminent return to the capital came from Lev Y. Sukhanov, a
long-time Yeltsin deputy. He said Gorbachev would fly from his vacation
retreat in the Crimea to the Soviet capital with Vladimir Ivashko, the deputy
general-secretary of the Communist Party and other aides.;   With the coup's
demise, the Communist Party moved to salvage its own credibility. It called
the takeover unconstitutional and demanded a meeting with Gorbachev, the party
chief, the official news agency Tass said. The party renounced any connection
with the coup leaders.;   Thousands of people had kept up their vigil at the
Russian parliament building after overnight clashes with Soviet troops that
left at least four dead. They roared with approval when the announcement of
the coup committee's departure came over a loudspeaker.;   The plane
reportedly carrying the coup leaders was said to be headed to the city of
Bishkek, formerly called Frunze, the capital of Kirgizia, 2,100 miles
southeast of Moscow, according to Radio Russia, which speaks for Yeltsin. It
was not immediately known why the coup leaders would travel to Kirgizia.;  
The radio said officials of the Russian republic would try to intercept the
plane and have its passengers arrested.;   But sources at the airport told the
Associated Press that only KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov was on a plane, and it
was headed to the Crimea, where Gorbachev reportedly had been placed under
house arrest. He reportedly was accompanied by Communist Party No. 2 leader
Vladimir Ivashko.;   The republic-run Russian Information Agency said Vice
President Gennady Yanayev, the nominal head of the coup committee, was still
in his Kremlin office. The report could not be independently confirmed, and
the discrepancies could not be clarified.;   Bush, in Maine, told a news
conference that Yeltsin told him in a telephone call that he believed that
five of the coup leaders left Moscow and that one of them, Prime Minister
Valentin Pavlov, was in the hospital.;   Despite the force brought to bear by
the coup leaders, they were unable to dislodge Yeltsin from the Russian
parliament, where he rallied the opposition, to enforce the curfew, or prevent
large demonstrations nationwide.;   The state of emergency was declared after
hard-line elements in the military and Communist Party ousted Gorbachev,
declaring he was ill. Few believed it.;   The junta had seemed unable to cope
with tens of thousands of people who erected barricades around Yeltsin's
stronghold in the parliament.;   There were also huge anti-coup demonstrations
in Moscow, Leningrad, Kishiniev and other cities, as well as strikes by coal
miners in Siberia.;   Early today, before the coup fell apart, columns of
tanks and armored personnel carriers had moved around central Moscow. One
patrol of the armored vehicles was trapped by furious demonstrators just after
midnight as it tried to break through a barricade.;   Two people were
confirmed shot or crushed to death as the vehicles tried to fight their way
through, and witnesses said a third person was killed. A Russian republic
official, Col. Viktor Samailov, told the independent news agency Interfax that
four people were shot or crushed to death in the clash.

Gorbachev was set to board a plane in the Crimea, where he was vacationing

  THE VICTOR GORBACHEV MOVES AGAINST FOES AND THE
HERO YELTSIN LEADS RED SQUARE RALLY
PLOTTERS DENOUNCED AS 'CRUDE'  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail Gorbachev today furiously denounced the "crude and crafty"
plotters who briefly overthrew him but said the failed power grab by
hard-liners could prove to be an "enormous opportunity" to further his
democratic reforms.;   Gorbachev, moving to tighten his newly regained grip on
power and punish the coup leaders, declared at a news conference that the
Soviet Union had survived "the most difficult trial" of his six-year-old
reform movement.  
</P>
<P>
At the news conference - Gorbachev's first since the coup against him
collapsed on Wednesday - the 60-year-old leader condemned the takeover as
being against "the people, against democracy.";   Earlier, he told reporters
he would have killed himself rather than submit to any forced arrangement with
the coup leaders. "I said I wouldn't make any deals," he said then.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, I would have had to commit suicide.";   Gorbachev detailed his
purge of coup leaders, including Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov. He named a new
acting KGB chief, interior minister and defense minister, and said he would do
everything to "drive out the reactionary forces from the Communist Party.";  
Gorbachev pledged cooperation with Russian republic President Boris Yeltsin
but said he had no plans to leave the Communist Party.;   "I am convinced that
socialism is correct. I am an adherent of socialism.";   When asked if Yeltsin
now had more power than he did, Gorbachev said, "We have been bound together
by the situation.";   Looking and sounding angry, he described the plotters as
"primitive and crude and crafty" and scoffed at their announcement that he had
stepped aside because he was ill. "Their hands were shaking the whole time,"
he said derisively.;   Despite his display of anger, the Soviet president said
the failure of the coup could ultimately help ensure the continuation of his
reforms. "We have to see this as an enormous opportunity," he said.;   At his
news conference, Gorbachev made a point of publicly praising Yeltsin, whose
folk-hero stature was enhanced during the coup as he rallied hundreds of
thousands of his supporters to resist.;   Before dawn today, Gorbachev flew
back to Moscow from the Crimea, where he had been confined to his summer home
during his brief ouster.;   The Soviet president, who was reported to have
slept for a few hours in his dacha outside Moscow after returning from the
Crimea, arrived at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport unannounced, under heavy security.
</P>
<P>
He looked somewhat disheveled, clad in a windbreaker and a shirt with open
collar.;   Appearing on Soviet television after his arrival, Gorbachev looked
haggard and unshaven, with deep lines around his eyes and mouth. Later, at his
news conference, he at first spoke haltingly, but then appeared to recover his
composure and spoke in a forceful voice.;   Gorbachev said his captors cut off
all communication and that his only source of news during the coup had been
from foreign broadcasts, including the BBC and Voice of America, received on a
makeshift radio set up by his personal guards.;   "This has been a very
difficult, an extremely difficult lesson for me. It's my, you might say, my
drama," he told reporters.;   "Everything was done to weaken me
psychologically," Gorbachev said. "It was hard. It is hard to say it now, but
that's how it was.";   He said that early on in the coup, he tried to find out
who was behind it.;   "I picked up one of the telephones I have and it wasn't
working. I picked up a second, a third, a fourth . . . everything was cut
off," he said.;   "Every day, morning and night, I demanded . . . that my
communication be restored and that an airplane be brought immediately so I
could be returned to Moscow," he said. He was being held at his vacation home
in the Crimea.;   Gorbachev said the coup leaders demanded that he resign.;  
"I said, 'You will never live that long (to see me resign).' ";   He called
the crisis "one of the most difficult trials of the entire history" of his
six-year rule.;   Gorbachev said his 32-man personal guard stayed with him
throughout the coup.;   The 60-year-old president said the crisis had been
difficult for his family, especially his wife, Raisa, who "took it very
hard.";   "Best of all, my granddaughter Anastasia didn't understand anything
that was going on," Gorbachev told reporters. "She wanted to go to the beach;
that's all that concerned her. But the guards wouldn't let her go to the
beach; they were concerned something would happen.";   When it became clear
the coup was failing, Gorbachev said he prepared himself and his family for
the possibility that they would be killed by the conspirators.;   "You know
that it appeared as though they might have done something to me. They might
have killed me and my whole family and made it look as if . . . they were
acting in the name" of the acting president.;   "These people might have done
almost anything," he said.

  U.S. INTELLIGENCE TOLD BUSH OF SIGNS OF IMPENDING
COUP  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A week before the Soviet coup, U.S. intelligence officials warned the White
House of "a real possibility" that hard-liners in the KGB or the Soviet
military might act to block the scheduled signing of the new Union Treaty,
senior government officials said Wednesday, but they acknowledged they knew
too little about such plans to enable President Bush to act.;   The treaty,
which reduces Moscow's centralized control and strengthens powers of the
Soviet Union's 15 republics, is anathema to Soviet conservatives. And U.S.
analysts monitoring Soviet troop movements concluded six months to a year ago
that right-wing officials had started embryonic plans for a coup, the
officials said.  
</P>
<P>
As soon as the hard-liners made their move Sunday night - two days before
Gorbachev was to sign the treaty - it was obvious the coup was doomed to
failure, they said.;   One result of the bungled coup is that Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev - even though reinstated as head of state - "could be
irrelevant" to what happens next, analysts said. Even before Gorbachev
returned to Moscow, they predicted his future would be limited to a figurehead
role.;   "He lost by being peripheral to what happened. No one really came to
Gorbachev's assistance as leader of the country," one U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, opposition to the coup was based on "the illegality of the principle"
of usurping power and widespread fear that if Gorbachev could be "rolled up,"
then other democratically elected leaders could be, too.;   In the aftermath
of the coup, analysts also predicted that:;   (check) Major constraints on
Soviet cooperation with the West, such as the military's disaffection with
Gorbachev's support of Bush's strategy during the Persian Gulf war, will now
be greatly weakened or removed, although "a benign" Soviet Union cannot be
assumed in every case.;   (check) The coup's abrupt end opened the way for
faster democratic reforms, but it will not now "create Jeffersonian democracy
- or maybe ever.";   (check) The Communist Party is "dead" and will no longer
be a political force, although most of the country's bureaucrats are current
or former party members.;   (check) Gorbachev is likely to abandon the party
and move more aggressively toward reform.

  DEFIANT SOVIETS HAVE WON POWER TO RULE THEMSELVES  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing so important has happened in Soviet politics since 1917, when the
Bolsheviks seized power. In Moscow on Wednesday, the system the Bolsheviks and
Joseph Stalin created finally collapsed. A new historical epoch began.;  
Soviets had an experience comparable to those that transformed the outlooks of
Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and Slovaks in 1989, when they learned they could
finally be free. Soviets' courage in resisting this putsch announced the
arrival of a nation capable of self-governance.  
</P>
<P>
The "coup people," as President Bush dubbed them, could not have
miscalculated more profoundly. They thought the issue was Mikhail Gorbachev,
and apparently believed that by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening
everyone else, they could quickly take charge of the country.;   But the
people of the Soviet Union apparently concluded that the real issue was not
Gorbachev himself, but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy
that his reforms had created. For the first time in their thousand-year
history, Russians asserted their independence from autocracy, and the
autocrats fell.;   There will be much to sort out in the months ahead. But
almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the
democratic revolution it tried to choke. That revolution will alter the
country, creating a new, decentralized and probably smaller Soviet Union much
more quickly than anyone anticipated.;   Gorbachev's own standing also will be
transformed by these events. It seems unlikely that he can escape the
consequences of his own past miscalculations - especially the miscalculation
that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late
20th century, but this week he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin, who will now
rightly be seen as the man who saved him.;   Yeltsin had two talents that
Gorbachev lacked. One was the ability to stay close to the Russian people as
their world was transformed by Gorbachev's revolution - hence his thumping
victory in this spring's first presidential election in Russia and Gorbachev's
abysmal standing in the polls. Yeltsin's second talent was his eagerness to
challenge the apparatus of the Soviet Communist Party, the world from which
both he and Gorbachev emerged.;   Gorbachev could never shuck his party
apparatchik's skin. Instead of reaching out to new ideas and new people as
Yeltsin has, he surrounded himself with traditional Communist Party officials
and worried about the impact of new schemes and ideas. Gorbachev thought
Vladimir Kryuchkov of the KGB, Boris Pugo of the Ministry of Interior, Dmitri
Yazov of the Red Army and Gennady Yanayev of the Communist Party were
necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from
conservative forces that hated his reforms. Instead, they turned out to be
mortal enemies.;   If they had been only personal enemies, Gorbachev might
have been undone by them. But when they closed the new, liberal news media and
reverted to the Stalinist tradition of the big lie, the members of the State
Emergency Committee threatened not just Gorbachev but also the new Soviet
Union - a society that offered its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for
dignity, self-reliance and freedom. For years, Soviets and Western
Kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new Soviet
Union were irreversible. Tuesday, it became clear that they were.;   Of
course, Gorbachev initiated those changes, and history will credit him for
that. He also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those
responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend.;   It
is intriguing in assessing the coup's failure that men trained as thugs by
some of the most violent and mean-spirited institutions created by any state
could not, in their moment of truth, behave like thugs and kill their
compatriots. They left Gorbachev alive and Yeltsin at large; they let the
Western media report their coup as it unfolded; and they allowed foreign radio
stations to broadcast news of it back into the country. Even their own news
media, under strict control, conveyed the fact that there was widespread
resistance to their attempted coup.;   By Tuesday night, the Emergency
Committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of Yeltsin, and
this proved an unequal contest. As Gorbachev had previously discovered in his
negotiations with Yeltsin over a new union treaty, the legitimacy provided by
the 50 million votes that Yeltsin received in the elections for president of
the Russian federation was a formidable political force.;   At first blush,
the botching of the coup was surprising - couldn't the vaunted KGB and its
allies run an efficient putsch? But these were representatives of the
political class that turned one of the world's richest nations into a basket
case. Perhaps their coup should be seen as a desperate and forlorn effort to
deny a truth that proved undeniable - that the Stalinist system had failed so
utterly there was simply no way to redeem it.

<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin launched a sweeping purge today that dealt
a series of stunning blows to the Communist Party power structure, including
the ouster of top officials, the sealing of party headquarters and the
curtailing of party activities.;   Yeltsin appeared today to be acting at
least as an equal with Gorbachev, and the two clearly agreed on the
replacement of old-guard officials by new reformers. In fact, the two leaders
reached an agreement that permits each man to assume the other's duties in an
emergency, such as another coup attempt.  
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev threw out his foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, and his
acting defense minister, and named a new head of the KGB. And Yeltsin, with
Gorbachev's blessing, fired the heads of state-owned media.;   The Moscow City
Council, meanwhile, ordered all Communist Party buildings in the capital
sealed and all telephone service to party and KGB buildings cut. About 2,000
protesters blockaded the Communist Party headquarters in Moscow, declaring
they were trying to prevent the removal of documents that might contain
evidence linking party members to the coup. Some of the demonstrators chanted,
"Down with the Communist Party!";   Yeltsin, who had led the nationwide
resistance to the coup, announced a ban on Communist Party activities in the
Russian republic, the army, police units of the Interior Ministry and the KGB,
which for decades helped enforce Communist rule. Some of the many new decrees
issued by Yeltsin went beyond the official bounds of his power as Russian
Federation president.;   In his speech before the Russian parliament,
Gorbachev was compelled to affirm as legitimate the decrees issued by Yeltsin
during the three-day coup. It wasn't clear whether the Soviet president had
intended to back Yeltsin's latest decrees, and he balked at proposals by
Russian deputies to outlaw the Communist Party, saying it would divide the
nation.;   Gorbachev told the deputies that the government would prosecute
those responsible for the takeover. "They wanted to turn us into meat. They
wanted to annihilate us, and for that they must bear the severe
responsibility," the Soviet president said.;   He accused the Communist Party
Central Committee of panicking during the coup. "There are people who lost
their heads, all sense of responsibility. You could even call them traitors!
</P>
<P>
Traitors!";   At one point during the session, Gorbachev dramatically held up
what he said were the minutes of a secret Cabinet meeting during the coup that
revealed who backed the emergency decrees. He said many of them "hemmed and
hawed," but most voted in support of the takeover.;   Today's meeting
displayed unprecedented openness in which deputies repeatedly interrupted
Gorbachev and argued with him.;   Gorbachev drew applause from deputies when
he announced that the party's headquarters in Moscow was sealed.;   The
meeting of Gorbachev and Yeltsin was the first since the coup collapsed to
discuss the takeover and to deal with officials who backed the putsch.;   In
his speech, Gorbachev praised "the outstanding role" of Yeltsin, his sometimes
adversary, in halting the hard-line Communist coup. Yeltsin has been a strong
foe of Communist Party influence in the country; Gorbachev, however, warned in
his speech against "any kind of anti-Communist hysteria.";   Yeltsin often
commented during Gorbachev's speech, and Gorbachev deferred to him several
times on details of what happened during Gorbachev's detention.;    Standing
ovation;   The Soviet president's opening comments drew a standing ovation
from the lawmakers in the parliament. Yeltsin led the opposition to the coup
from the parliament building, where supporters rallied to build barricades and
form a human shield against expected attacks. The coup plotters never dared
mount a frontal assault on Yeltsin's headquarters during the standoff.;   As
the face of the Soviet government continued to change in the aftermath of the
failed coup, hundreds of angry residents marched toward Communist Party
headquarters in Moscow intent on proving the party was behind the coup.;   In
other developments:;   (check) Only one of the eight top leaders of the coup
remained at large early today - Oleg Baklanov, deputy of the state Defense
Committee.;   (check) In Kirghizia, Kirghiz President Askar Akaev said the
republic would take control of the headquarters of the Kirghiz wing of the
Communist Party, as well as the local Lenin Museum. Akaev said the party would
be compensated.;   Publication suspended; In Moscow, Yeltsin today
nationalized the hundreds of printing plants in the Russian republic.;   He
suspended the publication of six Communist Party newspapers and ordered new
chiefs for the official Novosti and Tass news services, charging they had
supported the takeover.;   The actions by Yeltsin, who quit the party last
summer, came amid a growing wave of anger at the Communist Party, six of whose
top party officials were arrested for instigating the coup.;   In a major blow
to the crumbling party, the acting head of the KGB today affirmed Yeltsin's
ban on Communist Party activity in the security service, Tass said. A KGB
directive also banned any other political parties in the KGB, for decades used
by Communist regimes to intimidate dissidents and anti-Communist activists.;  
Bold protests; The firing of Bessmertnykh followed criticism of his silence
during the coup. Bessmertnykh, 57, was the latest official to step down or be
removed after the failed takeover. He was not seen publicly after the coup
began, and he didn't re-emerge until the coup leadership began to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Bessmertnykh said he had been ill and unable to act.;   The arrest of the
former KGB chief and other Communist Party hard-liners inspired tens of
thousands of demonstrators to undreamed-of daring Thursday.;   They expressed
their anger and disgust with the organizations responsible for killing
millions of Soviet citizens and now caught conspiring to return to their old
dictatorship.;   At KGB headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Street, thousands shook
fists and shouted, "Executioners!" They smeared "Down with the KGB!" and a
swastika on the front of the building in white paint.

<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin today pressed ahead with a sweeping purge
of coup supporters, and the Communist Party suffered a series of stunning
blows for not opposing the coup plotters.;   Gorbachev threw out his foreign
minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, and the Communist Party was banned from the
KGB, which for decades helped enforce Communist rule.  
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told an audience at the Russian parliament that the government
would prosecute those responsible for the takeover. "They wanted to turn us
into meat. They wanted to annihilate us, and for that they must bear the
severe responsibility," the Soviet president said.;   He accused the Communist
Party Central Committee of panicking during the coup. "There are people who
lost their heads, all sense of responsibility. You could even call them
traitors! Traitors!";   Gorbachev and Yeltsin, the Russian Federation leader
who saved Gorbachev, met today for the first time since the coup collapsed to
discuss the takeover and deal with officials who backed the putsch. Gorbachev
named a series of well-known reformers to the posts of those who were fired.; 
In his speech, Gorbachev praised "the outstanding role" of Yeltsin, his
sometimes adversary, in halting the hard-line Communist coup. Yeltsin has been
a strong foe of Communist Party influence in the country; Gorbachev, however,
warned in his speech against "any kind of anti-Communist hysteria.";   Yeltsin
commented frequently during Gorbachev's speech, and Gorbachev deferred to him
several times on details of what happened while Gorbachev was in detention.;  
His opening comments drew a standing ovation from the lawmakers in the
parliament, where Yeltsin had led the opposition to the coup.;   Gorbachev
also told the Russian Federation parliamentarians that the leaders of the
hard-line coup had sought to arrest Yeltsin. "The president of Russia, Yeltsin
. . . was to be arrested, that is how I understood it," Gorbachev said, adding
the coup plotters intended to isolate Yeltsin.;   As the face of the Soviet
government continued to change in the aftermath of the 63-hour coup, hundreds
of angry citizens marched toward Communist Party headquarters in Moscow intent
on proving the party was behind the coup.;   Yeltsin, who led the nationwide
coup resistance, today nationalized the hundreds of printing plants in the
Russian republic.;   He suspended the publication of six Communist Party
newspapers and ordered new chiefs for the official Novosti and Tass news
services, charging that they had supported the takeover. It was unclear
whether he had the authority to order the firings.;   The actions by Yeltsin,
who quit the party last summer, came amid a growing wave of anger at the
Communist Party, six of whose top party officials were arrested for
instigating the coup.;   In a major blow to the crumbling party, the acting
head of the KGB today banned Communist Party activity in the security service,
Tass said. A KGB directive also banned any other political parties in the KGB,
for decades used by Communist regimes to intimidate dissidents and
anti-Communist activists.;   As Gorbachev and Yeltsin met, a crowd of about
1,000 people headed toward the Communist Party headquarters in Moscow, saying
they wanted to capture and preserve records that might prove the party
supported the coup.;   Calls for retribution have sounded since the 3-day-old
coup collapsed Wednesday, with Gorbachev beginning a purge of coup plotters
and thousands of cheering demonstrators toppling a statue outside the Moscow
headquarters of the KGB, whose former leader backed the ouster attempt.;  
Bessmertnykh is out;   The firing of Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh followed
criticism of his silence during the coup. Bessmertnykh, 57, was the latest
official to step down or be removed after the failed takeover.;   In in his
speech to the Russian Federation parliament, Gorbachev said of Bessmertnykh
"this morning I got information that at least he was trying to maneuver or
worse" during the coup attempt.;   He was not seen publicly after the coup
began, and he didn't re-emerge until the coup leadership began to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Bessmertnykh said he had been ill and unable to act.;   Also dismissed was
Soviet parliamentary speaker Anatoly Lukyanov, whom Yeltsin had named as the
chief ideologue of the plotters.;   Yeltsin, who stature rose with his
resistance in the coup, said earlier that he would insist that proven
reformers be installed in top jobs.;   Gorbachev told the legislators that he
did not want now to name all those appointed to replace the hard-liners, but
Yeltsin said that Gorbachev had agreed to appointing Maj. Gen. Constantine
Kovets head of the army. Kovets was in charge of defense for the Russian
republic.;   Six newspapers suspended; The six newspapers suspended by
Yeltsin, all based in the Russian republic, are Pravda, Sovietskaya Rossiya,
Glasnost, Rabochaya Tribuna, Moskovskaya Pravda and Leninskoe Znamya. It was
unclear whether he had the authority to fire the chiefs at Tass and Novosti.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered Novosti nationalized.;   In other developments:;   (check)
Gorbachev said he would meet today with leaders of the nine republics who
support the new Union Treaty. The treaty, whose signing was put off by the
coup, had angered hard-liners who objected to its provisions ceding more
Kremlin power to the republics. Gorbachev also was to make a late-afternoon
visit to the Russian parliament, Tass reported.;   (check) Kirghiz President
Askar Akaev said the republic of Kirghizia would take control of the
headquarters of the Kirghiz wing of the Communist Party and the local Lenin
Museum. Akaev said the party would be compensated.;   (check) Only one of the
eight top leaders of the coup remained at large early today - Oleg Baklanov,
deputy of the state Defense Committee.;   Coup leader kills himself; One of
the coup leaders, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, committed suicide Thursday by
shooting himself in the head as he was about to be arrested, officials said.
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by Lt. Gen. Vasily P. Trushin.;   Defense Minister Dmitri
Yazov was arrested and replaced by Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the chief of the
Soviet general staff. Leonid V. Shebarshin was named to replace KGB Chief
Vladimir Kryuchkov.;   Gorbachev's chief of staff, Valery I. Boldin, was
replaced by Grigory Revenko.

<P>
With the old order of Bolshevik power and ideology in ruins, Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev demanded the resignation Friday of his entire government and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin shut down Communist Party organizations
throughout the vast republic.;   Ministers appointed only Thursday by
Gorbachev were fired and replaced Friday.  
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, the triumphant leader of the resistance against this week's
military coup, has drastically tipped the balance of power here, showing
himself to be at least the political equal, if not the master, of Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
In a symbol of the new order, the Russian tricolor, the banner of the
anti-coup resistance, flew over the gates of the Kremlin alongside the red
Soviet flag for the first time since the rise of the Bolshevik state.;   In a
joint appearance with Gorbachev in the Russian parliament, broadcast live on
Soviet television, Yeltsin made it clear that the Soviet president can
maintain a semblance of authority only if he agrees to share power and
intensify the march toward a democratic political system and a market
economy.;   "And now for a bit of relaxation," Yeltsin said, interrupting
Gorbachev's speech. "Let me sign a decree suspending the activity of the
Russian Communist Party.";   Gorbachev, who has insisted the party is still
capable of reform, stammered a bit and then said, "Boris Nikolayevich, Boris
Nikolayevich . . ." With an expression that was half-smile, half-sneer,
Yeltsin broke in. "It's been signed," he said definitively, and the deputies
broke out in cheering and applause. Gorbachev struggled to explain his own
position, but he seemed at a loss.;   Yeltsin, who clearly relished his
emotional and political control of the parliament session, also played a
critical role in selecting the new heads of the KGB, the Defense Ministry and
the Interior Ministry police, which until now have been bastions of opposition
to reform. Flouting protocol, Yeltsin was the first to announce the
appointments while speaking at a mass rally Friday morning outside KGB
headquarters.;   New appointees; Former Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin will
head the KGB, Gen. Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the air force chief, becomes defense
minister and former Russian Interior Minister Victor Barannikov will be the
union's interior minister. All three men took a clear stand against the coup
and are expected to move quickly to reform the key institutions they now
head.;   Gorbachev also fired Alexander Bessmertnykh as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Although Bessmertnykh said he had refused to go along with the coup leaders,
Gorbachev said he had information that his top diplomat had been "maneuvering,
or at least did not take a firm stand.";   Bessmertnykh reacted with
"bitterness," according to the Tass news agency, and claimed that he had
refused to join the conservative uprising, even though coup leader and former
KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov had told him, "We need a liberal among us.";   In
both Moscow and Leningrad, city officials ordered police to seal off Communist
Party headquarters. Moscow Mayor Gavril Popov said investigators had to make a
thorough search of party buildings and documents to determine the scope of the
coup and its participants. Across the country, Communist Party leaders who
opposed the coup quit their party posts, and some who supported it, such as
Latvian party leader Alfred Rubiks, were arrested.;   The leader of the
Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexei II, said the coup meant the end of
communist ideology in the country. "God has saved Russia," he declared.;   As
Gorbachev struggled during the 90-minute session of the Russian parliament, he
called for "maturity and balance" in judging the conspirators and said, "Let's
not have a witch hunt.";   Greeted by protesters; From the moment that
protesters outside the Russian parliament building greeted the arrival of
Gorbachev's limousine with shouts of "Resign! Resign!" it was clear that the
Soviet president was not about to get a warm homecoming from those who played
a key role in rescuing him.;   The Russian deputies - and Yeltsin especially
- were alternately sarcastic and aggressive. When Gorbachev had trouble at
one point explaining one development in the coup, Yeltsin broke in like an
exasperated schoolmaster. "Sometimes Mikhail Sergeyevich forgets things," he
said.;   Yeltsin also seemed eager to impress on Gorbachev just how thoroughly
he had been betrayed by his own ministers and presumed allies. He handed
Gorbachev the minutes of a closed Council of Ministers meeting held last
Monday during which all of the more than 20 ministers present - with one or
two exceptions - supported the coup and the State Committee for the State of
Emergency set up by the putsch leaders.;   "I haven't read this yet," said
Gorbachev in an attempt to put off the matter.;   "Go ahead," Yeltsin
insisted. "Read it now.";   And Gorbachev did, reeling off the names of all of
the ministers who had for so long mouthed the slogans of reform and then
stabbed him in the back.;   "This whole government has got to resign,"
Gorbachev said with a degree of despair in his voice. "I must say this has
been a great drama for me, a severe trial.";   Retribution for Yeltsin;
Yeltsin seemed to take extraordinary relish in this Shakespearean drama of
betrayal and retribution. It had been Gorbachev who ordered Yeltsin out of a
hospital bed in 1987 to face a vengeful meeting of the Moscow Communist Party
Committee. At that session, one speaker after another attacked Yeltsin for
"political immaturity" and other sins for daring to criticize the party and
its Politburo.;   And it was Gorbachev in 1990 who came to the Russian
parliament to call on deputies to vote against Yeltsin as their chairman.
</P>
<P>
Although this seemingly endless political saga of two reformers who can only
struggle to find a common language seemed at an end this spring when they
began negotiations on a new Union Treaty, it is clear that their relationship
will likely remain the great floating opera of Soviet politics.;   Gorbachev
said he and Yeltsin had also agreed to assume each other's duties in an
emergency.;   "If one or another gets in the situation when he cannot even
give orders, like what happened now, his rights and responsibilities are
automatically taken by the other," Gorbachev said.;   It appeared that the
move would have to be temporary and could be made permanent only with
legislative consent. Soviet law makes the vice president the next-in-line.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Yanayev invoked that law in the coup while declaring Gorbachev
physically incapacitated.;   The conspirators themselves are now in jail and
facing interrogation. Gorbachev said the leaders of the junta "tried to turn
us all into chopped meat" and they should be prosecuted without "hesitation or
forgiveness.";   Soviet Prime Minister Valetin Pavlov has been arrested for
helping to lead the coup, Soviet and Russian television reported today.;  
Pavlov was one of the eight officials in the committee that ousted Gorbachev
from power, but he was reportedly taken ill on Sunday night when the coup
began.;   He has been under police guard in a hospital since Gorbachev
regained power Wednesday.;   Speculation of guilt also turned on another key
figure in the old Gorbachev government. According to Yeltsin, Supreme Soviet
Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov has been ousted for taking part in the coup, but
that has not been confirmed.

  WAS GORBACHEV THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE COUP?  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT IS the stuff of a Byzantine Cold War novel, enticing enough to grab the
attention of even the most benign conspiracy theorist: Did Mikhail Gorbachev
orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him?;   The blueprint for imposing
a state of emergency was drawn by Gorbachev himself last winter. He pushed
through the legislation that included suspension of political activity and of
freedom of the press. He hand-picked the heads of the coercive institutions
and other key officials who took part in the coup.  
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev chose to ignore warnings about the right's impending attempt to
seize power. Some warnings came from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as
Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup. But, incredibly, the clearest
signals came from the hard-liners themselves.;   A leading conservative
journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the "nightingale of the General
Staff," published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the
General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and
Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov. With remarkable
candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to
avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union.
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, Baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the Gang of
Eight.;   Gorbachev ignored these warnings.;   To some - an admitted minority
- the thought of a Gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of
the traditional Soviet art of deception known as maskirovka. And to laymen,
something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean
anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power.;   The most volatile
fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from Gorbachev himself, in his
Thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house
arrest in the Crimea.;   Among the questions: If Gorbachev's 32 armed guards
remained loyal to him throughout, why was there no conflict with the
opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup? Why didn't the
coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or at least separate them from
him?;   If Gorbachev's contact with the outside world was limited to
intercepting Western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio, how was he
able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators, down to his
view of their trembling hands?;   It is highly unlikely that the hard-liners
had been set up or ordered by Gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in
order to improve his political standing. Such a scenario would require an
unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to Gorbachev on their part.;   A
more plausible scenario is that Gorbachev was initially a full member of the
conspiracy, which, with his participation, could have clung to the fig leaf of
constitutionality and would have thwarted the new Union Treaty, to have been
signed last Tuesday, which provided for transfer of key levers of power from
the federal presidency to the leaders of republics.;   It is possible that,
unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the
start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the
initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer
residence.;   Gorbachev did reveal, however, that two important officials had
visited him in Crimea at the outset of the coup. One was head of the KGB
department responsible for the security of Soviet leaders; the other was V.
</P>
<P>
Boldin, Gorbachev's closest aide, by the president's own admission a man of
absolute loyalty to him. One can't help but wonder whether these two visitors
came to deliver an ultimatum to Gorbachev and put him under arrest in the
event of his non-compliance, or to deliver important documents from fellow
junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise.;   Conspiracy theorists
grope for motives - Gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal elements in his
government, to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a
treaty that would have lessened his powers. But there is virtually unanimous
agreement on one point. Gorbachev put into power the very hard-liners who
fronted the coup and kept them in power despite their vocal mutterings about
him.
