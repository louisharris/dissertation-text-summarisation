Hurricane Gilbert Heads Toward Dominican Coast
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Gilbert swept
toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted
its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy
rains and high seas.
</P>
<P>
The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustained
winds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph.
``There is no need for alarm,'' Civil Defense Director Eugenio
Cabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closely
follow Gilbert's movement. An estimated 100,000 people live in the
province, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 miles
west of Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and
strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The National
Hurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday at
latitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south of
Ponce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said
Gilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a ``broad area of
cloudiness and heavy weather'' rotating around the center of the
storm.
</P>
<P>
The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastal
flooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to Puerto
Rico's south coast. There were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gusts
Saturday, but they subsided during the night.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical
storm and its remnants pushed inland from the U.S. Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mph
winds and sheets of rain.
</P>
<P>
Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic storm
season, was the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimal
hurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast last
month.

Killer Hurricane Roars Toward Mexico With 175 mph Winds
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gilbert, an ``extremely dangerous hurricane'' and one of the
strongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds after battering the Dominican
Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane killed at least five people Sunday in the
Dominican Republic, civil defense officials said. Six people died
and 60,000 were left homeless in Jamaica on Monday, officials there
said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Edward Seaga said the hurricane swept the full
length of Jamaica, ``leaving a trail of wreckage behind it.''
``It will take us some time before we can assess the full damage
without any doubt,'' Seaga said in a statement. ``But I have no
doubt that this going to be the worst disaster that we have
experienced in our modern history.''
Communications were down with many storm-ravaged areas and the
death toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage and
casualty reports.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane, traveling westward across the Caribbean Sea, was
upgraded Tuesday to a Category 5, the strongest and deadliest type
of hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than
155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
</P>
<P>
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla., described Gilbert as ``a great hurricane ... in the
top 10 percent (historically) as far as intensity, size and
destructive potential.''
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ a
1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida, and Hurricane
Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed
256 people.
``The people who need to be concerned now are those people over
on the Yucatan Peninsula _ Cancun, Cozumel, that whole area,''
Sheets said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's news media reported beachfront hotels were evacuated in
the Yucatan resorts of Cancun and Cozumel Island.
</P>
<P>
They gave no figures on the numer of evacuees, but said people
in Cancun were being sent from the hotel zone into the city center,
about 6 miles away.
</P>
<P>
Cozumel is south of Cancun and the reports said hotel guests
also were being moved to more secure areas away from the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials expected the storm to hit in the early morning
hours Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At midnight EDT the U.S. National Weather Service said Gilbert
was centered near latitude 19.9 north, longitude 84.8 west, or
about 150 miles east-southeast of Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
It said Gilbert was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph with
maximum sustained winds of 175 mph. The center said tropical
storm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles to the north and
200 miles to the south of the center.
``People in the warned areas should have completed all possible
preparations for this extremely dangerous hurricane,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
The center said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm on
record in terms of barometric pressure. It said by 8 p.m. EDT it
was measured at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded
for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western
Hemisphere,'' said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
``There is very serious flooding'' in the Cayman Islands, Erina
Nichols, a tourism official in Miami, said Tuesday after speaking
with residents of the islands. ``The Run Point (community) is
taking a real beating.''
The storm later knocked out all telephone service to the Cayman
Islands, a British dependency of 23,000 people that was expecting
12-foot tides.
</P>
<P>
Warren Chase, an amateur radio operator in Fort Myers, Fla.,
said he received a report of sailboat with seven people aboard
missing near the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the
Gulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
Gene Graves, marketing director for Petroleum Helicopters Inc.
in Lafayette, La., said his company's 18 helipads were working at
full capacity to evacuate about 10,000 oil rigs in the Gulf of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said 40,000 people, many of
them foreign vacationers and students, were evacuated Tuesday from
the Isle of Youth off the southwestern coast as the hurricane
passed 200 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
In New York City, a ham radio operator who was monitoring
amateur radio communications in Jamaica said Tuesday, ``Kingston is
devastated, Montego Bay is hit hard and Ocho Rios is flooded.
</P>
<P>
The operator, Norm Chwat, an officer with the American Red Cross
Radio Club, said therth coast had been wrecked by the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
Herb Schoenbaum, a radio ham operator in the Virgin Islands,
said he spoke Tuesday with Dave Porter, an American staying in the
Wyndham Hotel on Jamaica's Montego Bay. ``Porter reported that the
hotel `peeled apart like a banana' when the force of Hurricane
Gilbert hit last night,'' Schoenbaum said.
``This morning he says there is just nothing left. Boats that
were on the beach, the little rental Sailfishes or Sunfishes, were
driven into cars like spears _ power lines down, almost every tree
in the area is on the ground.''
Schoenbaum said Porter told him people who were trying to enter
the hotel on their hands and knees at the height of the storm were
swept into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Glenn Baxter of Belgrade Lakes, Me., said he spoke with a ham
operator in Jamaica who told him the roof of a hospital in
Mandeville ripped off ``and the hospital has caved in. And that is
the worst horror show that I've heard about because that would
imply that a lot of people could have been hurt.''
The Jamaican consulate in Miami said today it had n immediate
information on the extent of damages or casualties.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica was still out of contact with the rest of the world by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
Roger Myers, southern regional spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Atlanta, said both international
airports in Jamaica are closed. ``We've been told the government
has asked commercial radio stations to remain silent so Radio
Jamaica can broadcast information,'' Myers said.

Gilbert: Third Force 5 Hurricane This Century
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175
miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the most
intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center,
reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric
pressure at Gilbert's center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT on
Tuesday. Gilbert was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western
Hemisphere,'' Zimmer said. The previous record low pressure of
26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck
the Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and
200 miles south of the hurricane's center, Gilbert also was one of
the largest. But because the circumference of a hurricane changes
so often during its course, no records are kept on their overall
size, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to
hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probably
about half that size, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere
since weather officials began keeping detailed records. The others
were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which
bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot
wave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.
</P>
<P>
A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster
in U.S. history, however. That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8
and killed more than 6,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometric
pressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18
feet.
</P>
<P>
The storm surge _ a great dome of water that follows the eye of
the hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path
_ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane center
was forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _
shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs and
windows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed.
``Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane,'' Zimmer
said. ``The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist air
in the center. If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this
warm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, then
you can have a severe hurricane.''
Category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to
155 mph, surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 27.17 to 27.90. The
weakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of
74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more.

Gilbert Slams Into Yucatan Peninsula
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Gilbert battered the resorts of
the Yucatan Peninsula today with 160 mph winds and torrential
rains. Thousands of people fled coastal areas for shelters inland.
``The wind was blowing out windows everywhere'' in Cancun, an
official said of the resort where thousands of Americans vacation
each year.
</P>
<P>
Residents along the gulf coast of Texas, 560 miles to the north,
stockpiled food and supplies and prepared to evacuate. Robert
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Florida, said
early today he expects Gilbert to make landfall on the
Texas-Louisiana coast in 48 to 60 hours.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane, one of the strongest in history, is ``extremely
dangerous,'' the U.S. National Weather Service said. The storm's
winds reached 175 mph earlier today, but later fell slightly to 160
mph, the weather service said.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the
Gulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, which has killed at least 11 people, moved over the
island of Cozumel at 10 a.m. EDT, said Jose Pereira, a spokesman
for the governor's office in Merida, capital of Yucatan state.
</P>
<P>
Pereira, who spoke by telephone from Mexico City, said heavy
rain was falling over the peninsula and communications with Cancun
and Cozumel were out. Cancun is 240 miles east of Medira. Cozumel
is 12 miles off the Yucatan coast.
</P>
<P>
Military and civilian teams evacuated more than 16,000 people
from coastal areas on the upper Yucatan coast between Puerto
Progreso to Rio Lagartos, Pereira said. Most are in shelters in
inland towns, he said.
``Many people were reluctant to leave their homes,'' Pereira
said. ``They had to be convinced of the seriousness of the threat.''
Officials in Merida last spoke with people in Cancun early today
before the center of the storm hit.
``Electricity is down,'' he said. ``We talked to them early in
the morning and they said it was impressive _ all dark. The people
were afraid. The wind was blowing out windows everywhere.''
Heavy rains began in Merida about 6 a.m. EDT, and the storm was
expected to dump 5 to 10 inches on the area.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service in Miami said the eye of the storm
was over northeast Yucatan at noon EDT. The center of the storm was
located near latitude 20.7 north and longitude 87.3 west, or about
150 miles east of Merida. The hurricane was moving toward the west
northwest at 15 mph.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert pounded the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the
low-lying Cayman Islands Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. At least 11
people were reported killed, and at least 60,000 were left homeless
in Jamaica. Rescue teams worked desperately to restore utilities
and communications in the shattered areas.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call early today, receptionist Pablo Torres of
the Carrillos Hotel in Cancun said about 150 people, most of them
tourists, were crowded in the lobby on sofas and chairs.
``We are full, and there is not one tourist now in the beach
hotel zone,'' he said. ``The sound of the wind outside is horrible.
</P>
<P>
You couldn't leave even if you wanted to.''
He said the winds felled utility poles and trees and that sheets
of rain were hitting the city.
</P>
<P>
Jennie Valdez, a representative of the U.S. Consul, said she did
not know how many tourists were in Cancun, but that government
figures estimate between 40,000 and 65,000 a month. Cancun has a
population of about 100,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
High winds also were reported in Valladolid, a city of 80,000
located 80 miles southwest of Cancun, said Jose Joaquin Martil,
local Red Cross president.
</P>
<P>
Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga said late Tuesday that at
least six people were killed, and an estimated 60,000 were left
homeless in ``the worst natural disaster in the modern history of
Jamaica.''
Civil defense officials in the Dominican Republic, sideswiped
Sunday by the storm, reported five people were known dead.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on
record in terms of barometric pressure. It was measured at 26.31
inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane
that devastated the Florida Keys.
``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western
Hemisphere,'' said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert is a Category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type
of hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than
155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
</P>
<P>
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the
1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille
that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.

After Battering Yucatan, Gilbert Strengthens, Heads For Gulf Coast
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most intense hurricane on record
surged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsula
with 160 mph winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts and
forcing tens of thousands to flee.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans
homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm
was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward
the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.
</P>
<P>
The storm was headed west northwest, said National Hurricane
Center director Bob Sheets. It was moving at 15 mph and dumping up
to 10 inches of rain.
``The area that we have the most likely possibility that this
hurricane will make landfall is in the northern part of Mexico or
the southeastern, southern part of Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. today, the center of the storm was near latitude 22.3
north and longitude 92.9 west, or about 380 miles southeast of
Brownsville, Texas, the National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
Brownsville was given a 21 percent probability of being hit,
though a hurricane watch was in effect along the entire Texas coast
as well as the northeastern Mexican coast from Tampico.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the storm struck the Carribean, ravaging
Jamaica, the Dominican Repubic, the Cayman Islands and Haiti,
killing at least 19 in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Haiti declared a state of emergency across its southern
peninsula, where at least 10 hurricane-related deaths have been
reported.
</P>
<P>
The storm, about 450 miles wide, hit the Yucatan coast at dawn
Wednesday, thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees,
knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephone
lines.
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials reported at least seven injuries. There were
no reports of deaths.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert battered the provincial capital of Merida and the gulf
port cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen,
closing airports and roads and knocking out communications and
power and innundating streets and highways.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso and
other coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in
Mexico City said by telephone today. Hundreds of homes were
destroyed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the storm seriously damaged the luxury hotel
zone in the resort of Cancun and destroyed about a quarter of the
homes on the nearby island of Cozumel. Ham radio operators in
Mexico City also told The Associated Press they had reports of
massive damage to several hotels.
</P>
<P>
Authorities were particularly concerned about the people trapped
on another resort island just off Cancun, tiny Isla Mujeres.
</P>
<P>
A navy spokesman in Mexico City said he had no word on the
plight of an estimated 15,000 people stranded there. Three ferries
linking the island with the mainland were lost in the storm, but
there were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
In Campeche, boats were driven onto the street running along the
waterfront, Ramon Castillo, a night watchman at the newspaper
Novedades of Campeche, said in a telephone interview.
``There is no light, there is no radio, there is nothing. There
is much damage. The whole city is flooded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Sheets said the hurricane was expected to hit land midday Friday
and that its sustained winds would today ``certainly increase to
130, 140 miles per hour.''
``It's going to have an impact over a fairly large area,''
Sheets said on CBS-TV's ``This Morning.''
``Those major destructive winds are going to be in there fairly
tight close to the center. But the impacts are going to be felt
over most of the Texas area.''
The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on
record in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured at 26.31
inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane
that devastated the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
In the Yucatan state capital of Merida, the storm's 160 mph
winds destroyed nearly all the thatched houses in one district,
uprooted trees, road signs and cut off water supplies, said
Gonzalez Correa, news editor of Novedades.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman with the National Civil Defense System in Mexico
City said at least 20,000 people had flocked to Merida from coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
Civil defense officials said 6,000 tourists left beachside
motels and 30,000 local people also sought temporary shelter. U.S.
consular officials said they did not know how many tourists were in
Cancun, which receives about 50,000 visitors per month.
</P>
<P>
The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appeared
to have hit Jamaica the hardest. That island nation's prime
minister, Edward Seaga, said Wednesday that it destroyed about
100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes. He estimated damage at $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm,
the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have
maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause
catastrophic damage.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded it
to a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by this morning.
</P>
<P>
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the
1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille,
which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256
people.

Thousands of coastal residents from
Mexico to Louisiana fled to higher ground Thursday as fierce
Hurricane Gilbert sent the first of its storms against Texas after
thrashing the Yucatan Peninsula.
``This is a killer storm,'' said Gordon Guthrie, director of the
Florida Division of Emergency of Management. ``I feel sorry for
anybody wherever this hits.''
The death toll from the storm's onslaught through the Caribbean
islands and the Yucatan was at least 47, and damage estimates
reached $8 billion. Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga declared a
one-month public emergency.
</P>
<P>
By late evening, a torrential rain was falling in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
At 11 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 22.8 north,
longitude 94.4 west, or about 275 miles southeast of Brownsville,
moving west-northwest between 12 and 15 mph, with maximum sustained
winds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 5- to 10-inch rainfall,
according to the National Weather Service.
``If this motion continues, the center of the hurricane will
cross the coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Friday evening,''
the weather service said. ``If a northwest turn should occur, the
landfall could be further up the Texas coast.''
The weather service issued a hurricane warning for Mexico's
northern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile Texas coast
from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, including 250,000-resident
Corpus Christi. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the
remainder of the Texas coast, from Port O'Connor north to Port
Arthur near the Louisiana border.
</P>
<P>
The weather service said warnings might be extended northward,
depending on the path of the 450-mile wide storm.
</P>
<P>
Texas Gov. Bill Clements sent National Guard units to Alice,
McAllen and Corpus Christi, the first such deployment for the
hurricane, to assist in communications and rescue duties.
</P>
<P>
Clements also issued an emergency proclamation allowing local
authorities to suspend laws ``to preserve the health, safety and
welfare of the public,'' including such things as the direction of
travel on highways.
</P>
<P>
Grocery stores ran low on bottled water, batteries, canned tuna
and bread as people laid in supplies. Homeowners covered windows
and doors with plywood and shatter-proofing hurricane tape.
</P>
<P>
Offshore oil workers left their rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
On Galveston Island, City Manager Doug Matthews recommended
Thursday evening that the city's 62,000 residents start evacuating.
``We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock we
are recommending evacuation of the island. We feel that we cannot
wait until the morning to make that decision,'' Matthews said,
adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45
to limit access to the island.
</P>
<P>
In Brownsville, Texas' southernmost city, winds began to pick up
around noon under overcast skies. Police said they were asking
residents to consider evacuating, but were not ordering it.
``We've never evacuated the city and the point is, where are you
going to move 100,000 people?'' said Sgt. Dean Poos.
</P>
<P>
A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company was
doubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate those
fleeing the storm.
</P>
<P>
Lorena Curry, who has lived in Brownsville since 1935, said she
plans to ride out the storm. ``I've been through them before. I'm
going to stick around at my home.'' But she added, ``I could get
along without a hurricane very well.''
Gilbert surged into the gulf after battering the Yucatan
Peninsula in Mexico with 160 mph winds, forcing tens of thousands
to flee.
</P>
<P>
After crossing the peninsula, Gilbert's winds weakened to 120
mph, but forecasters predicted the storm would intensify again as
it moves over open water.
``The shower and thunderstorm activity that we see taking place
around the hurricane itself is getting better organized, more
vigorous, so we think it's starting to strengthen,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Sheets said the hurricane's sustained winds would ``certainly
increase to 130, 140 miles per hour.''
In the coastal resort of South Padre Island, about 25 miles
southeast of Brownsville, the mayor ordered its 1,000 residents to
evacuate.
``We can't force them to leave, but it doesn't make any sense to
stay,'' said Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr., adding that water and
electricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Tropical storm force winds, at least 39 mph, extended outward up
to 250 miles to the north and 200 miles to the south of the center.
</P>
<P>
The storm's first landfall earlier this week left at least 26
people dead in Jamaica, five in the Dominican Republic, 10 in Haiti
and the six in Mexico. It also left a half-million people homeless
in Jamaica and caused widespread damage to the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
The storm barreled into the Yucatan coast at dawn Wednesday,
thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees, knocking out
electricity and water supplies and severing telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
In Campeche, the state capital on the peninusula's west coast,
boats and seaweed littered the streets of hundreds of yards from
the shore after Gilbert passed through.
``The whole city is flooded. Everything is dark,'' said Ramon
Castillo, a watchman at the newspaper Novedades de Campeche. ``I've
lived here all my life and I have never seen bad weather like this.
</P>
<P>
People are scared.''
Mexican officials reported six deaths, including two babies who
drowned, and at least seven people were injured, but authorities
were unable to reach many isolated villages.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert pounded the provincial capital of Merida and the gulf
port cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen,
closing airports and roads and knocking out communications and
power and flooding streets and highways.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso and
other coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in
Mexico City said by telephone Thursday. Hundreds of homes were
destroyed, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Mexico's northern coast, people were evacuated from fishing
villages and towns into shelters in Matamoros, a city of 400,000
about 12 miles inland near Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane center said Gilbert at one point was the most
intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, which was
measured Tuesday at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches
recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appeared
to have hit Jamaica the hardest. Seaga said it destroyed about
100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes. He estimated damage at $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
Seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast Thursday that the
one-month ``period of public emergency,'' including a dawn-to-dusk
curfew to prevent looting, was put into effect ``to enable normalcy
to resume in the shortest possible time and to allow the rebuilding
process to begin.''
On Wednesday, Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm, the
strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have maximum
sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic
damage.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded it
to a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by Thursday morning.

<P>
Hurricane Gilbert weakened to a
tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw
tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees
along the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 left
homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mph
wind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulf
of Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico. One person died
today in Texas after being injured in a tornado.
</P>
<P>
But by this morning, the once massive storm's maximum sustained
winds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, and
forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared. However, they
warned of continued danger from flash flooding inland.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as it
proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northern
Mexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Winds were still weakening as the storm moved west-northwest at
12 mph, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Coast residents expressed relief that the storm, which
earlier was deemed the most powerful ever tracked in the Western
Hemisphere, pulled its punch as it came ashore despite delivering a
spate of tornadoes.
``We're thankful,'' said Betty Turner, mayor of Corpus Christi.
``What could have been one of the most deadly storms in history
appears to have missed us.''
Corpus Christi residents who evacuated were eager to return, but
Turner said, ``We're saying don't do it because of the flooding.''
At least a dozen tornadoes peppered southern Texas today,
following 14 on Friday, killing one woman, striking a hospital
complex, military bases and a mobile home park, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Some injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
At 6 a.m. CDT, the center of the storm was in northern Mexico
near latitude 25.0 degrees north and longitude 99.8 west, or about
150 miles southwest of Brownsville, located at the southernmost tip
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grande
valley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as a
``huge rain-making machine,'' said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
``The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great,'' Zimmer
said. ``Rainfall as high as 10 to 15 inches _ maybe even 20 inches
_ is expected.''
By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valley
and end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather,
forecasters said.
``The people in the Midwest better dust off their umbrellas,''
Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, responsible for billions of dollars in damage during a
weeklong rampage across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, barreled
ashore Friday afternoon in Tamaulipas state, a sparsely populated
area of Mexico about 120 miles south of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
The eye passed over Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, two small
villages a few miles north of La Pesca, Mexico, where ocean tides
coursed over two miles of flatlands and into the town.
``We presume (the Mexican villages) are getting a good pounding
from 120 mph winds,'' Zimmer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people evacuated in areas of northeastern Mexico,
including the entire beach area of Matamoros, a city of 280,000
just across the border.
</P>
<P>
To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatan
state and 10,000 more were homeless in Campeche, on the west coast
of the peninsula, the government news agency Notimex said. The
storm had left more than 500,000 homeless in Jamaica earlier in the
week.
</P>
<P>
In Texas, heavy rains fell on Brownsville, with gusts up to 82
mph recorded at nearby Padre Island, but the vulnerable coastal
area escaped the worst of the storm.
</P>
<P>
Police in nearby Harlingen said the windows of 20 to 30 cars in
a parking lot were shattered by high winds or a tornado. Low-lying
coastal roads were closed by high water.
</P>
<P>
About 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in a
four-county area of southern Texas around Brownsville, said
American Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman. When the eye of the
storm passed to the south, evacuees were eager to return to their
homes.
``We're going home. We think everything is going to be OK,''
Philip Gibbons said Friday night, leaving a Brownsville shelter
into a downpour. ``We don't think it's going to get bad and there
was no need to stay here anymore.''
Others, however, were more cautious.
``I wouldn't want to go home and then have my family hurt by a
tornado,'' said Praxedis Lindsey, 25, of Brownsville, who was at a
shelter with his pregnant wife and son.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, most of the estimated 25,000 people evacuated in
southern Louisiana and 20,000 in the island city of Galveston were
allowed to return home Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, tornadoes were reported in seven counties, uprooting
trees but causing no major damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
One Texas drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane. A
3-year-old boy fell from his family's shrimp boat when they moved
the vessel for safe mooring, officials said.

<P>
Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a
river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10
policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with
evacuees from Matamoros, police said today.
</P>
<P>
The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3
million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140
miles inland from Matamoros.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 police officers were swept away while on a rescue
mission around midnight, a judicial police officer said. Several
buses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and more
were feared drowned.
</P>
<P>
The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early
today it had been raining for more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
A trailer truck also slid into the Santa Catarina river in the
driving rain and its two occupants were missing, the local
newspaper El Norte said.
</P>
<P>
Recreational areas with soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis
courts and jogging trails have been built along the river in the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
Monterrey is a major northern industrial center and the capital
of Nuevo Leon state. The Santa Catarina river crosses Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
The storm slammed into Mexico for the second time in a week
Friday afternoon. The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mph
winds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in a
sparsely populated area 120 miles south of Brownsville, Texas,
weather reports said.
</P>
<P>
Although the storm had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods
and mudslides after it barreled into Mexico. Earlier in the week,
Gilbert killed at least 29 and left 300,000 people homeless in the
Yucatan Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane has killed at least 109 people, including one in
Texas, 39 in Mexico, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in the
Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras. However, the death toll
is expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
In Matamoros just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, the
storm felled trees, downed power lines and flattened dozens of tin
shack homes on the evacuated beachfront. About 5,000 people were
evacuated inland.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
Much of the Yucatan Peninsula remained without communications and
supplies today.
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m. EDT today, Gilbert's center was located near latitude
25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest of
Brownsville and 40 miles south of Monterrey, said the National
Hurricane Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and the
storm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying the
storm with up to 20 inches locally. Flash floods were likely, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was
expected to follow that track through midday today before turning
gradually to the northwest, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
In Matamoros, officials said the worst part of the storm
appeared to have passed. ``Up to now the damages are not considered
very grave,'' said Jose Inez Gonzalez, a Matamoros government
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Officials distributed crackers and water to thousands of people
in shelters and rged them to stay put until the storm ended.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert hit Soto la Marina, a town of 8,000 people 20 miles
inland from La Pesca on late Friday, its mayor told The Associated
Press by telephone.
``There is considerable material damage to the town. It is still
raining very hard,'' said Mayor Ruben Hinojosa Cortina. ``We will
just have to stay in and wait until tomorrow to survey the
situation.''
Hinojosa Cortina said about 3,000 refugees from La Pesca were
sheltered in Soto la Marina but other coastal residents had not
been evacuated or decided to ride out the storm.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra de Tamaulipas, a small mountain range between
Monterrey and the coast, should blunt the hurricane's strength,
said Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
Zimmer expected the last of hurricane-force winds today. But he
predicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into cooler
mountain air, possibly causing flash floods and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican armed forces began emergency flights Friday of food,
medicines and water to Cancun, Cozumel and other disaster sites in
the Yucatan.
</P>
<P>
In many locations, hurricane victims were without food, drinking
water, electrical power, gasoline and communications since
Wednesday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dominican Republic, all domestic flights and flights to and from Puerto Rico and Miami were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean island they share, and headed west. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still gaining strength. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time," said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. EDT, the center of the hurricane was about 100 miles south of the Dominican Republic and 425 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
The hurricane was moving west at about 15 mph and was expected to continue this motion for the next 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the hurricane's track would take it about 50 miles south of southwestern Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
The hurricane center said small craft in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should remain in port until conditions improve. 
</P>
<P>
The forecasters said the Dominican Republic would get as much as 10 inches of rain yesterday, with similar amounts falling in Haiti last night and tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane warnings were issued for the south coast of Haiti and Cuba by their respective governments. 
</P>
<P>
In Jamaica, the government issued a hurricane watch for the entire island. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
In Puerto Rico, besides tearing off several roofs, the storm caused coastal flooding and brought down power lines and trees along roads and highways in the west and southwestern regions. 
</P>
<P>
Three people were injured in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, when a tree fell on their vehicle as they traveled along Route 97, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Four policemen stationed on Mona Island, between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, were stranded as a result of the weather.
