<P>
A major earthquake rocked northern
California Tuesday evening, collapsing part of the San Francisco
Bay Bridge and shaking Candlestick Park and buildings up to 95
miles away.
</P>
<P>
Some buildings may have collapsed, said Police Officer D.
</P>
<P>
Collins. There were reports of injuries at Candlestick, where fans
were waiting for the World Series to begin, and the stadium was
evacuated, ABC-TV and Cable News Network reported.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which lasted about 15 seconds, measured 6.5 on the
Richter scale, according to seismologists at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The preliminary reading was
from the Alaska Tsunami warning system, Caltech said.
</P>
<P>
Televised footage of the bridge showed that a 30-foot section of
the span's upper deck had collapsed onto the bottom level.
</P>
<P>
Fans at Candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed for about 15
seconds. Players from the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland
Athletics were on the field and stood around as fans began to leave
their seats.
</P>
<P>
Buildings in San Francisco swayed several feet.
</P>
<P>
The quake shook buildings in Sacramento, 95 miles to the
northeast, and was felt as far away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the
east.
</P>
<P>
The quake knocked out phones and power, including electricity at
The Associated Press' bureau in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

<P>
A violent earthquake rocked Northern
California during Tuesday evening's rush hour, caving in a section
of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, terrifying World Series fans in
Candlestick Park and shaking buildings as far as 200 miles away.
</P>
<P>
CBS-TV reported one person had been killed on the bridge. There
were no other immediate confirmed reports of deaths or injuries,
but ABC-TV and CNN both said some people were injured at
Candlestick, where the game was canceled and fans were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how extensive the damage was from
the quake, which struck at 5:04 p.m. PDT and registered 6.9 on the
Richter scale. It was centered near Hollister, 80 miles southeast
of San Francisco in San Benito County.
``The thing struck just as everyone was going home,'' said Tom
Mullins, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency
Services in Sacramento. ``We've got reports coming in from San
Benito and Santa Clara counties of heavy damage.''
</P>
<P>
CBS said the California Highway Patrol reported a J.C. Penney
building in downtown Hollister collapsed and a bridge on Highway
101 in Hollister collapsed.
</P>
<P>
There were unconfirmed reports that a shopping mall collapsed in
San Jose, 50 miles south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Airport was evacuated, and some people there were
hit with falling plaster.
</P>
<P>
One major fire was blazing in San Francisco's Marina District
and another near the library at University of California at
Berkeley. A huge plume of smoke visible for miles over Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people fled Bay Area Rapid Transit subway and
elevated stations in San Francisco and East Bay suburbs. The system
was shut down.
</P>
<P>
Televised footage of the bridge connecting Oakland and San
Francisco showed that a 30-foot section of the upper deck had
collapsed, leaving two cars dangling between the two levels.
</P>
<P>
Reports said most occupants got out of their cars safely.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush said the federal government was
prepared to send help to the earthquake area in California and he
was sending Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner there to assess
the damage.
</P>
<P>
At City Hall in San Francisco a radio reporter told listeners,
``The entire building started to shake ... you could hear people
yelling and screaming all over the building.''
She said there were ``obvious problems'' at the health
department across the street. ``Water was literally gushing out of
the building from a window on the second floor,'' the unidentified
reporter said.
</P>
<P>
Citizens of Marin, north of San Francisco, were warned to shut
off their gas because the smell of gas was all over town.
</P>
<P>
Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said
the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale. It occurred at
5:04 p.m. PDT and was centered in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75
miles south of San Francico on the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
The quake was felt as far away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
The quake knocked out phones and power, including electricity at
The Associated Press bureau in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The San Mateo bridge, which crosses the bay about 10 miles south
of Candlestick Park was closed for inspection.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Police Officer Dwayne Collins said there were
reports that buildings and statues in the historic South of Market
district near downtown had collapsed.
``I thought I was losing my balance, then I saw the lamppost
sway one foot each direction. Then I saw falling glass, broken
glass on the street, but luckily not near me, `` said Les Galvacs
who was walking down Market Street in downtown San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
David Balague, 22, was on the 14th floor of the Bank of America
building. ``I've never been so scared. People were fighting to get
under the desks.''
Fans at Candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed shortly
before the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics were to have
begun the third game of the World Series.
``This upper deck was absolutely shaking, the light stanchions
were blowing back and forth, phones have gone out,'' Suzyn Waldman,
a reporter covering the World Series for WFAN-AM in New York told
listeners shortly after the quake hit. ``Everyone is standing
around here, people in the upper deck absolutely terrified to move
not knowing what to do.''
A man in Saratoga, southwest of San Jose, told a San Francisco
radio station, ``My house is OK, but everything in it is gone. My
refrigerator is standing in the middle of the kitchen.'' He said
10,000 gallons of water from his swimming pool crashed through his
picture window into his home.
</P>
<P>
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake of 6 on the scale can cause severe damage. A 7
reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before
the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the
Richter scale.

Area Where Earthquake Hit Seen as Highly Probable in 1988 Report
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<HEADLINE>
<HL>
With AM-SF Quake
</HL>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The major earthquake that struck the San
Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists
targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
A 1988 report by the U.S. Geological Survey placed the
probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scale
at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.
</P>
<P>
The high probability is based on several factors, including
length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in
1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at
the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.
``This is not to say we predicted the earthquake. It just has to
do with the probability of an earthquake in this area,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the 1988 report, titled ``Probabilities of Large
Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,''
presented information that was already widely known among
scientists. Allen said this information should have alerted
officials to take preventive steps.
</P>
<P>
Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said
the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale. It was centered
in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico.
</P>
<P>
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A reading of 6 can cause severe damage. A quake of 7
magnitude, a ``major'' earthquake, is capable of widespread heavy
damage.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday's
quake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings.
``It's not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a
calamitous event. It's something we should therefore be ready
for,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind of
structures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los
Angeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said.
``I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of view
from this earthquake,'' he said. ``What will be important is to see
how the modern structures behaved.''
Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that
appeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in the
Los Angeles region. In addition, some of the roadways and
overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction
as the Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
In some areas of Southern California, there is a higher
probability of a major quake occurring. The highest, the USGS says,
is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90
percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.

While LA Awaits `The Big One,' Another Killer Quake Hits San Francisco
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San
Francisco, many scientists have believed the next ``big one'' would
strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault.
</P>
<P>
But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it
also faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became a
reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale
rocked the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a
6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the San
Andreas Fault that stretches 50 miles from Palo Alto southward
through the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista.
</P>
<P>
The quake was centered on the San Andreas segment described in
the article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Geological Survey office in Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yet
whether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of Santa
Cruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professor
Christopher Scholz, was among several that produced conflicting
estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally
happened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These studies gave various interpretations of how much stress
inside the Earth was released by the great San Francisco earthquake
of 1906, which had a magnitude of about 8.3 and killed at least
2,500 people.
</P>
<P>
The bigger a quake, the more stress it relieves, and thus the
longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again.
</P>
<P>
Scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve as
much stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains as other scientists
believed. That suggested a bigger quake might happen in the San
Francisco Bay area sooner than some believed.
</P>
<P>
Others disagreed. Faced with conflicting estimates, the
Geological Survey issued a July 1988 report that it said
represented a consensus on the debate.
</P>
<P>
The report said the 50-mile segment had a 20 percent likelihood
of producing a magnitude-7 quake within 30 years. It said the
southernmost 20 miles of that segment had a 30 percent chance of
generating a magnitude-6.5 quake within 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's jolt was centered within those southernmost 20 miles
of the fault segment.
``Clearly, scientists had identified this segment as a
particularly hazardous one,'' Heaton said. ``There was some debate
about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake.''
The last great southern California quake, in 1857, killed very
few people in a region that was then sparsely populated.
</P>
<P>
Thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not the Bay Area, would fall
victim to the next seismic catastrophe; the 1988 USGS report cast
doubt on this assumption.
</P>
<P>
Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next ``big
one'' _ a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake _ could kill
3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000
people in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
As bad as Tuesday's quake was, ``it was not a 1906 earthquake,''
Geological Survey director Dalas Peck said.
``The question is not whether a big earthquake is coming. The
question is when,'' Peck said.

Relief Pours Into Bay Area
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Private groups and officials from Tokyo to London to Charleston,
S.C., offered help to the ruptured San Francisco Bay area, but some
said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained
by previous disasters.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, long San Francisco's West Coast competitor but
equally at the mercy of the San Andreas Fault, quickly shipped
doctors, sonic equipment and fire investigators to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of a sister city in disaster, Charleston's Joseph P.
</P>
<P>
Riley Jr., sent a plane load of drinking water, a symbolic return
of the support his city got after Hugo.
``I know we still have and will have great needs here and
charity certainly begins at home,'' Riley said. ``However, it would
be wrong for this community ... not to reach in (our pockets) and
contribute to those who are hurt and suffering right now.''
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos has estimated damage $2 billion in
his city alone.
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army had the food cooking almost before the earth
quit shaking in Northern California, while the Red Cross opened the
doors and unfolded cots in 25 shelters.
``We don't wait for anybody,'' said Col. Leon Ferraez,
communications director of the Salvation Army. ``We're there the
minute the news is on.''
According to Ferraez, the organization dispatched 12 mobile
canteens to the hardest-hit earthquake areas within minutes. All
Salvation Army centers in the Bay Area, including 34 community
service centers and scores of other units, have been turned over to
the relief effort.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles donated sonic equipment to help detect sounds of
people trapped in rubble. And officials in Los Alamos, N.M.,
dispatched a device used to locate survivors of last year's
Armenian quake.
</P>
<P>
Israel offered the services of a special army rescue squad that
also helped dig out victims in Armenia. A French disaster relief
agency offered to send special teams of searchers.
</P>
<P>
A team of British engineers were to fly to San Francisco today
to help assess structural damage from the quake.
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area has a large Asian population, and callers from
Japan and the Philippines and other countries jammed phone lines
trying to reach relatives.
</P>
<P>
The Osaka, Japan, city government announced it was sending
$10,000 to San Francisco, a sister city since 1957.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley sent police and fire investigators
to assess damage from the quake, and convened his own emergency
council in a special meeting to discuss other possible measures.
``I am joining millions of Californians as we intensely watch
the damage of the large San Francisco earthquake,'' said Bradley.
``We all know the horrors of an earthquake and we express our
deep-felt sympathy for the people of the San Francisco Bay area.''
An Anheuser-Busch Inc. brewery in Fairfield, 35 miles northeast
of San Francisco, interrupted normal operations to fill cans with
drinking water instead of beer for free shipment to relief
agencies, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard offices across the West Coast provided San Francisco
with as many boats and helicopters as could be spared, said Coast
Guard spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross sent 290 units of blood from Los Angeles; the San
Diego Blood Bank rushed 50 units to San Francisco within an hour of
the quake; more than 400 units were sent from Portland, Ore.
``Giving makes them feel good,'' said Trudy Sullivan, a Red
Cross spokeswoman in Portland.
</P>
<P>
Even the Internal Revenue Service got into the act, announcing
it would waive penalties for taxpayers unable to file returns or
make scheduled payments because of the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
President Bush directed $273 million in immediate aid for quake
victims and said he would visit the area Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But some officials said the disaster could strain the coffers of
private agencies and those of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which was criticized for its response to the storm-lashed
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross began its fiscal year July 1 with $18.5 million in
its disaster budget, and had spent 40 percent by September. Then
Hugo came along, triggering an effort the agency estimates will
cost $42 million _ the most ever.
``When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit
back-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disaster
resources and manpower,'' said Bob Vessey, director of disaster
services in Washington, D.C.

SCIENTISTS LAST YEAR HAD PINPOINTED TUESDAY'S SITE AS LIKELY TO BE JOLTED 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San 
Francisco quake on April 18, 1906, came in a place that had been identified by 
scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern 
California within the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa 
Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes 
in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27, 1988, and Aug. 8, 1989. A 
6.5-magnitude quake was centered there in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey, in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake 
probability in California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude 
earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San 
Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern 
California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as 
the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area 
marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during 
this time, scientists said Tuesday night, pressure was probably building up in 
the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as 
much. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Heaton, the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency's 
Pasadena field office, said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen 
as "preshocks" of the Tuesday's 6.9 temblor. He said "foreshocks" would not be 
the proper term, since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton said that a still larger shock is unlikely. But he joined Caltech 
scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 5.9 magnitude should be 
expected, and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months. A 5.9 
aftershock would be as strong as the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains, the 
state Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Geological Survey issued 
warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes, ranging up to 6.5 magnitude, 
within the next few days in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
But these warnings said that if nothing happened, then the chances of a major 
earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity. The trouble was, the area 
was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on 
the San Andreas Fault. Only the nearby Hayward fault may harbor as great a 
danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The San Andreas, the longest and best-known earthquake fault in California, 
extends from Point Arena in Mendocino County to the Salton Sea. It has been the 
site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the state's recorded 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tuesday's quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National 
Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 
magnitude, it should be considered only a "strong" shock, not a "major" one, as 
a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a "great" one, as a 
quake of 8.0 or above would be. 
</P>
<P>
Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the 
probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in 
Southern California sometime in the next three decades. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it was, Tuesday's quake was about four times stronger than the 
devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than 
the 1987 Whittier quake. Each point of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase 
in the power of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Person said that, like most San Andreas earthquakes, this was most likely to be 
a strike-slip quake, with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past 
another. But he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection 
teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the Geological 
Survey's Menlo Park office. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dewey, a research geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center, said 
preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep, 
and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from 
the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around Santa Cruz, although 
this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations, as will a final 
confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen 
nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but 
several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just 
east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may 
have been a precursor, or somehow added pressure, on the San Andreas. But when 
a 5.1 earthquake did strike on the Calaveras in 1988, some earthquake 
scientists expressed concern that this could be the case. 
</P>
<P>
Between the late 1950s and 1979, there were no quakes of magnitude 5 or larger 
near the Bay Area. But in August, 1979, a 6.4-magnitude quake struck under 
Coyote Lake east of Gilroy and south of San Jose, and since then there have 
been a number of quakes. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Geological Survey scientists had expressed concern at the step-up in 
5-magnitude quakes south of the Bay Area. They noted that a similar series of 
moderately strong quakes had preceded the San Francisco quake of 1906. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a New Mexico scientist who studies tidal forces, supported by two 
eyewitnesses, said Tuesday night that at a private lecture in San Francisco on 
Oct. 10, he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or 
about Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Iben Browning, of Sandia Park, N. M., said he had based his prediction on an 
assessment of tidal forces caused by the moon's relationship with the Earth. He 
said he had decided to keep the assessment private because he feared that 
publicity about it would cause people to panic. 
</P>

<P>
There are events one never forgets. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was 
assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World 
Series will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when 
the earthquake hit. It was shortly after the network went on the air. 
</P>
<P>
My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I 
knew what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, 
mainly because I was awake this time. 
</P>
<P>
I opened the door to the trailer and looked out. The stadium was shaking and 
the special concrete joint - one of several strategically spaced around the 
top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage - was doing was it was 
designed to do. It was opening and closing as if the place was made of 
cardboard instead of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be 
great alarm, because the quake did not last long. 
</P>
<P>
I walked into the stadium to interview fans. And again, I sensed little panic. 
</P>
<P>
Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
And later, when fans started leaving en masse, the reaction of those I talked 
to varied. Those who were sitting in the upper deck seemed considerably more 
shaken than those in the lower levels. LARRY STEWART

<P>
On Telegraph Hill, Jerry Lubenow got his biggest shock when he arrived at his 
apartment after the deadly earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no damage to our place or in our neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing Lubenow could figure out was that "Telegraph Hill is on rock." 
He then talked to friends who live on Nob Hill and Russian Hill, which are also 
situated on rock, and learned that their residences also avoided damage. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost feel guilty," he said, referring to his own good fortune. "(It's) 
like living through the blitz in London in the Second World War." 
</P>
<P>
Only a few miles away in San Francisco's affluent Marina District, dozens of 
fashionable townhouses were damaged or destroyed. Some buckled and pitched 
forward off their foundations into the street. Others appeared outwardly sound 
but sustained interior damage that rendered them uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
Why did some of the luxury, four-story apartment buildings collapse at the 
Marina while in nearby Chinatown, shops made of unreinforced masonry sustained 
little damage in the 6.9 temblor? 
</P>
<P>
Why did high-rises that form the elegant San Francisco skyline escape virtually 
unscathed while an office building in the city's southeast district peel apart, 
killing five pedestrians below? 
</P>
<P>
"The buildings that collapsed did so because of a combination of two things: 
very poor soil and very poor structural design," said Peter I. Yanev, chairman 
of EQE Engineering Inc., a structural engineering firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"They were on top of the worst soil conditions in the city," explained Yanev, 
who said he has traveled to "all the major earthquakes" in the last 20 years 
studying their impact on construction. 
</P>
<P>
The soil beneath the Marina District, where six buildings burned down or 
collapsed, is made up of landfill partly dredged from the bay more than 70 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yanev said many of the buildings in the neighborhood were erected in the early 
part of this century when there were no earthquake codes. 
</P>
<P>
"What collapsed and killed some people were four-story apartment buildings that 
had garages built all the way along the bottom (floor)," Yanev said. "So, you 
have a bunch of garages underneath all these apartments. You effectively have 
no walls on one side of the building. The connections just break, and the front 
end falls into the street." 
</P>
<P>
Yanev called the two conditions a "disaster waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"Should we have an earthquake centered off the Golden Gate Bridge instead of 
Santa Cruz, you'd probably have hundreds of these buildings collapse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said they did not anticipate that the Marina District would be the 
major problem in an earthquake. The worst areas, they believed, would be 
Chinatown and the Tenderloin, where brick buildings abound. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown survived relatively intact, Yanev said, because it is located "up in 
the hills" atop "very firm soil," and the epicenter of the temblor was many 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
In the city's high-rise office towers, a few broken windows and other cosmetic 
damage could be seen. A preliminary survey found only three skyscrapers 
rendered unsafe by the quake. But most buildings, including the landmark 
Transamerica Pyramid, were not touched. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Cahill, an owner of Cahill Construction Co., a contractor that built 
several high-rises in the city, said the earthquake codes "did their job." 
</P>
<P>
"What this quake proves is that the engineers were right" when they said tall 
buildings could withstand a strong quake, he said. They said the downtown 
buildings are constructed to withstand a quake of at least 8 magnitude with an 
epicenter in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake experts said they were not surprised that the high-rises swayed with 
the earthquake while four-story buildings collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"An earthquake means that the ground shakes, and that means force is applied to 
the sides of buildings," said George C. Lee, acting director of the National 
Center for Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
When architects design skyscrapers, Lee said, they factor in wind gusts and 
earth movement - forces that are not considered as much when constructing 
smaller buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In smaller buildings, he said, contractors usually make sure that vertical 
forces - such as snow and ice - cannot force a structure to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Bay Area, residents were left to puzzle over why the earthquake 
savaged some buildings and bypassed others, much like San Francisco was left to 
wonder why the Marina District was hard hit and others spared. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz, initial damages were estimated at $350 million, and 30% of the 
downtown mall - the heart of the city - was severely damaged. An estimated 20 
commercial buildings must be razed, a county official said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Gatos, 30 miles northeast of Santa Cruz, portions of the downtown area 
were destroyed. Several dozen Victorian homes were shifted off their 
foundations, and numerous chimneys crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco fire officials said as many as 60 buildings in the Marina 
District may have to be torn down because of structural instability caused by 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the buildings are extremely hazardous," Assistant Fire Chief Frank 
Blackburn said. "They are four-story buildings above garages. All they had were 
vertical columns holding up the structures. If you picture a building sitting 
on columns with no lateral support on those columns, when you get sideways 
motion, the buildings slide left and right." 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn said many residents are not going to be able to get their belongings 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"If a (big) aftershock comes, it'll collapse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings collapsed like cakes without yeast. One fourth-floor apartment 
dweller stepped through her window onto the street after her building crumbled 
beneath her.

BAY AREA QUAKE; 
SISTER CITIES IN THE ANNALS OF NATURAL DISASTERS; 
HISTORY: CHARLESTON AND SAN FRANCISCO ARE ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE COUNTRY, BUT 
A HURRICANE AND A QUAKE BRING THEM TOGETHER IN TIME'S LEDGER. 
</HL>

<DATELINE>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although they are a continent apart, the cities of Charleston, S.C., and San 
Francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time. They are the scenes 
of two of the century's costliest, back-to-back natural disasters: Hurricane 
Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
There are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two 
cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by 
two powerful forces of nature - one that angrily swept across the land from 
the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth. 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint of compassion, of all the people in America we can feel 
the hurt that the San Francisco area is going through the most," Charleston 
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Sunday, one month after Hugo hit. "We know it 
means, at best, the disruption of normal life for some time and, at worst, the 
loss of life." 
</P>
<P>
Charleston had warning. San Francisco did not. Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes 
can be tracked by planes and radar, their paths predicted with sufficient 
certainty for those in harm's way to secure property and to flee. Still, at 
least 28 deaths in the Carolinas are blamed on Hugo, while at least 60 deaths 
have been attributed to the Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo, 500 miles across with winds topping 175 m.p.h., left virtually every 
street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and 80% of the city's 
buildings with some degree of damage. Five days after the storm, many city 
residents remained inconvenienced, most without electricity, many without safe 
drinking water. Street lights didn't work. Broken glass and other debris left 
the roadsides lined with cars stopped by flat tires. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast the streets in most of San Francisco were passable within a day of 
the earthquake. Electricity was largely restored overnight. And most broken 
natural gas lines were quickly repaired. Restaurants in Chinatown, North Beach 
and along Fillmore Street were crowded Saturday night. Cable cars began 
carrying passengers Sunday and the curtain went up on the opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Their streets were immediately passable," said Charleston Police Chief Ruben 
Greenberg. "We were gridlocked for two days because of the debris." 
</P>
<P>
And a week after the hurricane, Charleston - which like San Francisco has a 
tourism-based economy - was still trying to cope with mountains of broken 
trees and shattered roofs. It was more than 10 days before restaurants and 
other stores began to slowly reopen and twice as long for night life to begin 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
Tour Buses Return 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, tourists and tour buses could be seen outside hotels near 
Fisherman's Wharf and at other locations favored by visitors. Tourism is a 
$2.5-billion-a-year business in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
It took almost three weeks for businesses that cater to tourists to get back on 
their feet in Charleston. It's likely to take a lot longer for the tourists 
themselves to return in numbers that made it one of the city's biggest 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
Citywide, Charleston had 68 buildings collapse, compared to 60 buildings 
destroyed just in San Francisco's Marina District. 
</P>
<P>
In Charleston most of the damage could be quickly assessed. It was visible. In 
San Francisco much of the damage may still be undetected. Water mains and gas 
lines weakened by the heaving earth may not break for weeks or months. 
Structural damage to houses, in many instances, will become apparent over a 
long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"When a hurricane is over, it's over," Greenberg said. "Not so with an 
earthquake. You have aftershocks." 
</P>
<P>
Charleston also escaped widespread damage to its infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost no major economic area like the Bay Bridge," said Greenberg, who was 
once San Francisco's undersheriff and who returned with emergency supplies to 
help the Santa Cruz police. "That's an economic lifeline. All we lost was one 
minor bridge. They're going to have humongous traffic problems." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo left Charleston isolated from the world. Communications broke down soon 
after the storm crossed the coastline about midnight and it was daybreak before 
the nation began to learn of the widespread damage. Even local residents were 
left without any information. The hurricane knocked out all local television 
and radio stations, and local officials for almost two days depended on a 
Florida radio station to deliver vital information and warnings. 
</P>
<P>
Millions were watching the pregame World Series program when the earthquake 
struck, and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster. San 
Francisco stations were able to broadcast to residents who had battery-powered 
radios and TVs. 
</P>
<P>
Damage estimates from Hugo have ranged as high as $5 billion, while earthquake 
damage estimates Sunday reached the $6.6 billion mark. 
</P>
<P>
Besides that black page in the ledger of history, both San Francisco and 
Charleston also have another experience in common: Both have experienced 
frustrating delays in getting disaster relief from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, who has now watched the federal government respond to two of 
America's worst disasters, said he sees relatively few differences between how 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency worked in South Carolina and Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that needs to be done in a hurry with them," he said. "They 
just plop along like one of the horses at Disneyland. Just plop, plop, plop. 
They are repeating the mistakes of South Carolina in California."
