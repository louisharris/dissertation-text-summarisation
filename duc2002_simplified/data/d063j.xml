An explosion rocked the Royal Marines School of
Music in a southeastern coastal town today, causing one building to
collapse and killing eight people, officials said. Thirty people
were injured and up to 18 were missing and feared trapped in the
rubble.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks
near Deal, about 70 miles southeast of London, the Defense Ministry
said.
``The building has collapsed,'' said a ministry spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
``We've no idea of the cause of the blast at the moment. It is
too early to tell.''
Scotland Yard said a forensic team from its anti-terrorist squad
had been called in to help investigate.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to
search for those trapped in the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade
spokesman Kevin Simmons.
</P>
<P>
Kent police said 17 or 18 people were trapped. The Defense
Ministry said seven were missing.
</P>
<P>
Ten doctors gave emergency treatment at the scene and 11
ambulances took the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance service
said.
``They are suffering from flash burns to their head and arms,
fractures, and the sort of injuries you would expect after an
explosion,'' said a spokesman for Buckland Hospital in Dover, 20
miles south of Deal.
</P>
<P>
South Eastern British Gas sent investigators to the scene but
said there was nothing to indicate the explosion was caused by a gas
leak. Gas supplies to the barracks were cut as a precautionary
measure, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Guy Platts, who owns a bookstore in Deal, located 20 miles north
of the English Channel port of Dover, said he heard a ``massive
explosion. ... There are dozens of ambulances, police and fire
brigade making their way there.''
Military targets on the British mainland have been attacked
several times by the Irish Republican Army in the past year as part
of its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
</P>
<P>
One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA attack on an
army barracks in north London in August 1988. About 60 soldiers
narrowly escaped death or injury in February when they were
evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just
before a bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the
Household Cavalry barracks at Knightsbridge in central London and at
a bandstand in the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was
playing. Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured in
the bombings.

Neighbors were breakfasting, heading to work
or asleep in bed when an explosion at a military barracks turned
their homes to rubble and they were confronted with the sight of
bodies being carried away.
``There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz.
</P>
<P>
After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me,'' said Joan
Betteridge, a pensioner in the southern England town of Deal, where
the blast at the Royal Marines School of Music occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army claimed reponsibilty for the explosion,
which police said killed 11 people and injured 22.
</P>
<P>
Nearby resident Sean Minnock said: ``I was asleep but woke up
with a hell of a jolt ... the bedroom ceiling fell in on me. I woke
to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor.''
From the wrecked, smoke-clouded barracks, ``I could hear
terrified screams of agony. People started rushing about all over
the place. It was horrible to watch and listen to,'' said Minnock,
28.
``I knew people had been seriously hurt. I saw the rescuers pull
out two bodies. I knew they were dead when they put them on the
floor and put bed blankets right over them.''
Minnock's wife, Janet, said the roof of their house was torn off
and all the back windows were shattered.
``The house has been blown to bits,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Minnock was feeding her 2-year-old son Thomas his breakfast
when the explosion wrecked four terraced houses in the street
backing onto the barracks.
</P>
<P>
Her next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, 26, was standing at her
kitchen window facing the barracks, holding her 4-month-old son Luke
in her arms. Her other boys, Ben, 3, and Joshua, 2, were at her side.
``I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building
explode,'' she said. ``I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned a
sliver of glass embedded itself in his back.
``The whole window was blown across the kitchen. I just screamed
and ran out of the room. The bang was so loud I thought the whole
house was coming in.
``At first I thought for sure Joshua had been seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
There was blood coming out of his back.'' Doctors removed the glass
and sent him home.
</P>
<P>
College student Simon Mitford, 17, narrowly escaped being injured
in the explosion because he got up earlier than usual.
``His room was completely wrecked by the blast,'' his brother
Alex said.
</P>
<P>
Of the barracks, he said: ``I heard music playing and then it
went bang and there was glass everywhere. It was a two-story
building but now 90 percent of it is rubble.
``I heard a marine scream out, `The band is under there.' I was
scared there was going to be a second explosion.''

An explosion today flattened a military
barracks and tore through nearby homes, killing 11 people and
injuring 22, police said. The IRA claimed responsibility for the
blast.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble
of a three-story building that collapsed at the Royal Marines School
of Music near Deal. Stunned neighbors gathered outside homes that
were damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Chief Police Inspector Alan Butterfield of Kent, who who provided
the casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort, first
reported that one person was missing but later said everyone was
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
He said many of the injured were seriously hurt.
``There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz.
</P>
<P>
After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me,'' said
pensioner Joan Betteridge.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Tom King, inspecting the wreckage, said: ``It
is not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb, but all the
evidence is quite clearly that this is an IRA atrocity.''
British military installations are a frequent bombing target of
the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of
British rule, but today's explosion in the coastal town 70 miles
southeast of London was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland
in more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the
barracks. One of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade
ground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British custom.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of homes near the school were damaged, including four that
were destroyed. Witnesses reported hearing the explosion two miles
away.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry would not say how many servicemen and
civilians were included in the casualty figures. However, King told
reporters the attack was directed against ``unarmed bandsmen.''
Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to
search through the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin
Simmons.
</P>
<P>
Ten doctors were giving emergency treatment at the scene and 11
ambulances were taking the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance
service said.
</P>
<P>
A statement telephoned to Ireland International, a Dublin news
agency, said ``we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent'' in
response to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Northern
Ireland nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
The IRA said Mrs. Thatcher went to the British province ``with a
message of war,'' but ``we still want peace and we want the British
government to leave our country.'' It was signed P. O'Neill, a nom
de guerre the IRA usually uses to claim responsibility for actions
outside Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey issued a statement in Dublin
condemning the attack, calling it an ``outrage.''
The last IRA bomb attempt on the British mainland was in February
when about 60 soldiers were evacuated from their barracks in
Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded. One
soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA bomb attack on an army
barracks in north London in August 1988.
</P>
<P>
In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the
Household Cavalry barracks in central London and at a bandstand in
the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was playing. Three
people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
The music school is the training center for young recruits who
want to play in the seven Royal Marines bands. Up to 250 young men,
most between 16 and 20, are based at the school, where they receive
military and musical training.
</P>
<P>
The roof of Janet Minnock's house was torn off by the force of
the blast and all the back windows were shattered.
``The house has been blown to bits,'' she said. ``We are all
shaken up.''
Mrs. Minnock's next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, said she was
standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time of
the explosion. She was holding her 4-month-old son Luke in her arms
with her other boys, Ben, 3, and Joshua, 2, at her side.
``I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building
explode,'' she said. ``I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned a
slither of glass embedded itself in his back. The whole window was
blown across the kitchen. I just screamed and ran out of the room.
</P>
<P>
The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in.''
Sean Minnock said: ``I was asleep but woke up with a hell of a
jolt.''
As workers tried to patch holes in his roof, he said: ``The
bedroom ceiling fell in on me. I woke to find huge slabs of plaster
on the bed and floor. I wondered what it was. As soon as I got up I
looked out of what was left of the window and knew it was the
barracks.''

IRA Attack Stirs Security Controversy

<P>
The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew
apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons
and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.
</P>
<P>
A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveled
the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break between
practice sessions on the school's parade ground.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized, eight of them
in serious condition, police said. They said nine of the dead were
bandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of neighboring homes in the quiet southeastern English
seaside town of Deal were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20, Col.
</P>
<P>
John Ware, principal director of music, said the slain bandsmen all
were trained, adult musicians. They held military ranks but none had
been trained as a fighting soldier.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Irish Republican Army, engaged in a 20-year-old
campaign to drive the British from the province of Northern Ireland,
claimed responsibility in a telephone call to Ireland International,
a Dublin news agency.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the area adjoining the Marines school said Friday
that despite government calls for stepped-up public alertness
against terrorists, security at the school had eased noticeably.
``Anyone in Deal will tell you how easy it is to get into the
base,'' said Fred Verge, a 70-year-old army veteran.
</P>
<P>
Local people laid wreaths and bouquets of flowers at the entrance
to the barracks.
``There is a great sense of anger'' in the community, Kent police
Chief Constable Paul Condon said.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Marines Music School is one of 30 military
establishments in Britain that use private security firms, Defense
Ministry figures show.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified defense sources quoted by the Times newspaper today
said the civilian guards were backed up by armed Marines who
patrolled regularly inside the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Tom King promised a security review and said
new measures had already been taken at the base. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Martin O'Neill, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on
defense, said on Friday: ``Serious questions must be asked about the
penny-pinching policy of the Ministry of Defense, which may well put
our armed services at dreadful risk.''
O'Neill later told British Broadcasting Corp. television the IRA
was ``prepared to take out anybody. The cowardly nature of their
attacks is such that every military establishment is under threat.''
He said private security firms were assigned to areas considered
low risks for attacks.
``If we designate places as being low-risk categories, then it is
likely they will be attacked, given the way that the IRA is forced
to operate,'' O'Neill added.
``The big prizes are no longer available to them, so they're
picking off the ones which they regard ... vulnerable.''
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received news of the bombing
while aboard a jet over Siberia en route from Japan to Moscow. She
called it a ``deeply serious outrage.''
King visited the scene soon after the explosion.
``I know that the people who committed it, the godfathers who
sent them, actually know in their hearts that it is not going to
make any difference; that it is just killing for the sake of
killing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister, anger clearly written on his face, said
that rather than erode the will of the security forces, the attack
``redoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism cannot
win.''
Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland condemned the attack
and sent Mrs. Thatcher a message of sympathy at ``this outrage ...
which has caused severe and tragic loss of life and many injuries.''
The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of the
operation, but said it was a response to a ``message of war''
delivered by Mrs. Thatcher when she visited Northern Ireland nine
days ago.
</P>
<P>
It was an apparent reference to her speech praising the locally
recruited Ulster Defense Regiment as ``a very, very brave group of
men'' who have lost 179 members in IRA attacks since 1970.
</P>
<P>
The mainly Protestant UDR is regarded by many Catholics as a
sectarian force, and is at present under a cloud over allegations
that some recruits leaked names, addresses and photos of IRA
suspects to Protestant assassins.
</P>
<P>
British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA
campaign. Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982 when 11
servicemen were fatally wounded in two bombings in central London.
</P>
<P>
The music school trains young recruits for the seven Royal
Marines bands. Up to 250 young men, most ages 16 to 20, undergo
military and musical training there, working with older,
professional bandsmen.

Family members on Saturday grieved for their
slain loved ones and criticized the security arrangements at the
Royal Marines Music School, where an IRA terrorist attack killed 10
military musicians.
</P>
<P>
Jean Cleatheroe, whose son Andrew was killed, joined local
residents and opposition politicians in denouncing the use of
private security firms to protect the music school and 29 other
military establishments in Britain.
``The security at those barracks was absolutely abysmal. We had
seen it for ourselves. We have always said how easy it would be for
anyone to get in ... What could ordinary security men do to stop
terrorists?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA's
campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the mainly Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982, when 11 servicemen
were fatally wounded in bombings in central London.
</P>
<P>
Shocked residents of Deal gathered outside the barracks to lay
flowers in tribute to the young men they called the ``Bandies.''
An 11-year-old Royal Marines cadet in full dress uniform marched
to the barracks and smartly saluted the Royal Marines sign.
``I'm proud of my uniform and I'm proud of all the Marines I
knew. I hate the people who did this to them,'' said Scott Roberts.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the
Church of England, visited the injured and said he was impressed
``by their strength and determination that evil will not defeat
them.''
Runcie said one of the men's main concerns was that their hands
would heal properly so they could continue playing their musical
instruments.
</P>
<P>
Police investigating the attack were searching a nearby house
that had been rented briefly by three men with Irish accents.
``We know when the men arrived and when they left,'' Cmdr. George
Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad,
said at a news conference. ``It appears the men left several days
before the explosion.''
He said the house, which overlooks the barracks recreation center
destroyed by the Friday morning blast, was rented by its English
owners to three men for two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
There was no proof the house was an IRA hideout, the commander
said.
``By virtue of the fact that the house is very near the base and
the men are Irish, we are very anxious to talk to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Explosives experts wearing white protective overalls were
painstakingly examining the house Saturday, and Churchill-Coleman
said they would continue for the next two or three days.
</P>
<P>
Police said all 10 men killed during a coffee break between
morning band practices were servicemen. Of 22 men injured, 12
remained hospitalized Saturday, five in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army on Friday claimed responsibility for
the explosion, which also severely damaged several nearby houses.
</P>
<P>
Police have not determined what caused the blast, but
Churchill-Coleman said, ``It would seem to be some form of
improvised device using high explosives.'' The IRA did not specify
how it caused the blast.

Prince Philip Condemns IRA, Clergy Urge Forgiveness

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>DEAL, Britain (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prince Philip on Sunday condemned the
``senseless'' killing of 10 Royal Marines musicians in an IRA
bombing, and Britain's defense secretary said he warned all
military bases of the risk of similar attacks.
</P>
<P>
Clergyman urged relatives and friends of dead and maimed
musicians to forgive the bombers. ``Only forgiveness breaks the tie
between the hater and the hated,'' the Rev. George Lings told
mourners.
</P>
<P>
The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and captain general of
the Royal Marines, visited injured men in the hospital and toured
the severely damaged Royal Marines School of Music in Deal,
southeast Britain.
``It will not help the IRA win anything,'' said Philip, who wore
a Royal Marines tie. ``It is senseless. One simply wonders what
sort of mentality can even contemplate such meaningless acts. It is
appalling.''
He paid tribute to the 12 injured men, five of whom were
critically wounded.
</P>
<P>
The prince was accompanied by Viscountess Mountbatten, daughter
of Lord Mountbatten, who was killed by an IRA bomb on his boat in
1979. Mountbatten was India's last viceroy and a cousin of the
queen.
</P>
<P>
British military installations are a frequent target of the
Irish Republican Army in its campaign to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Tom King said Sunday he has issued an alert to
all military installations to prevent other attacks. He would not
give details.
``The perpetrators of the latest outrage are at large and there
is a risk of other attacks,'' King said. ``That is why we are
taking a number of other steps.''
King defended the use of private security firms hired to guard
the Deal school and 29 other ``low-risk'' military installations in
Britain. Local residents and grieving relatives have said security
was lax and should be turned back to the marines. King said the
private firms will remain.
``It is important to remember that what we need in these cases
are eyes and ears and observation,'' King said on British
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
``Private security guards can be a very useful additional
assistance. They also help to reduce the amount of time soldiers
have to spend on what is not the most enjoyable part of their
activity.''
At church services throughout the small port, clergymen urged
mourners to pray for and forgive the bombers.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Charles Howard, a Royal Navy chaplain, asked the
300-member congregation inside the barracks, ``if you can find room
in your hearts ... pray for the men who perpetrated this terrible
act, that God will soften their hearts and turn them from their
violent and evil ways.''
Many cried as Howard read aloud the names of the 10 servicemen
killed during a coffee break between band practices. It was the
worst IRA attack on the British mainland since July 1982.
</P>
<P>
At nearby St. George's Church, formerly the Royal Marines'
church, Lings said, ``no one says forgiveness is easy; no one says
the terrorist deserves forgiveness.
``But ... forgive them, they not what they do.''

Prime Minister Condemns IRA for Music School Explosion
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>DEAL, England (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal
Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are
``monsters'' who will be found and punished.
``The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers
who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a
very long time,'' she said following a tour of the school's wrecked
barracks in Deal, southeast England.
``We lost 10 remarkable musicians, not fighting men, just
because some people try to bomb others out of their democratic
views,'' she said. ``They are very evil people, absolute monsters.''
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of
the IRA, issued a statement disputing Mrs. Thatcher's remarks,
saying ``she knows in her heart of hearts the real nature of the
conflict, its cause and the remedy.''
The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
``We want an end to all violent deaths arising out of the
present relationship between our two countries,'' Adams said. ``We
want a new peaceful relationship based on an acceptance and respect
for our rights as a sovereign nation.''
After visiting some of the 11 injured bandsmen still in the
hospital, Mrs. Thatcher pledged: ``The hunt for the bombers will be
pursued with all possible speed, vigor and dedication.''
Raymond Kendall, the secretary-general of the international
police organization Interpol, pledged the organization's full
support in the hunt for those who blew up the school.
``I hope we will have a part to play in finding them,'' said
Kendall after opening the International Police Exhibition and
Conference in London.
``They are criminals of the worst sort and should be dealt with
as such.''
Before landing in Deal, Mrs. Thatcher's helicopter flew over the
rubble that had been the band's recreation center.
</P>
<P>
The IRA claimed responsibility for the explosion, and police
said they are looking for three men with Irish accents who rented a
house overlooking the barracks.

10 KILLED, 22 HURT BY IRA BOMB AT ENGLAND BARRACKS 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday 
that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England 
to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously. It would be one 
of the outlawed IRA's deadliest attacks on the main British island. 
</P>
<P>
Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast, which also damaged 
dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away. The musicians were 
between the ages of 16 and 20 as are most of the recruits in the school. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with 
certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb. But he said the 
characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared 
to confirm that it was the work of the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said they believe that at least two IRA "active service" 
units, each composed of four or five members, are operating in Britain and 
continental Europe. 
</P>
<P>
One member, known as the "Jackal" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth 
novel "The Day of the Jackal," has been eluding the authorities for two years. 
He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA's last 
successful mainland bombing attack - on an army barracks at Mill Hill in 
August, 1988. One soldier was killed in that incident.

Sheehy and another wanted Irishman, John Conaghty, were linked to an IRA bomb 
factory in North London that the police stumbled upon last December while in 
pursuit of a car thief. A search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons, 
ammunition, 150 pounds of Semtex high explosive and a "hit list" of 100 British 
political figures and other officials headed by Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's explosion occurred about 8:30 a.m. in a lounge at the Royal Marines 
School of Music near Deal, on the English Channel in the county of Kent. At the 
school are about 250 recruits who receive military and musical training before 
joining Royal Marines bands. 
</P>
<P>
The roof of the three-story barracks collapsed, trapping victims beneath the 
rubble. Firefighters used thermal cameras and dogs to search the debris for 
victims and survivors. Heavy lifting gear was brought to the scene from a 
nearby site where a tunnel is being built beneath the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers shouted for quiet as they used high-technology listening equipment in 
an effort to trace the sound of faint heartbeats. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode," Heather 
Hackett, a 26-year-old Deal housewife, told the British Press Assn. She said 
she told her children to run for cover, but as they did, her kitchen window 
shattered. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole window was blown across the kitchen," Hackett recalled. Her 
2-year-old son, Joshua, was hit by a shard that embedded itself in his back but 
caused no serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I just screamed and ran out of the room," she said. "The bang was so loud I 
thought the whole house was coming in." 
</P>
<P>
'Appalling Outrage' 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Tom King visited the scene and called the bombing "an 
appalling outrage committed against unarmed bandsmen - people who worked for 
charity, who have given great enjoyment to millions right across the country, 
right across the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The real evil of these murders is that the people who commit them, the 
'godfathers' who send them to commit them, know that they will actually achieve 
nothing. Terrorism is not going to win. We shall find the people responsible 
for this outrage sooner or later, as we have already found some of those 
responsible for the earlier outrages, and they will be brought to justice." 
</P>
<P>
The authorities have been on high alert, expecting IRA attacks in connection 
with last month's 20th anniversary of the introduction of British troops into 
Northern Ireland. The republican underground organization opposes British rule 
in the predominantly Protestant province and is fighting to join the mainly 
Roman Catholic south in a united, independent Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Visit to Ulster 
</P>
<P>
But in a statement telephoned to a Dublin news agency, Ireland International, 
Friday's attack was linked to Thatcher's visit last week to units of the 
controversial Ulster Defense Regiment in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The locally recruited, overwhelmingly Protestant Ulster Defense Regiment has 
come under fire in connection with an investigation into the leak of secret 
government lists of suspected IRA members to Protestant assassination squads. 
It is widely hated by the Catholic minority in the province, and the Irish 
government in Dublin has urged Britain to disband the force. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Thatcher visited Ireland with a message of war at a time when we want 
peace," the statement claiming responsibility for the Deal attack said. "Now in 
turn we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent. But we still want peace, and we 
want the British government to leave our country." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed "P. O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau," a 
signature that has appeared on earlier IRA bombing claims. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's attack was the worst on the mainland since the virtually simultaneous 
bombings of July, 1982, directed at ceremonial military units in London's Hyde 
Park and Regent's Park. Eleven bandsmen and mounted guards were killed in those 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Eight persons were killed by IRA car bombs outside Harrods department store 
here in December, 1983, and 21 were killed and 162 injured in two Birmingham 
public house bombings in the fall of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
An attempted barracks bombing was averted last February when a sentry came upon 
two intruders who had managed to get inside a military camp in Shropshire. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a series of bomb and automatic rifle attacks this year on 
British soldiers and their families stationed in West Germany. Earlier this 
month an IRA gunman shot to death an army wife, Heidi Hazell, 25, in her car 
near her home at Dortmund.
