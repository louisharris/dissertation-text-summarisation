Senate Panel OKs Envoy to Italy
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today
endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F.
</P>
<P>
Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he
feared Secchia might ``embarrass the United States'' because of his
``penchant for making gross remarks.''
The committee's vote was 13-0 in favor of Secchia, a former
Republican national committeeman for Michigan and lumber industry
executive.
</P>
<P>
The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., voted ``present,'' meaning they took no
position.
</P>
<P>
Pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts
``containing the distasteful specifics of Mr. Secchia's remarks.''
At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledged
to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful
language than he had been in his different role as a political
organizer and enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
But Pell said he was unpersuaded.
``Tact and careful speech are hallmarks of successful
diplomats,'' Pell said. ``Mr. Secchia has demonstrated that he
would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to
Italy.''
``Italian friends of mine telephoned me from Rome, aghast at the
prospect of having Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their
country,'' the chairman said.
``I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all
likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the
administration and the United States,'' Pell said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that since Secchia is ``the president's choice'' he
would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it.

Senate Democrats Question ``Unqualified'' Bush Appointees
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real
estate developer named by President Bush as U.S. ambassador to
Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to
Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show.
</P>
<P>
Gildenhorn, according to Senate sources, is one of several Bush
ambassadorial nominees who have been rated ``unqualified'' by the
American Academy of Diplomacy, an organization composed of former
high ranking diplomats, including all living former secretaries of
state.
</P>
<P>
One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and
contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000
during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National
State Elections Committee. The gift was not subject to the
disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act.
</P>
<P>
The 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by
Gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by
Senate Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP
contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved
for Foreign Service professionals.
</P>
<P>
Gildenhorn said Friday he could not comment because he is ``in a
confirmation process.''
A report prepared by the State Department for the Foreign
Relations Committee said Gildenhorn would make an ``excellent''
candidate for an ambassadorship because of his ``solid background in
law and management.''
It also cited another qualification.
``Mr. Gildenhorn has been a strong Republican supporter being a
member of the Eagles and Team 100,'' the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Eagles are contributors of $10,000 or more in a
single year to the Republican National Committee, while Team 100
designates people who have donated $100,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
Gildenhorn's political contributions are listed on a disclosure
form submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has
set a hearing on the nomination for this week.
</P>
<P>
They totaled $14,675 in 1984, $17,000 in 1985; $25,469.97 in
1986; $25,250 in 1987; $104,350 in 1988; and $11,000 this year. The
total: $197,744.97.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, his wife, Alma Lee, gave $20,125 over the six
years, including $13,000 in 1988; his daughter, Carolyn, gave
$2,000; his son, Michael, gave $4,050 and his father, Oscar
Gildenhorn, gave $5,750.
</P>
<P>
That brings the total contributions made by Gildenhorn and his
family to the GOP to $229,669.97 since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Gildenhorn gave $50,000 during the period to the Republican
National Committee or to the Republican Eagles.
</P>
<P>
He gave $2,500 in 1985 and $5,000 in 1986 to the Fund for the
American Future, a Bush political action committee and contributed
the legal limit of $1,000 to the Bush campaign in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Gildenhorn also gave thousands of dollars to Republican
congressional candidates. Included were gifts to the campaigns of
Sens. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Bill Cohen, R-Maine; Pete Domenici,
R-N.M.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; John Warner, R-Va.; Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; and former Sen. Paula Hawkins, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
Gildenhorn, 59, is a senior partner in Brown, Gildenhorn and
Jacobs, a law firm specializing in real estate. He is also president
of the JBG Real Estate Associates and JBG Properties Inc.
</P>
<P>
Gildenhorn is also vice chairman of the board of directors of the
Sovran Bank here. He is a graduate of the University of Maryland and
Yale University Law School.
</P>
<P>
Other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the American
Academy of Diplomacy include Florida real estate developer Joseph
Zappala, nominated as ambassador to Spain; Melvin L. Sembler, a real
estate executive in Florida named to be ambassador to Australia; and
Della M. Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker named to be
ambassador to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
No action has been taken by the Senate on any of those
nominations.
</P>
<P>
According to Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who first raised the
issue of political contributions, Zappala and Sembler each
contributed more than $100,000 to Republican candidates and causes.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Newman served as chairman of the Washington state Bush for
President committee.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador David Popper, president of the Academy of Diplomacy,
declined to confirm that Gildenhorn and the other three nominees had
been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
But he said the academy does offer such ratings, making its
judgments based on a comparison of the nominee's biography and the
requirements of the job.
</P>
<P>
He said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political
appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be
qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the United States
abroad with ``dignity, respect and ability.''
Twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by Bush in the first
six months of his administration have gone to non-professionals,
many of them large contributors to Republican causes, committee
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sarbanes says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps
with amateurs rewarded for purely political services.
``Political throwaways,'' Sarbanes calls them.
``I think the time has come, very frankly, to get off the money
merry-go-round and ask some very difficult questions, essentially
about when extensive political contributions are going to be a
sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination,'' Sarbanes
told the committee last month.
``It's not true in every instance, but in most of these cases you
seem to have to be over the $100,000 mark in order to make the
consideration list,'' Sarbanes said.
</P>
<P>
Sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such,
noting that many of them compiled distinguished records.
``It is not the political ambassadors that are the problem,''
Sarbanes said. ``It is ambassadors without qualifications.''

Ronald Spiers Replaces Joseph Reed As Top U.S. Official at U.N.
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald I. Spiers, a veteran U.S. diplomat,
will be the new undersecretary-general for General Assembly
affairs, the top-ranking American post at the world body, U.N.
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spiers was ambassador to Pakistan from 1981-83 and has served as
ambassador to the Bahamas and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He replaces Joseph Verner Reed, a banker who served in the post
from 1987 until leaving last winter to become chief of protocol for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Although Spiers' nomination as undersecretary-general for
Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat Services had
been an open secret for months, Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar announced it was effective as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spiers, 64, is a career foreign service officer, most recently
serving as undersecretary of state for management since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Spiers has been a member of the U.S. delegation to the United
Nations; was director of political affairs for the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency; and was director of NATO Affairs
for the State Department.
</P>
<P>
From 1966-69, Spiers was counselor for political affairs in the
U.S. Embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, he became assistant secretary of State in charge of the
department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.
</P>
<P>
When the Bahamas became independent from Britain in 1973, Spiers
became the first U.S. ambassador to that nation.
</P>
<P>
He became charge d'affaires in London in 1974, and was minister
of the U.S. Embassy there until 1977, when he was appointed
ambassador to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In 1980 he returned to the State Department as director of
Intelligence and Research, and was appointed ambassador to Pakistan
in 1981.

Bush Names Deane Hinton as Ambassador to Panama
</HL>

</HL>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush has named career diplomat Deane
Hinton as ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hinton, currently ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador
Arthur H. Davis, who was recalled by Bush in protest of what the
administration considered the stealing of the Panamanian elections
last May by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
Bush sent Davis back to Panama City after the Dec. 20 invasion
of Panama by U.S. forces and installation of Guillermo Endara as
president. Independent observers mostly concluded Endara had won
the elections by a hefty margin.
</P>
<P>
Bush named Hinton as a recess appointment because Congress is
not in session. That means Hinton can serve until the end of next
year before he must go before the Senate for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the 66-year-old Hinton, with his long
expierience on Latin American issues, is seen as a signal of the
importance Bush is placing on restoring normal relations with
Panama. Those relations steadily deteriorated after the United
States indicted Noriega, once a ally particularly of the U.S.
intelligence community, on drug trafficking charges in Florida.
</P>
<P>
Hinton has been ambassador to Costa Rica since 1987. Before that
he was ambassador to Pakistan from 1983 to 1987, and ambassador to
El Salvador from 1981 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
He was assistant secretary of state for economic and business
affairs from 1979 to 1981, and before that U.S. representative to
the 12-nation European Community, headquartered in Brussels, a
State Department adviser on economic affairs, and director and
economic counselor of the State Department's Agency for economic
Development in Chile and in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former State Department consultant and former
ambassador to Paraguay, was sent to Panama by President Reagan in
1986.
</P>
<P>
Bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was
appropriate with the installation of a new government in Panama,
said one administration official.
</P>
<P>
Officials described Hinton as ``an experienced Latin America
hand'' and a good person to have in place with the volatile
developments in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, called Hinton highly qualified for the post because of his
``wide-ranging experience and expertise in Central America.''
However, Mitchell said he hoped Bush would send the appointment
to the Senate after Congress convenes Jan. 23 despite the nature of
the recess appointment.

Woman Ready to be Tapped as Ambassador to Nicaragua
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush is expected to name a female
career diplomat as U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua as that country
prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro,
according to informed sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Thursday it is virtually certain the
appointment will go to Melissa Wells, 57, currently ambassador to
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
They said the administration believed a female ambassador could
relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who takes office
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They also said the administration is eager to have more women in
key posts. Only rarely have U.S. ambassadorships in Latin America
gone to women.
</P>
<P>
In choosing Ms. Wells, the administration passed over several
male career diplomats with long experience in that region, said the
sources, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Wells, who was born in Estonia, has no prior experience in
Latin America. Her personnel record indicates she speaks Spanish.
</P>
<P>
Wells' name was submitted to the White House by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III for the Managua post, and approval is
considered ``99.9 percent certain,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each
other's capitals since July 1988.
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista government expelled then-U.S. ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats on the grounds they were
interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling Nicaraguan
Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the
Nicaraguan embassy here.
</P>
<P>
But a new era in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations is expected to open
with the inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated President
Daniel Ortega in elections this February.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle and a large congressional delegation
are expected to represent Bush at her inaugural.
</P>
<P>
The administration has asked Congress for $300 million in
assistance to Nicaragua, part of which would be used for resettling
Contra rebels. But the request has been stalled by Senate
Democrats, some of whom believe that Eastern Europe has a greater
claim on U.S. resources than Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Wells' nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986
encountered strong opposition from Senate conservatives who held up
the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward
that country.
</P>
<P>
The nomination finally was approved in September 1987.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leader of the campaign to hold up
Wells' nomination, said he wanted to pressure the administration
into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to Mozambique's
Marxist government.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has since moderated its policies and is now off the
U.S. government's list of countries under Marxist rule.

Veteran Diplomat Displaces First Choice for Managua Post
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush administration is expected to name
career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to
Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says.
</P>
<P>
The administration had planned to send another career diplomat,
Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after
concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight
because she has been a target of conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua
quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that
U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost
11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving
Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation
after long years of warfare.
</P>
<P>
The United States has had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July
1988. At the time, the Sandinista government expelled Ambassador
Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were
interfering in the country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight
Nicaraguan envoys in Washington, including Ambassador Carlos
Tunnermann.
</P>
<P>
Shlaudeman, who has served as ambassador to Argentina, Peru,
Brazil and Venezuela, is a premier State Department specialist on
Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
He retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called
back to duty last fall to serve as a State Department liaison with
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
</P>
<P>
Shlaudeman, who will turn 64 next week, was approached by a
senior State Department official weeks ago about going to Managua
but said he was not interested.
</P>
<P>
He told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally
by President Bush. When Bush telephoned him earlier this week,
Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the U.S. official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his ambassadorial posts, Shlaudeman was the top
Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a
diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several of
his conservative allies would not assure the administration that
they would not delay Wells' nomination.
</P>
<P>
When Wells was nominated to be ambassador to Mozambique in late
1986, Helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for 11
months. They took the action as a means of expressing opposition to
the Reagan administration's friendship toward Mozambique's Marxist
government.

["Highlights" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "The New U.S.

<P>
Ambassador"] 
The new U.S. ambassador to Jordan, Wesley Egan, is 
a heavyweight. Once the second man in the U.S. Embassy in 
Cairo, he also served in Saudi Arabia, two African countries, 
and a European nation. His choice for the new job signals the 
importance the United States attaches to Jordan in terms of 
inter-Arab politics and the Arab-Israeli dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Before Egan's appointment became final, he had to go through 
a grueling test in the U.S. Senate, where Senator Daniel 
Moynihan, the Zionist Democrat from New York, presided over the 
hearing that scrutinized the would-be ambassador's credentials 
and went on to confirm his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Egan told the hearing he would work to 
develop relations between the United States and Jordan and 
enhance Jordan's role in the peace process. He pointed out that 
Jordan signed a joint agenda with Israel that will presumably 
culminate in a peace treaty between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
His said his top priority in Amman will be to propel the 
peace process forward and recognize Jordan's energetic role in 
the effort to bring about a comprehensive Middle East peace. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Egan will pay special attention to stability in Jordan, and 
watch its democratic march and economic development. He will 
also watch Jordan's approach to a number of other issues: human 
rights, compliance with the sanctions resolution against Iraq, 
terminating the boycott of U.S. companies doing business with 
Israel, the potential for foreign investment both in Jordan and 
elsewhere in the region, and the fight against terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Much as I take exception to some of the issues that will 
engage the new ambassador's attention, I concern myself here 
with a lecture Moynihan delivered at the confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the West Bank and Gaza, he dismissed as 
inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied 
territories, and asked: If these are occupied territories, who 
were they occupied by? These territories, contended the 
senator, were never the sovereign domain of anyone; it was 
Jordan that occupied the West Bank at the founding of the state 
of Israel. What Israel did was to take the West Bank from 
Jordan the way it took Gaza from Egypt. Previously, these 
territories were part of the British mandate, and before that 
they fell within the realm of the Ottoman Empire. Mr. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan's point, in other words, is that these territories are 
up for grabs. The United States, he noted, never recognized 
Jordan's sovereignty over the West Bank. His bottom line: 
Israel did not occupy territory that was under another nation's 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
This Zionist senator's remarks are not supposed to be 
Washington's official line. However, they do mirror an 
undeclared U.S. line dictated by the all-powerful Zionist lobby 
- a line that is now all but declared with the bizarre voting 
stance of the United States toward the UN Security Council 
resolution condemning the Hebron massacre.

BUSH REPORTEDLY PICKS EX-CIA OFFICER AS AMBASSADOR TO CHINA 
</HL>

<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, filling a key overseas post, has decided to nominate a former 
CIA officer as ambassador to China, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The choice is James R. Lilley, a career intelligence officer who served as CIA 
station chief in China when Bush headed the U.S. liaison office there in 
1974-75. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the expected nomination came as Bush's choice to be assistant secretary 
of state for Latin America, Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, 
ran into objections from several Republican members of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, congressional aides said. 
</P>
<P>
The two senior Republicans on the panel, Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Richard 
G. Lugar (R-Ind.), both expressed concern about Aronson's appointment to 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the aides said. 
</P>
<P>
May Face Tough Questioning 
</P>
<P>
They said that it appears unlikely the senators would attempt to block 
Aronson's nomination but said that the former Jimmy Carter aide will face tough 
questioning in his confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Lilley, 60, was born in China, the son of an American oilman working there. He 
has also served on the National Security Council staff, as head of the 
unofficial U.S. office in Taiwan and as a deputy assistant secretary of state 
for East Asia. He will replace Winston Lord, who has headed the American 
Embassy in Beijing since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, Lilley served as U.S. ambassador to South Korea. In 
that job, he was the principal American contact with South Korean leaders 
during the turbulent period when former President Chun Doo Hwan resigned and 
the current president, Roh Tae Woo, won a bitterly contested election. 
</P>
<P>
Returns to Washington 
</P>
<P>
Lilley left Seoul last month and returned to Washington, hoping to be appointed 
as assistant secretary of state in charge of U.S. policy in East Asia and the 
Pacific, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he failed to get that job, in part because newly appointed Deputy 
Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger opposed him, the sources said. 
Eagleburger was said to have been promoting two other candidates - Lord and 
U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Nicholas Platt - for the Asian post. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger and Lord served together as aides to former Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger.

Negroponte, a 28-year Foreign Service veteran, served as U.S. ambassador to 
Honduras from 1981 through 1985, when the CIA was secretly funding the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's leftist opposition party already has criticized the appointment, which 
has not been formally announced. But Bush Administration officials said they 
are confident that the Mexican government of President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari will accept the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Can Reject Nomination 
</P>
<P>
Under diplomatic practice, the White House notifies other governments in 
advance of its choices for ambassadors. The foreign government can reject the 
nomination, but rejection would be considered an unusual diplomatic slap. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush's choice as assistant secretary of state for Latin America, 
Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from 
several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
congressional aides said. 
</P>
<P>
The two senior Republicans on the panel, Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) and 
Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), both expressed concern about Aronson's appointment 
to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the aides said. Helms questioned the 
appointment of a Democrat to the post, and Lugar expressed concern that Aronson 
had no experience with the economic issues facing South America, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The aides said it appears unlikely that the senators will attempt to block 
Aronson's nomination but that the former aide to President Jimmy Carter will 
face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte created controversy in Honduras as a vigorous proponent of the 
then-secret Contra effort; and Honduran opposition leaders, who said he acted 
as though he were the governor of a colony, dubbed him Washington's "proconsul" 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But he later concluded that it had been a mistake for the Ronald Reagan 
Administration to aid the rebels secretly without building more public support 
for its policy in Central America, associates said. 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte was most recently a deputy to Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, President 
Reagan's last national security adviser, and had been an aide to Henry A. 
Kissinger, then national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, during 
the Vietnam war in 1970-73. 
</P>
<P>
He has also worked on negotiations with Mexico on environmental and 
tuna-fishing issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the smartest operators in the business," a former aide said. "He's 
very good at working the bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said that they had expected Mexican leftists to 
register complaints about the appointment because of Negroponte's support of 
the Contras but that they are confident that Salinas' government will not 
object formally. 
</P>
<P>
"They will blow a little steam off in the press, but I don't think the Mexican 
government would dream of rejecting him," one official said. "They don't want 
to get relations with the Bush Administration off on that footing." 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte, 49, will succeed Charles Pilliod, an Ohio industrialist.

3 AMBASSADORIAL NOMINATIONS SQUEAK BY IN SENATE COMMITTEE

</DATELINE>

<P>
Three of President Bush's ambassadorial nominees, whom Democrats said had no 
qualifications except political connections, won narrow approval Tuesday from 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) joined the Republican members as the panel first 
voted, 10 to 9, to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Florida real 
estate developer Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in voice votes, the committee approved the equally controversial 
nominations of Florida real estate developer Marvin Sembler to be ambassador to 
Australia and Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker, to be 
ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Robb said later that he was troubled over Zappala's "quite thin" qualifications 
for the job but that he felt he had made an "implicit" commitment to vote for 
the nominee when he interviewed him May 11 and did not clearly indicate that he 
would oppose him. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who led the opposition to the nominations, vowed 
to carry the fight to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
"One looks through this resume wondering why this person has been appointed to 
this position," Sarbanes said of Zappala. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is to be found in the appendix, which lists the campaign 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Zappala reported to the committee that he contributed $126,000 last year to 
Republican campaigns and gave $17,900 in the previous two years. His prior 
governmental experience, described on the ambassadorial evaluation form 
submitted to the committee, consisted mainly of chairing campaign finance 
committees for President Bush and the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Other Approvals 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the committee routinely approved the nomination of Shirley 
Temple Black to be ambassador to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
It also approved the nominations of Thomas Melady to be ambassador to the 
Vatican, William Howard Taft IV to be the permanent U.S. representative on the 
Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Keith L. Brown to be 
ambassador to Denmark, and Joseph Gildenhorn, a Washington lawyer and real 
estate developer, to be ambassador to Switzerland.

WASHINGTON - President Bush plans to name United Nations
Ambassador Thomas Pickering as U.S. envoy to India, and
appoint the current head of the foreign service to succeed
him.
</P>
<P>
The White House, according to a U.S. official, hasn't yet
informed the Senate, which must confirm the nominations of
Mr. Pickering and Foreign Service Director General Edward
Perkins, a former U.S. envoy to South Africa.
With the end of the Cold War, the U.N. is playing an
increasingly important role in working to resolve regional
disputes. It has led efforts to end civil wars in El Salvador
and Cambodia, and it also helped monitor elections in
Namibia. Last Friday, during an unprecedented U.N. Security
Council meeting of heads of state, President Bush reaffirmed
the U.N.'s leading role in peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
The assignment in India could be an important one. India
and its neighbor Pakistan remain embroiled in a long, bitter
feud that has the potential of becoming one of the world's
few remaining nuclear standoffs.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Pickering was one of President Bush's first
ambassadorial appointments. He served at the U.N. during the
time the administration was involved in the delicate
negotiations that led to the formation of the coalition
against Iraq in the Persian Gulf War and the U.N. sanctions
against Saddam Hussein's regime.
</P>
<P>
But some senior State Department officials have been
irritated by what they call Mr. Pickering's propensity for
the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, when the Reagan administration drew the
line against communist-backed insurgences in Central America,
Mr. Pickering played an active role in that effort as U.S.
envoy to El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Perkins was the U.S. ambassador to South Africa in
1986, when the U.S. imposed economic sanctions against that
nation's white-minority government to pressure it to end
apartheid. Mr. Perkins, who is black, traveled widely across
South Africa during this period, making sure he was seen in
black townships, attending church services and funerals, as
well as in white communities.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Pickering, reached over the weekend, refused to
comment on his future plans, and Mr. Perkins couldn't be
reached.
