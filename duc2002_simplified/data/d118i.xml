Defense Secretary-Designate Tower Hospitalized
</HL>

<P>
Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense
secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon
polyp, a hospital spokesman said.
``Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair
condition,'' hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night.
``The senator is expected to make a full recovery.''
Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted
to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a
colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood
said.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood
said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's
surgeon, Dr. R.D. Dignan, of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's surgery took approximately three hours, Habgood said.
</P>
<P>
When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp
also was discovered and removed. Tests of that growth showed it to
contain some ``malignant but well differentiated cells,'' Habgood
said.
</P>
<P>
Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come
from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday
night, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a
defense consultant. He also served as an arms negotiator for
President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-Contra
investigative panel.
</P>
<P>
President-elect Bush designated Tower as his defense secretary on
Dec. 16. The nomination is subject to Senate approval.

Contradictions Cited In Tower Testimony About Defense Firm
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary-designate John Tower
contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his
work for a British firm involved no military matters, according to
reports published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new questions were raised about the thoroughness of
the FBI's background investigation of the embattled nominee. One
newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents, including
early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire, apparently were
overlooked in the probe.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of
Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee,
on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits,
including his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
Tower, who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is
pending, has denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol
or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties.
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined on Saturday to
comment on the latest reports, saying ``it's (the nomination) before
the committee.''
Tower's designated spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers of Dallas, did
not answer a reporter's calls Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In written testimony to the Senate panel on Jan. 26, Tower said
he could ``recall no actions in connection with any defense
activities'' in connection with his work for the U.S. subsidiary of
British Aerospace, Inc.
</P>
<P>
That statement, according to two publications, The Los Angeles
Times and the Legal Times, did not square with information which
Tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in
June of 1987.
</P>
<P>
In the divorce deposition, Tower said he went to work for British
Aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nation's chief
strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell
training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon,
the Los Angeles Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Tower told the Senate committee he worked chiefly on selling
commercial aircraft to U.S. airlines and also advised the firm on
trade legislation and currency fluctuations. He said he earned
$265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December.
</P>
<P>
The Legal Times said Tower told the divorce attorneys that he was
retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons
systems to the Pentagon, and that he listed the various weapons
involved. The deposition was never filed in court because Tower did
not contest the divorce, but a copy was obtained by the FBI, the
Legal Times said. It said its reporters were allowed by attorneys to
read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly.
</P>
<P>
The New York Post reported Saturday that the FBI apparently has
not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine certain police
records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower.
</P>
<P>
The Post, citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer, said the
incidents included an early-morning episode on June 6, 1967, when
Tower was trapped in his hotel suite in Dallas by a blaze he
accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair.
</P>
<P>
When firemen broke into his room to remove him, ``he was
reportedly in no condition to free himself,'' the Post said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two
early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and,
two years earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick
Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way
home from work. The youth was not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Bill Carter refused comment on specifics of the
Tower investigation, but said ``We will follow any lead.''
On Friday, Tower authorized the release of a statement that
recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice
President Dan Quayle said, ``I have never seen drinking being a
factor in John Tower's life other than a social glass of wine.''
Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was ``no question''
that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said:
``He is not an alcoholic. He's not had a drinking problem for
years.''

<P>
Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued a terse
statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower
but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate
Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used to drink up to a
bottle of scotch at a sitting.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post
that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habits in the 1970s
came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, ``like a ton of
bricks'' and was a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story
to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friends _ not Tower
alone _ had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with staff and advisers, Combest, who worked for
then-Sen. Tower in the 1970s, issued a two-sentence statement
supporting his fellow Texan.
``As a member of Congress, I have tremendous respect and full
confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this country's
armed forces. In my judgment, John Tower will be a superb secretary
of defense,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Combest spokesman Rich Adams refused to comment further, and said
Combest was not available to speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported that Combest described for Nunn and
Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the
committee, Tower's heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s. A
congressional source was quoted as saying that Combest told the
senators that Tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch
two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
Trudi Boyd, Combest's administrative assistant, told the Post
that Combest originally went to Nunn and Warner to tell them Tower
had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Boyd also told the Post that a ``group of people'' drank the
entire bottle of scotch, not Tower alone. That was the account
Combest gave the FBI following his talk with Nunn and Warner, the
newspaper said. It said that in that account, Combest said that he
had only seen Tower drunk on two or three occasions.
</P>
<P>
Tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively in the 1970s,
but says he has reduced his intake to wine with dinner. On Sunday,
he promised to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirmed as defense
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Combest, 43, worked for Tower for seven years, 1971-1978, as a
legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy.
</P>
<P>
Tower served in the Senate for 24 years, deciding not to seek
re-election in 1984. He was chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee from 1981 through 1984.
</P>
<P>
The committee, now controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 along
party lines last Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject
Tower's nomination.

<P>
The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected
the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary,
delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his
term.
</P>
<P>
The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate
focused on Tower's drinking habits, behavior toward women and his
business dealings with defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
It was only the ninth time in 200 years that the Senate has voted
to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it has done
so early in a new administration.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the Senate during the
roll call, underscoring Bush's commitment to the nominee. The Senate
galleries were packed and virtually all senators were in their seats
as the roll was called.
``The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not
confirmed,'' Quayle intoned after the vote.
</P>
<P>
Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of
the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to
declare her opposition. She said her ``most serious concerns'' were
over Tower's activities as a defense consultant after serving as an
arms control negotiator. She also expressed doubts that he would pay
enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military.
</P>
<P>
Tower's Republican defenders began to speak of him in the past
tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat, even before
the roll was called.
``Just moments ago I took a call from John Tower,'' said Sen.
</P>
<P>
John Warner of Virginia, the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
``His head is high, his voice is strong,'' Warner said. ``He
asked me to convey thanks _ in his words _ to the troops who rallied
to his support.''
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, moved to repair
damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the Senate
and President Bush.
``I know what's in my heart and in my mind,'' he told reporters.
``I want to directly, clearly and unambiguously say that this
doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the president.''
Dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after
acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an
extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove
he could abstain from drinking.
</P>
<P>
There was no doubt about the outcome as the Senate went through
the motions of debating the nomination through the final hours
before the roll call.
</P>
<P>
The last few undecided senators declared their positions. Sen.
</P>
<P>
John B. Breaux, D-La., said he would vote against Tower. Sen. James
M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said he would support the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Senators from both parties credited Tower's defeat to the
decision to oppose him made by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee.
``When he made his decision all the other Democrats wheeled in
behind him,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
</P>
<P>
With the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable, White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``If necessary, we'll come up
with a (new) candidate very rapidly.''
Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation as a
replacement for Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, a
former secretary of the Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft.
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft replied ``No'' when asked this morning if he was in
line for the Pentagon job.
``It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and
the national security adviser, any number of congressmen and
senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on
the tip of their tongue,'' Fitzwater said.
``But the time has not come,'' he added. ``The time will come as
soon as the vote is completed. We will wait until then.''
The most recent Associated Press survey showed 52 Democrats and
one Republican committed to vote against Tower or leaning strongly
in that direction. It showed 41 Republicans and three Democrats
declared for Tower or leaning his way.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the White House said it wanted to see the
nomination go all the way to a vote.
</P>
<P>
Tower, meanwhile, reported for work at the Pentagon where he and
his three daughters had coffee together. He then continued a review
of various administration proposals.
``I hope and believe we can work together on important matters,''
Mitchell said. ``The tension of this issue will have no long-lasting
effect on the relationship. I want to say from the bottom of my
heart that I hope this will be the case.''
The already slim chance Tower would be confirmed was dealt a
crushing blow on Wednesday as a parade of previously undecided
Democratic senators announced they would vote ``no.''
Only Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said he would vote ``yes,''
joining just two other Democrats who have made that decision.
</P>
<P>
Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va., Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., J. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
all said they would vote against Tower.
</P>
<P>
Johnston said his reading of the FBI report on Tower leaves him
with the clear impression that Tower's personality changes when he
drinks heavily, leading to ``a recklessness in the social sense''
entirely different from his behavior when sober.

A Week Later, Only Ripples Left from Tower Defeat

<P>
John G. Tower has fallen, but the sky has not.
</P>
<P>
For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked
Tower's path to the Pentagon, business is proceeding as usual.
</P>
<P>
President Bush said the case was closed and accepted Democratic
assurances of future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more
ardent Republican allies in the Senate and in some corners of the
White House. Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded
like assurances of support from a dozen Senate Democrats. They ended
up with only three Democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against
Tower.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a week after the former Texas senator was denied
confirmation as secretary of defens, the waters have closed.
</P>
<P>
There will be ripples, and some of them could be wave-sized. The
good-behavior rules set in the debate over Tower's drinking habits
and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be
invoked as precedents whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target.
``We've established what will be known as the Tower standards,''
said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
That argument will be used by House Republicans challenging the
financial conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright. But it will be a
debating point, not a turning point, in a Wright controversy that
was ordained long before the Tower episode.
</P>
<P>
While President Bush was unwavering in his support of Tower, he
burned no bridges to congressional Democrats. He insisted that Tower
was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his
choice, even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed. But
he didn't get nasty about it, saying there was no point in
escalating the fight.
``That's over,'' he said 24 hours after the Tower defeat.
``That's history. And now we are going to go forward.''
The 53-47 vote against Tower was a setback to Bush in the sense
that it always is a defeat when Congress denies a president
something he wants. But this denial did not cost Bush a program, or
a major campaign pledge, or the support of voters.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate did the president a
favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon. It
was a break Bush could not make with a political ally who had been
after the Pentagon job since Ronald Reagan was elected president.
</P>
<P>
Tower had not been a Reagan man _ he had supported Bush for the
1980 nomination. And the Reagan White House went to some lengths to
rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new
president would not be nominating any Senate Republican for any
Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his own loyalty, all the
way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safer course would
have been to withdraw the nominee. Tower not only shunned
withdrawal; he offered conditions that had to be humiliating, if
only the Senate would let him have the job.
</P>
<P>
Tower promised to quit drinking, taking the pledge on national
television. And when that didn't work, he offered to become the
first-ever probationary Cabinet member. Republicans proposed that he
get the job for a six-month trial and then return for
reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have changed the system and
could have haunted the presidency.
</P>
<P>
No deal. So Tower became the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be
rejected, the first who was a former senator.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to
appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have
raised the political stakes.
</P>
<P>
Tower did not restrain himself. Battling for the job, he said
withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be ``damning the
president's judgment.'' He said his nomination had been turned into
a vehicle for a major presidential defeat.
</P>
<P>
Tower's advocates on the Senate floor said grave constitutional
issues were at stake, that the authority of the presidency was on
the line, that the Senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the
Tower decision.
</P>
<P>
But Bush said all along that the outcome, either way, would not
hurt on other issues.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the
pivotal figure in the Tower defeat, agreed. He told his Georgia
constituents that the Tower rejection would not hurt Bush's
leadership.
``In Washington, `triumphs' and `setbacks' are short-lived,''
Nunn said, ``and that's particularly true of the president.''

TOWER'S 'MORAL CHARACTER' HIT BY CONSERVATIVE 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a Bush 
Administration Cabinet nominee, a prominent conservative told a Senate panel 
Tuesday that John Tower may lack the "moral character" to be secretary of 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the course of many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition 
- lack of sobriety - as well as with women to whom he was not married," 
conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
"I encountered it frequently enough to the point where it made an impression," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism from Weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to 
temper the panel's earlier praise for the former Texas senator. But several 
members conceded that, while their former colleague may not be the ideal 
candidate for the Pentagon's top job, he probably will win Senate approval 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a surplus of rumors concerning the nominee, and a shortage of 
witnesses with personal testimony and personal knowledge," said committee 
Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation, testified that 
Tower's behavior makes him unfit to lead the Pentagon into an era of 
belt-tightening and management reform. In an extraordinary challenge to Tower's 
nomination, Weyrich also suggested that Tower's moral shortcomings could make 
him vulnerable to attempts by foreign governments "to bring pressure on the 
United States government and on him personally. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unrealistic to expect moral behavior in matters of public trust from 
someone who does not exhibit such behavior in his personal life," Weyrich said. 
"Private morals have public effects." 
</P>
<P>
Tower, 63 and twice-divorced, served 24 years in the Senate from Texas, 
including a tenure as chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1981 to 
1984. He has been dogged by reports that he is a hard-drinker and a womanizer 
and that his hawkish views on defense do not square with the budgetary 
austerity that the Pentagon faces. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing Tower as his choice for the post on Dec. 16, President Bush 
called the talk "a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless." Saying that 
"Nixon went to China," Bush added that Tower's record of support for Pentagon 
spending hikes could be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
But Weyrich's attack raised anew the issue of Tower's fitness for the job, 
after two days of testimony last week in which Tower won broad praise from 
committee members. 
</P>
<P>
Ties to Contractors 
</P>
<P>
Fulbright Institute scholar William C. Jackson Jr. and William G. Phillips, 
president of the Washington-based National Council for Industrial Defense, 
joined Weyrich Tuesday in opposing Tower's nomination. Phillips echoed 
Jackson's complaint that Tower's lucrative ties to defense contractors and past 
support for big defense budgets raise "serious doubts that John Tower is the 
best man for the job . . . at this time in our history." 
</P>
<P>
A leading committee Democrat acknowledged this point. 
</P>
<P>
"I . . . wondered why the President of the United States chose John Tower for 
this job, given the emphasis that he has placed on ethics and the appearance of 
wrongdoing," said Nebraska Sen. James J. Exon. "But the facts of the matter are 
that he has." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), in clarifying the grounds on which Senate 
committees may assess presidential nominees, told witnesses that "it is not a 
function of the Senate to say that this individual, this nominee, is the best 
man qualified." 
</P>
<P>
Weyrich also told the committee that President Bush's transition team "received 
hundreds of letters" opposing Tower's nomination, some of which "contain 
specific allegations of moral impropriety on the part of Mr. Tower." 
</P>
<P>
In a closed session of the committee, Weyrich was unable to add to his own 
observations with more than hearsay, according to Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.). 
Weyrich also acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge of the existence or 
content of the letters. 
</P>
<P>
But the allegation, reviewed in advance by the committee, prompted Nunn and 
Warner, the panel's ranking minority member, to write White House counsel C. 
Boyden Gray asking whether the allegations were investigated by the FBI and 
addressed in the bureau's report to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Wallop, a Tower supporter and a leading Senate conservative, termed it 
"troublesome" that "innuendoes have been made, the insinuations are on the 
table, but the cameras do not record the fact that they are unsustainable." 
</P>
<P>
In open testimony, Weyrich also reflected widespread concerns among 
conservative activists that Tower is not committed to the Pentagon's "Star 
Wars" missile defense program. 
</P>
<P>
"He considers SDI (the Strategic Defense Initiative) a bargaining chip," 
Weyrich said. "We don't." 
</P>
<P>
The panel hopes to complete its deliberations by the end of this week, Nunn 
said, and expects to meet once more today to consider Tower's nomination.

TOWER PROBED ON NEW CHARGE OF BEING DRUNK 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee John Tower, the FBI 
is checking allegations that Tower was recently involved in an episode of 
public drunkenness, sources said Friday - allegations that call into question 
his insistence that he has no current drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
Tower testified in confirmation hearings earlier this week that his problems 
with alcohol are behind him. 
</P>
<P>
But a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, who asked not to be 
identified, said Friday that the new allegation, if true, suggests that the 
former Texas senator's drinking problem "may be ongoing" and that his 
confirmation remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The charge received Wednesday by the committee was very specific, giving the 
date and place of the alleged incident, and was made by an informant who 
identified herself, a knowledgeable source said. The episode allegedly occurred 
within the last year at the Monocle, a Capitol Hill restaurant frequented by 
lawmakers, lobbyists and congressional aides. 
</P>
<P>
Two other allegations under scrutiny by the FBI's special inquiries unit, which 
is working around the clock this weekend on the Tower matter, involve 
assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair 
with an unidentified Dallas woman. 
</P>
<P>
If the new charges should be verified by the FBI, Tower's nomination is doomed, 
an authoritative committee source said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents spent two hours at the Monocle Friday, interviewing the owner, the 
maitre d', bartenders and waiters, The Times learned. The agents were told that 
Tower, when he was in the Senate, "used to drink martinis."

<P>
But one source said that no one on the staff contradicted Tower's statement 
that in recent years he has moderated his once-heavy drinking and now drinks 
only an occasional glass of wine. In fact, in recent weeks, the staff told 
agents, he often has ordered tonic water. 
</P>
<P>
None of the staff could recall any recent incident of improper behavior by 
Tower at the restaurant, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Armed Services Committee had been set to approve the Tower 
nomination, but Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) abruptly canceled the vote because of 
the new charges, which he referred immediately to FBI Director William S. 
Sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of 
Tower, a 24-year Senate veteran who headed the Armed Services panel from 1981 
to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
When he nominated Tower, President Bush said he was "totally satisfied" with 
the FBI check. 
</P>
<P>
No Results Until Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said he did not expect the latest FBI inquiry to be completed until at 
least Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tower Friday refused to comment, as he has throughout the confirmation inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Some Tower supporters complain that committee Democrats are turning the 
confirmation process into a "circus" for partisan political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terribly cruel to a man who's just sort of hanging out there," said 
committee member Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), a Tower supporter. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that "our feeling is simply that we 
believe he will be confirmed but that, whenever there are any new concerns 
raised, they need to be looked into." 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House staff member, who asked not to be identified, said 
Administration officials were getting impatient with the delays in Tower's 
confirmation. "Everybody kind of wants to get our Cabinet in," the aide said. 
"People want to see him confirmed and on the job." 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said that the 
controversy has already hobbled Tower's ability to lead the Pentagon 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole nomination process is going to present a problem for him at the 
Pentagon in terms of running the place," Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
Tower Urged to Withdraw 
</P>
<P>
And two influential defense industry trade magazines on Monday will call for 
Tower to withdraw from consideration for the Pentagon post. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial prepared for Monday's issue, Defense News, a trade paper widely 
read by defense contractors and on Capitol Hill, says: "Withdrawal is necessary 
because the record of Mr. Tower's professional life raises substantive doubt 
that he can perform with utmost effectiveness . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Army Times, another prominent defense community publication, says Tower is 
unsuited for the Defense Department post because of his work as a consultant to 
defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It said that "the speed and greed with which Tower spun through the revolving 
door (between government and industry) is appalling." Tower has said that he 
was paid a total of more than $750,000 by six defense firms in the two years 
after leaving government service. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's profitable consulting work had raised concerns among a number of 
members of the Armed Services Committee but did not appear to threaten his 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Called Morally Unfit 
</P>
<P>
Tower's personal conduct, however, became an issue in the hearings on Tuesday, 
when conservative critic Paul Weyrich charged that the former senator was 
morally unfit for the post because of a history of drinking and womanizing. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy closed session in which Tower was allowed to respond to 
Weyrich's charges, Nunn asked the nominee publicly whether he had a problem 
with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"I have none, senator," Tower replied. "I am a man of some discipline." 
</P>

MAJOR TOWER DISCREPANCY FOUND BY PANEL 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary has 
found a substantial discrepancy in Tower's descriptions of his business 
dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer, congressional 
sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tower testified last week that he had represented British Aerospace Inc. only 
on civil aviation matters, not as a consultant on military systems. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a divorce deposition, taken in June, 1987, Tower stated that he had 
given the company advice on "selling certain systems to the Defense 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
In the deposition, Tower said he represented the firm on a range of military 
programs and was paid $8,000 a month. Records show that the payments continued 
from June, 1986, until December, 1988. Also, he served on the board of 
directors of the company, the U.S. subsidiary of British Aerospace PLC. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns About Veracity 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy, sources said, has prompted concerns about the veracity and 
completeness of Tower's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
And it raises the question of whether Tower should have registered as a 
lobbyist for foreign interests under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's relationships with arms makers are central to reservations expressed by 
some senators about his nomination. Lawmakers from both parties have said they 
are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of 
interest hanging over Tower because of his employment by weapons firms, which 
brought him at least $760,000 in 2 1/2 years - not including the more than 
$200,000 British Aerospace paid him. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Tower has described his lobbying and consulting work for a 
half-dozen U.S. defense firms that do business with the Pentagon. The addition 
of the British firm to the list would add another - and the first 
foreign-based firm - whose interests could pose a potential conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the apparent discrepancy in testimony raises the prospect that 
Tower could be recalled to testify under oath about his work for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Tower aides said they had no comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
A lengthy FBI investigation into Tower's business dealings and his personal 
behavior has stalled a vote by the committee on his confirmation. The FBI is 
looking into new charges about Tower's alleged drinking, womanizing and receipt 
of campaign contributions and has said that it cannot complete the inquiry for 
another 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI is trying to determine whether Tower, who left the Senate in 1985 after 
24 years, received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military 
electronics firm that later became part of Unisys Corp., sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation was raised by a witness in the FBI's massive Ill Wind probe into 
corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that Tower was aware that 
his 1984 campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants 
employed by former Unisys executive Charles F. Gardner, said to be a central 
figure in the Pentagon bribery investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A Unisys spokesman said Friday that the company was conducting an internal 
inquiry into the matter but had found no evidence of involvement by current 
corporate employees. 
</P>
<P>
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and other committee members 
are said to be troubled by these issues and have indicated that they may vote 
against Tower unless the apparent conflicts and questions are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The sworn deposition about Tower's business dealings was never filed in court 
because Tower chose not to contest the divorce from his second wife, Lilla Burt 
Cummings. But the document was obtained by the FBI as part of its background 
investigation of the nominee and is included in the committee's file on Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Tower told the committee in written and oral testimony that he was employed 
only by the American unit of British Aerospace and that he worked chiefly on 
selling the company's commercial jets to U.S. airlines. He said also that he 
advised the firm on U.S. trade legislation and gave opinions on currency 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
Tower told the committee that he could "recall no actions in connection with 
any defense activities" and did not include his income from British Aerospace 
among his earnings from consulting work done for defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
In the divorce papers, however, Tower said that he went to work for British 
Aerospace Inc. on June 1, 1986, eight weeks after resigning as chief negotiator 
in the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reductions talks in Geneva. Around the same 
time, he entered into lucrative consulting arrangements with major defense 
firms, including Rockwell International Inc., Textron Inc., LTV Corp. and 
Martin Marietta Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In the deposition, Tower said that Rockwell paid him $120,000 a year but said 
he was "underutilized" by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
He said he advised British Aerospace on its chances of selling its training 
jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Deposition Cites Weapons 
</P>
<P>
Among the British Aerospace products Tower tried to sell to U.S. military 
officials were the Tornado fighter, the Hawk trainer, the Rapier anti-aircraft 
missile and the Seawolf short-range air defense missile for ships, according to 
the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
He said in the document that he had been valuable to the firm because he was 
"plugged in in this town" and "knows the defense business pretty well." He said 
that his contacts throughout government made him "marketable." 
</P>
<P>
The complex Foreign Agents Registration Act requires individuals working for or 
representing foreign entities in the United States to register with the Justice 
Department. No registration by Tower is on file, officials said. In related 
developments: 
</P>
<P>
 - Vice President Dan Quayle, talking to reporters on a flight to Florida, 
said that he had known Tower for eight years and "I have never seen him 
inebriated. I have never seen drinking be a factor in John Tower's life, other 
than a social glass of wine. . . . Those of us who know him, worked with him, 
can attest to the fact that he has not had this problem, it did not affect him 
when he was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether womanizing is a relevant topic for inquiry, he replied: "You 
have to look at the qualifications of the secretary of defense. Whether he will 
be a capable secretary of defense and do the job of being secretary of defense. 
Let's focus on the qualifications." 
</P>
<P>
 - Tower's doctor said Friday that he has no evidence to indicate that the 
former Texas senator suffered any medical symptoms of alcoholism. Dr. R. D. 
Dignan, who performed surgery to remove a polyp from Tower's colon on Jan. 5, 
said that after the operation he advised Tower to limit his drinking to one or 
two glasses of wine with dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 - A longtime Bush political adviser said that Bush "knew what he was doing" 
when he named Tower to the post and would not withdraw the nomination, despite 
the controversy. As for Tower, this adviser said: "He's one tough little s.o.b. 
and he's not going to back off."

  CRASH KILLS TOWER, 22 OTHERS
EX-SENATOR'S DAUGHTER ALSO AMONG VICTIMS  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Sen. John Tower of Texas and his daughter were among 23 people killed
Friday when the twin-engine commuter plane they were aboard crashed while
trying to land.;    Astronaut Manley Lanier "Sonny" Carter Jr., who flew on a
1989 space shuttle mission and was in training for a shuttle trip later this
year, also died in the crash.  
</P>
<P>
Another victim was Dr. Nicholas Davies, president-elect of the American
College of Physicians, a 60,000-member industry group, said Dr. Louis Felder,
who worked with Davies at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. None of the 20
passengers or three crew members aboard Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight
2311 survived.;    The crash followed by one day the plane-helicopter
collision that killed Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and six other people.;  
Tower, 65, and his daughter Marian, 35, boarded the 30-passenger, turboprop
Embraer 120 in Atlanta and were headed to Sea Island, off the Georgia coast,
for a party in Tower's honor.;    Officials said they did not know the cause
of the crash. The plane was descending in clear weather, authorities said,
when it went down at 2:47 p.m. about three miles northeast of the runway at
the Brunswick-Glynco Jetport.;    Witnesses said the plane appeared to have
fallen straight from the sky.;    "It just went straight down. There was no
cropping of trees," said Lt. Jack Hopper of the Glynn County Police
Department, quoting witnesses.;    "It started in on its nose, and I knew it
was in trouble," said James Griner, who lives a quarter-mile from the airport.
</P>
<P>
"I went to the plane, but I couldn't get to it because of the fire. . . . When
I got to it, it looked compacted.";    Atlantic Southeast's senior vice
president, John Beiser, said officials had no indication from the pilot that
the flight was in trouble.;    Donald Day, the airline's manager of consumer
affairs, described the aircraft as "extremely sophisticated and
fuel-efficient, one of the backbones of our commuter fleet." He said the plane
was new and had been put in service in December.;    The Brazilian-made
Embraer 120 is manufactured by Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA. In 1984,
an Embraer 110 Bandeirante, an earlier model of the 120, crashed in
Jacksonville, Fla., killing 13 people. The Federal Aviation Administration
subsequently ordered an inspection of all Embraers for possible sheared or
worn rivets in the tail sections.;    Tower's death prompted words of grief
and praise among his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, even those who helped
derail his elevation to the Cabinet in 1989.;    "I'm deeply saddened by the
loss of John Tower, a tough, able friend and patriot," said Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, who broke ranks with most Democrats to support President
Bush's nomination of the 24-year Senate veteran to be defense secretary. "He
was intelligent and had independence of judgment.";    Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who led the successful fight against
Tower's confirmation, said: "America had lost a patriot. . . . He fought for
freedom and worked diligently to make the world more secure.";    "It's so
sad," Bush said. "It is a tragic loss."

John G. Tower, conservative Republican senator from Texas,
son of a respected Methodist preacher, boozed it up and
fooled around. His first marriage fell apart; his second made
him miserable. All the while, he preened himself as the first
statewide Republican officeholder since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
John G. Tower wasn't - isn't - St. John the Divine, as
he himself acknowledges with semi-charming candor in
"Consequences: A Personal and Political Memoir (Little,
Brown, 388 pages, $22.95). Did he deserve, even so, public
flagellation as George Bush's defense-secretary nominee?
You would obviously expect Mr. Tower to say no, and he
obliges: volubly and passionately. If that was all there was
to "Consequences," we could scan the dust jacket and invest
our savings in local real estate.
</P>
<P>
"Consequences" reads a bit like a political Stephen King
story as the small senator swelled into a Beltway monster.
</P>
<P>
Politics never has been for the squeamish, but the Tower
controversy leaves a much more disagreeable taste than did
the senator's caperings (which mostly took place in the '70s
anyway). Were the writing less stiff and the narrative
technique less choppy, "Consequences" might have been a
classic case study of late 20th-century politics out of
control.
</P>
<P>
Given Mr. Tower's qualifications for the job -
intelligence, patriotism and past chairmanship of the Armed
Services Committee - the nomination should have sailed
through with flying colors. Instead it sank like the
Bismarck.
</P>
<P>
Clearly and apparently to his surprise, Mr. Tower had made
many enemies since his arrival in Washington in 1961, often
rubbing even supporters the wrong way. The senator from the
Lone Star State could be lordly, in his English-cut suits.
</P>
<P>
Once, meeting with the editors of my newspaper which had
backed him strongly, he thought nothing of tilting back in
his chair, crossing his tiny, well-shod feet atop the
conference table.
</P>
<P>
When the Tower hearings opened, all manner of accusations
came to public notice. The New Right activist Paul Weyrich
claimed to have seen the senator consorting with A Lady Not
His Wife. It was reported that Mr. Tower had chased a
secretary around his desk and had fondled women at Bergstrom
Air Force Base. The second wife, whom the senator had
recently divorced, possessed a repertory of tales she
cheerfully volunteered. At his hotel, Mr. Tower was accorded
that doubtful tribute to instant-celebrity status, the media
stakeout. The nominee issued fervent denials: He drank only
wine, having long since sworn off scotch; he'd never chased
secretaries; his services for defense-industry clients had
been proper and modest. None of the charges, at least on Mr.
</P>
<P>
Tower's showing, proved to have the least substance. No use.
</P>
<P>
Dirt is dirtier than purity is pure, as one of John O'Hara's
characters observes.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn, Mr. Tower's successor as Armed Services
Committee chairman, seemed initially to smile on the
nomination; then the rumor mill started churning and he
changed fronts. While endeavoring to look statesmanlike, Sen.
</P>
<P>
Nunn leaned on moderate Democrats who would otherwise have
supported Tower. Sen. Nunn made the campaign personal, says
Mr. Tower - vote for me or vote for him. Most Democrats, in
the end, went with Sen. Nunn.
</P>
<P>
What was all this about? Morality? Mr. Tower suggests
instead that Sen. Nunn, a presidential hopeful, discovered
and seized an opportunity to show who was really No. 1 on
national defense.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Nunn had every reason to know that the moral and
ethical charges leveled at Mr. Tower, and investigated
exhaustively by the FBI, were flimsy. Yet he waved them about
anyway. When the media retailed lurid and unsubstantiated
stories, Sen. Nunn pursed his lips like a Georgia
Sunday-school superintendent and suggested that a drunken Mr.
</P>
<P>
Tower might accidentally press the nuclear button.
</P>
<P>
"Sam Nunn," Mr. Tower insists, "used the FBI inquiries to
discredit me and to strike at the president of the United
States. The essential chain of good judgment and goodwill
broke down during my confirmation process."
Sen. Nunn has company on Mr. Tower's dishonor roll. There
is Sen. Ernest Hollings ("a study in arrogance and
pomposity"), Sen. James Exon ("one of the most excessive
regular boozers in the Senate") and NBC's Andrea Mitchell
("the most viciously partisan reporter I've ever seen"),
along with the Washington press corps. Sen. John Warner, a
Republican, is depicted as falling all over himself to stay
in good with Sen. Nunn.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tower feels, not without reason, that he was arraigned
on morals charges by cynical colleagues and media personages
whom no one ever mistook for Southern Baptist deacons. "I
don't so much resent my rejection by the Senate," Mr. Tower
insists, "as the way it was done."
"Tower, you were lynched," Mike Wallace, the CBS
correspondent, told him. Worse yet, the lynch mob remains at
large.
