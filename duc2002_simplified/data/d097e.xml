Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with
renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in
southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on
jammed highways.
``This is a disaster staring us right in the eye,'' Mayor Joseph
P. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston,
where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and caused
utility transformers to explode.
``All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have
taken have been sufficient,'' Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in on
the city. ``I just hope and pray we can get through this without any
loss of life.''
By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston. The roof
cracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that has
withstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into the
paneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the command
post was knocked out.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, and
about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of
Palms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135
mph.
</P>
<P>
Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severe
flooding as it moved up the East Coast. The storm posed a 19 percent
chance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hitting
Boston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.
</P>
<P>
As Hugo neared the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach,
200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resort
towns themselves. Power lines and trees were downed in some spots
and water flooded roads. Stop lights and neon lights were knocked
out in Myrtle Beach.
``One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,''' said Amy
Garrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.
</P>
<P>
In Charleston, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs,
palmetto fronds and chunks of bark. Businesses were closed and
classes at public schools and universities canceled. Riley ordered
residents of one-story homes to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients well
enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for
emergency patients, officials said.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state
as of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown,
a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220
miles northwest of here.
``We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side
doors,'' said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at the
Conway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach. ``We tried to post
guards at the doors, but people were still coming in.''
American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling under the number
of evacuees, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., who
appealed for help.
``Right now the Red Cross is sheltering tens of thousands of
people all along the Eastern seaboard. This of course is at the same
time that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and the
other Caribbean islands.
``We're beginning to feel the squeeze. Our resources are very
tight. Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief
operations of the decade.''
At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degrees
north and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said. The
hurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.
</P>
<P>
Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from
125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North and
South Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two
days, according to the hurricane center.
</P>
<P>
The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12
hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said. A hurricane warning
was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on
the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,
which indicated it could cause extreme damage.
``It strengthened more than we thought it would,'' Sheets said,
adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's
tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a
normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m.
``On top of that will be waves,'' Sheets said earlier, and in
many places on barrier islands ``the buildings will be swept clean
off.''

<P>
This historic city has survived the
ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied
300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in
Hurricane Hugo.
</P>
<P>
The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston
Thursday night.
``This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few
people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have
experienced,'' warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
</P>
<P>
Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since
Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, both
natural and man-made.
</P>
<P>
The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore
through the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causing
an estimated $2 million in property damage.
</P>
<P>
Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures lining
quaint streets and alleyways, is where the Civil War began in 1861.
</P>
<P>
The city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any
number of smaller hurricanes, politely referred to by Charlestonians
of refinement as ``September gales.''
But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the
hot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what some
folks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day.
</P>
<P>
The great Charleston earthquake was felt as far away as Chicago
and New York City.
</P>
<P>
Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, the
earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildings
and tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitors
annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine
sand beaches.
</P>
<P>
Charleston has received international acclaim as home to Spoleto
Festival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizers
like to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive arts
festival.

<P>
While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind
roared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watched the fury it vented
on his beloved, 300-year-old city.
</P>
<P>
Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston's
historic City Hall through Thursday night as the area's worst
hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the Civil
War began.
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, there was hope Hugo might spare Charleston. But
the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward
this city, which had survived a number of near misses from great
storms in recent years.
</P>
<P>
From the moment it became apparent Hugo might strike the
Southeast coast, many Charlestonians conceded that, this time, their
number was up.
</P>
<P>
As Hugo's wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the
windows, reporters wandered in and out of Riley's office. On his
desk several candles burned as insurance against the inevitable loss
of power.
</P>
<P>
Later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof ripped
off and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the City
Council chamber. Phone and electric service to the city command post
was knocked out.
</P>
<P>
During it all, Riley kept in close contact with the National
Weather Service. As the eye of the storm passed, he took reporters
onto the porch of the 188-year-old brick City Hall to look at the
damage.
</P>
<P>
The initial view, sketched out in the glow of flashlights, was
unsettling: The tin roof was tossed in the gutter, slate tiles were
scattered on the ground. Bricks, sticks and leaves littered the
street.
``This is the eye of the hurricane. I've never been in one and I
hope I'm never in one again,'' Riley said. ``It's scarcely a late
summer breeze.''
As the storm died before dawn, Riley was out on the streets again
in a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment of
the damage.
``Serious but fixable,'' the mayor concluded.

Forecasting Aided By Supercomputers, But Still An Uncertain Science

<P>
Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of
several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path
Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee
the South Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models
to track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C.
``All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and
forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those
models,'' said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's satellite service.
</P>
<P>
Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but
forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for
evacuation.
``Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea
where Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in a
timely manner,'' said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.
</P>
<P>
The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the
intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane
just hours before it slammed into Charleston.
``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we
don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said.
``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.''
The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute
increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force
reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35
years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools
were reports from aircraft or ships.
``We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our
forecasts were less accurate,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to
obtain a global weather picture. Information from the satellite is
used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that
television viewers see every night.
</P>
<P>
Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the
National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to
the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to
account for current weather conditions and the position of the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze
supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar
storms and the current path of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
</P>
<P>
Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the Massachussetts
Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.
``Congress and the American people are suffering from the
collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by
satellites and that just isn't true,'' Emmanuel said.
</P>
<P>
Satellites can give a ``pretty picture,'' he said, but not enough
information about the wind and temperatures that affect a
hurricane's path.
``Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes
comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very
good job,'' Emmanuel said.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving
every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
``We have to remember that those models used are only guidance
products,'' Pyke said, ``and that it's ultimately the job of the
forecaster to predict the storm's path.''

Residents took forecasters at their word
when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of
deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy
respect, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in
South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which
bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
``We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor Joseph P.
</P>
<P>
Riley Jr. ``Several thousands of people who were in the shelters
and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were
potential victims of injury and death.''
Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the
hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation
warnings.
</P>
<P>
The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in
1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away,
and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's
warnings.
``We've had so many close calls,'' said Gary Garnet, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
``But this storm was very, very strong,'' he said. ``This time
they realized it.''
Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000
residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed
for shelters.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up
Interstate 26 toward Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently
were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the
warnings.
``It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse,'' he said.
``You've just got to say nice things about the people.''
Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary
Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other
storms brewing.
``There's nothing to worry about out there,'' he said.

<P>
It's taken the devastation caused by
Hurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debt
between two cities almost 1,000 miles apart.
</P>
<P>
As a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, Kingston is
raising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.
</P>
<P>
After Kingston, then New York's capital, was burned in October
1777 by the British, New York Gov. George Clinton received a letter
from South Carolina Gov. Abraham Livingston. The letter included
nearly 1,000 New York pounds to help Kingston residents get through
their crisis.
``This money has been received for the charitable purpose of
alleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of the
town of Kingston, who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced to
poverty and want,'' Livingston wrote on March 31, 1778.
</P>
<P>
Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter when
Hurricane Hugo ravaged the Carolinas last week. ``I figured they
helped us, we should do something for them,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a local Red Cross chapter began collecting
donations for victims of the hurricane.
``A lot of people have been calling, asking to send donations
down there,'' said Susan Lawlor, executive director of the Ulster
County Chapter of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, New York state sent two airplanes full of food,
clothing and water to parts of the Caribbean ravaged by Hugo. A New
York National Guard C-5A cargo plane also left Tuesday to pick up
equipment in Mississippi and take it to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
Another cargo plane was scheduled to leave Stewart Air Force
Base in Newburgh, taking 70 tons of food, water and other supplies
to Puerto Rico.

150,000 TAKE OFF AS HUGO TAKES AIM AT GA., CAROLINA; 
HURRICANE'S EDGE TO HIT AT 8 P.M.

<P>
Hurricane Hugo advanced faster and with renewed fury today on Georgia and South 
Carolina as 150,000 coastal residents grabbed what they could carry and fled 
inland on jammed highways. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to take any chances," said Lamar Davis, a bartender on St. 
Simons Island off southern Georgia, who stole a last glance at the pounding 
surf before leaving with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The leading edge of Hugo, whose winds muscled up to 125 m.p.h. from 105 m.p.h. 
the day before, was most likely to hit between Savannah, Ga., and Charleston 
any time after 8 p.m., local time. A hurricane warning was in effect between 
Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m., Hugo was 220 miles from Savannah and bearing down at 20 m.p.h. It 
was expected to turn gradually to the north, according to the National Weather 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Tidal Surge Feared 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a 
dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot tide that 
peaks after 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"On top of that will be waves, and so (on) . . . barrier islands (in) many 
places the buildings will be swept clean off of those islands," Bob Sheets, 
director of the National Hurricane Center, said from Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Evacuees queued up at gasoline stations and stripped store shelves of bottled 
water, bread and batteries. Officials warned coastal dwellers not to linger 
because gale force winds and flash floods could block escape routes. Five to 10 
inches of rain is expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy moved ships out of coastal harbors to ride out the storm at sea. Army 
bases in coastal states moved helicopters inland or into shelters. 
</P>
<P>
In South Carolina, which was in a state of emergency, Gov. Carroll Campbell 
dispatched 400 National Guardsmen to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal 
barrier islands and shorefront. About one-fifth of the state's 3.1 million 
residents live in eight coastal counties. 
</P>
<P>
Resort Streets Deserted 
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, the wind-swept streets of the resort island of Hilton Head 
were deserted. Store windows were fortified with boards and most homes were 
empty. State troopers guarded the island's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"We brought our photo albums and our important papers," said Pat Bross, who had 
stopped for gas while heading from Hilton Head to Augusta, Ga., with her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgia Emergency Management Agency opened shelters and advised about 
142,000 people - more than 95,000 of them in Chatham County - to leave their 
homes. Gov. Joe Frank Harris declared a state of emergency in six counties. 
</P>
<P>
The state's biggest shelters were opened at Georgia Southern College in 
Statesboro, with room for 15,500, and the Veterans Administration Medical 
Center in Dublin, where officials said nearly 19,000 could be housed. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal school systems canceled classes for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of 
strength, indicating that it was powerful enough to cause extensive damage.

HURRICANE HUGO MAY BE MOST COSTLY STORM EVER; 
2 BIGGEST INSURERS IN CAROLINAS ESTIMATING LOSSES AT $600 MILLION 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday 
that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane 
Hugo. Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever 
for the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South 
Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons 
said. The Bloomington, Ill.-based company is also projecting an additional $100 
million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 
million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages 
caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and 
Mississippi in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Our previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in 
comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston. 
There were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm, but there was not the 
severity of damage" as in Hugo, Parsons said. Officials said property damage 
from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and 
then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population 
centers, including Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Losses Still Being Tallied 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in 
North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest 
insurer in South Carolina. "We have so far received 16,000 claims," spokesman 
Bob Sohozich said. 
</P>
<P>
Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little 
doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 
million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck 
Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Information Institute is expected to issue a report Thursday on 
overall insured losses from Hugo. Although the losses are substantial, they are 
not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because 
reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs. For example, 
Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while 
its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages. Reinsurers - which 
share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the 
premium income - typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies, 
which are owned by policyholders, but they noted that losses from Hurricane 
Hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Corp. said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for 
the third quarter, reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm. The 
New York-based company had substantial business in Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands, where Hugo first struck with devastating force. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasts May Be Cut 
</P>
<P>
The charge might push Continental into the red for the quarter, said Udayan 
Ghose, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. "If there is a 
profit, it will be a very small one," he said. The charge will cut expected 
annual earnings by close to 25%, he added. 
</P>
<P>
amp;G Corp. and Lincoln National Corp., which 
are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected 
full-year earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion, 
and analysts expect Hugo to make this year the costliest. But "this could be a 
positive for the industry," Ghose said, explaining that the industry is in the 
middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized. Billions of dollars in 
losses from Hugo and other catastrophes this year would have "a significant 
impact on excess capital," he said, causing insurance firms to raise prices 
shortly.

Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The property claims service division of the American Insurance Service Group, a trade association, is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record," said one official, far surpassing the $752.5 million insurers paid out after Frederick ripped through several Gulf Coast states in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The impact on premium rates could be minimal for now, analysts expect, because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area - for homes and autos. 
</P>
<P>
Most companies typically set aside funds from premiums they collect every year to cover claims they might have to pay in the future. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild, so insurers haven't had to dip into these funds. 
</P>
<P>
And since Hugo also stormed through the Caribbean, foreign insurers are at risk for some of the damage on those islands. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, some analysts believe Hugo's huge losses will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Rates have been falling since late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Udayan Ghose at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. believes these reasons might cause rates to edge higher by mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the losses from Hugo "will be substantial, but they won't be something the industry can't handle," said Charles L. Ruoff, director of strategic planning at Fred S. James 
</P>

<P>
Co., a New York-based insurance broker. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimates it will pay claims totaling more than $400 million to homeowners and for some small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide Insurance Co., a mutual company based in Columbus, Ohio, said Hugo "is the single largest claims disaster" it has seen in its 63-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which is the largest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and No. 3 in South Carolina, has already received 16,000 claims from the stricken region. 
</P>
<P>
Claims could total $100 million, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
For some insurers, Hugo was a double-whammy. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Continental Corp., which is a big insurer in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, said it will take a $50 million pretax charge against earnings this quarter, reflecting its net exposure to the damages caused by the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
"Hugo will be particularly costly to us," said John P. Mascotte, Continental's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which has extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas Hugo hit, and USF
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
G Corp. in Baltimore, a big insurer in the Carolina region, could also be forced to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
G's losses hit very close home - its Charleston office was destroyed by the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
G and Cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge; USF
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
G said it would be responsible for the first $22.5 million of losses, and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo could have a marginal impact on third-quarter income at Travelers Corp., Aetna Life 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., according to industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James believes that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough "financial pain, such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends," to compel them to boost premium rates right away. 
</P>
<P>
He explained that in the first six months of this year, net income for the industry declined slightly from 1988, but insurance companies were still earning an adequate rate of return on equity. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently at $125 billion, is also plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, insurers can book about $3 of premiums for every $1 of surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, premiums total about $200 billion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An official at Nationwide Insurance noted that the company has $1 of surplus for every $2 of insurance that it writes. 
</P>
<P>
Insurers also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Lewis at Dean Witter Reynolds said losses from Hugo could be big enough to "temporarily" increase reinsurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Although reinsurance will limit the exposure of some companies, the losses they must still cover could hurt third-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
Niagara Exchange Corp., based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co. unit faces as a result of the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance. 
</P>
<P>
It believes its reserves are plentiful enough to absorb its losses, a spokesman said.

Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages. 
</P>
<P>
AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today. 
</P>
<P>
Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis. 
</P>
<P>
That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster. 
</P>
<P>
When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.
