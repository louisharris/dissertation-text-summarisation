Kuwait Claims Iraqi Invasion

<P>
Iraqi troops have launched an offensive
against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Faleh Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said, ``We
confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no
comment.''
The attack started about midnight, Kuwaiti time (5 p.m. EDT),
Bader said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Al-Mashat, was
summoned to the State Department afternoon for a meeting with
Assistant Secretary John Kelly.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Kelly repeated to the
Iraqi envoy the U.S. desire for a peaceful solution to the tensions
with Kuwait and urged Iraq to respect to sovereignty of all nations
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kelly told a House subcommittee Tuesday that while the United
States has no treaty obligations that would mandate military
support for Kuwait, the United States does believe strongly in
respect for territories of all states in the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States, whose Persian Gulf naval patrols helped Iraq
defeat Iran in the 1980-1988 war, has six warships in the area.
</P>
<P>
They have been conducting exercises since July 23 with forces of
the United Arab Emirates, some 700 miles southest of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait
after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the
OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's
revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that
straddles the border.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials on Wednesday walked out on talks in Jiddah,
Saudia Arabia aimed at resolving the 2-week-old crisis with
neighboring Kuwait and complained that Kuwait was not negotiating
seriously.
</P>
<P>
Iraq threatened to invade once before, in 1961 after Britain
ended its protectorate over Kuwait. Iraq then claimed Kuwait as
part of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side of
the border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterred
further action by Iraq.

Iraq Invades Kuwait, Says Kuwaiti Gov't Has Been Overthrown

<P>
Tank-led Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait before dawn
Thursday, seizing the ruler's palace and other government
buildings, Kuwaiti officials reported.,
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein said the
Kuwaiti government had been overthrown.
</P>
<P>
The invasion comes nearly two weeks after Iraq massed troops on
Kuwait's border in a dispute over an oilfield and Kuwait's
violation of OPEC oil production quotas, which had kept down the
price of crude.
``The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!'' one Kuwaiti official
shouted in a telephone interview.
``They have seized all administrative buildings, including the
information ministry which houses the (state-run) radio and
television stations,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a
few hours after crossing the border 40 miles away before dawn.
</P>
<P>
The invaders, whose forces far outnumber those of smaller
Kuwait, were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the brunt
of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran. The troops set up
roadblocks at major intersections in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The invaders surrounded the palace of the ruler of Kuwait, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the official said. Residents in the
palace's vicinity said it was seized after two hours of heavy
artillery barrages.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of the emir, whose family has ruled the
city-state for almost 250 years, was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment of ports and airports was vicious, eyewitnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of residents attempted to flee south toward Saudi
Arabia in their cars. Kuwait's official radio broadcast a desperate
plea for help from other Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington reported only that there were
many casualties in the fighting, which follows a flareup in a
protracted dispute over a border oil field, but gave no numbers
early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Residents said there were about 50 tanks around the emir's
palace and the neighboring U.S. Embassy. The embassy did no answer
its telephones.
</P>
<P>
The British Embassy was hit by shellfire and the Sheraton and
Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The air space over Kuwait was closed, with airliners turned away.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration demanded immediate withdrawal of the
Iraqi forces and added that it was ``reviewing all options in its
response to the Iraqi aggression.''
U.S. warships have been on ``short-term'' alert 600 miles
southeast of the Iraq-Kuwait border since July 24 because of the
tensions in the oil-rich Persian Gulf region, scene of heavy
fighting in the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The White House said it had no reports of harm to Americans. The
United States has extensive business ties to Kuwait, and the U.S.
community in the nation _ slightly smaller than New Jersey _ is
sizeable, in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
The White House denounced the incursion, issuing a statement
that said, ``The United States strongly condemns the Iraqi military
invasion of Kuwait ...
``We have conveyed this message to the Iraqi ambassador in
Washington and to the Iraqi government through our embassy in
Baghdad.
``We deplore this blatant use of military aggression in
violation of the U.N. charter.''
In New York, U.N. officials said the Security Council was to
begin an emergency meeting early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reaction was swift elsewhere. The British government said the
``armed incursion is clearly a grave threat to peace and stability
in the area and of immediate concern to the international community
as a whole.''
The Iraqi action was expected to dominate talks between
President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when they meet
later Thursday in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials on Wednesday had abruptly walked out on talks in
Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, complaining that the Kuwaiti representatives
were not negotiating seriously. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
had intervened beginning July 25 to set up the talks in a bid to
cool tensions between the two OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Saddam's government announced Thursday that the
Kuwaiti government had been toppled.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait radio went off the air briefly, but came back on
different wavelenghs with martial music and Kuwaiti patriotic songs.
</P>
<P>
Saddam's ruling council issued a statement from Baghdad saying
an interim government had been established in Kuwait but the claim
could not be immediately and independently confirmed.
``Iraq has responded to the request from interim government of
free Kuwait and decided to cooperate with it,'' the Iraqi statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the troops _ no numbers were given _ were in Kuwait to
defend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people. There was no further
identification of the revolutionary government.
</P>
<P>
Iraq warned too that any foreign troops trying to interfere with
its actions would be attacked.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the country's 1.8 million residents are
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavy
artillery in a failed attempt to repulse them, government officials
contacted by telephone earlier Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi, which is the size of California, has an estimated 1
million troops among its 17 million populace, compared to 20,300
members of the Kuwait armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, the official radio interspersed martial music with
songs with slogans like, ``Greetings to the Revolution in Kuwait.''
The invasion followed massive troop movements to the south on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait early Thursday, the rattle of automatic guns sounded
and explosions in rapid succession shook local residents from their
sleep and the Kuwaiti Cabinet quickly assembled.
</P>
<P>
Residents in downtown Kuwait reported formations of French-made
Mirage jet fighters of the Kuwaiti air force taking to the skies in
the direction of the border region.
</P>
<P>
The streets were empty; some people on rooftops of their houses
reported hearing gunblasts growing in intensity and speed. Moments
later army tanks and armored personnel carriers were moving in the
direction of the Royal Palace, apparently to reinforce the guards.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is a former British protectorate that gained independence
in 1961. Its residents are among the wealthiest in the world
because of the country's vast oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar moved sharply higher along with oil prices
during morning trading Thursday on news of Iraq's invasion.

The British Embassy was hit by shellfire and the Sheraton and

</P>
<P>
Swiss charge d'affaires Franco Bessoni said on French radio that
the palace was taken after bombardment by Iraqi MiG jet fighters.
``You can see black smoke over there .... No one dares to go
out. You can hear gunfire. The entire foreign community is staying
indoors,'' he said.
``It's chaos, military jets are flying over all the time, Kathy
McGregor, a Canadian, said by telephone at about midday. She said
she could still hear artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
The air space over Kuwait was closed, with airliners turned
away. Iraq also sealed its own borders and airspace.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said in a statement that it had ``responded to the request
from interim government of free Kuwait and decided to cooperate
with it.''
It said its troops _ no numbers were given _ were in Kuwait to
defend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people. There was no further
identification of the revolutionary government.

Saddam's ruling council also warned that any foreign troops
trying to interfere with its actions would be attacked.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavy
artillery in their failed attempt to repulse them, Kuwaiti
officials said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The invaders were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the
brunt of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran. Iraq has an
estimated 1 million troops _ including reservists _ among its 16
million people, compared to 20,300 troops in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi radio said 15 army divisions were being recalled and
ordered all men born between 1960 and 1966 to report to the army
within three days.
</P>
<P>
Today's fighting quickly sent oil prices surging in
international markets. The price of North Sea Brent crude for
September delivery was quoted early today at $22.30 a barrel
against Wednesday's London close of $20.40.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, the world's second-largest oil producer, had demanded
higher oil prices at last month's OPEC oil cartel meeting in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Saddam had threatened military action against Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates for exceeding their cartel production quotas
and driving crude prices down. OPEC agreed to cut output to boost
prices.
</P>
<P>
The invasion came a day after talks between Kuwait and Iraq
collapsed in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. Kuwait had apparently refused to
bend to Iraqi demands.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began July 17 when Saddam accused Kuwait of trying to
wreck the debt-ridden Iraqi economy with oil overproduction and
began massing troops on Kuwait's border. He also accused Kuwait of
stealing $2.4 billion in oil drilled from the border oil field,
Rumailah.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also demanded the Kuwaiti island of Bubiyan, which is
opposite Iraq's only outlets to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which reportedly massed about 100,000 troops at the border
on Wednesday, has been engaged in a major defense buildup since
Saddam came to power in 1979.
</P>
<P>
But the Iran-Iraq war left it with a foreign debt of about $70
billion. Iraq borrowed $10 billion to $20 billion from Kuwait wants
that debt forgiven.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait early today, the rattle of automatic guns sounded and
explosions in rapid succession shook residents from their sleep and
the Kuwaiti Cabinet quickly assembled.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet was holed up at the headquarters of the Supreme
Defense Council with telephone and telex links cut off, said
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti radio briefly stopped broadcasting, then went back on
the air on a different wavelength. A speaker believed to be Crown
Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah appealed
for Arab support.
``Oh Arabs, Kuwait's blood and honor is being violated, rush to
its rescue ... the children, the women, the old men of Kuwait are
calling on you,'' the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, nearly the size of New Jersey, is a former British
protectorate that gained independence in 1961. Its residents are
among the wealthiest in the world because of the country's vast oil
reserves.

<P>
Iraq's powerful army invaded this small oil-rich
kingdom early today. Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's
palace and government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia,
Kuwaiti officials said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government
buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the country's
oil facilities. He appealed for U.S. military intervention.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon source said U.S. Navy ships were diverted to the
region, but President Bush said the subject of intervention was not
being discussed.
``The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!'' a Kuwaiti government
official shouted in a telephone interview. Diplomatic sources in
the Persian Gulf estimated that more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed
or wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed it
invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a
coup and established ``The Provisional Government of Free Kuwait.''
Kuwait and U.N. diplomats labeled the coup report a farce.
</P>
<P>
The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and
Iraq, caused by Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a
disputed border area. Saddam also accused Kuwait of exceeding OPEC
production quotas, thus driving down the price of oil, a major
Iraqi revenue source.
</P>
<P>
The attack had wide-ranging ramifications:
_Oil prices soared $3 a barrel in early trading because of fears
the invasion would disrupt supplies. Prices were about $2 higher
later.
_President Bush signed orders freezing Iraqi assets in the
United States and blocking most Iraqi imports, including oil. Oil
accounts for 97 percent of Iraqi imports to the United States and
makes up about 3.5 percent of U.S. oil consumption. Bush also froze
Kuwaiti assets to prevent Iraq from seizing them.
_The Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms supplier, halted weapons
sales.
_The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to denounce the invasion
and demanded immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
_A Pentagon source said the aircraft carrier USS Independence,
escorted by a six-ship battle group, was diverted from the Indian
Ocean toward the gulf, where other U.S. ships were already
patrolling.
_Secretary of State James A. Baker III planned to fly to Moscow
to issue a rare joint statement Friday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze about the invasion. The plan, which was
announced in Washington, illustrates the dramatic improvement in
relations between the superpowers, who once routinely lined up on
opposite sides of most regional disputes.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador, Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, told
reporters in Washington: ``We are desperate for any help we can
get.'' He appealed specifically for American intervention.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000
troops at the border. Kuwait's entire armed forces has 20,300
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Bush said the United States would ``take whatever steps
necessary'' to defend interests in the gulf. Asked if this included
military force, Bush said: ``We're not discussing intervention.''
But he said he would not discuss military options publicly.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in modern history an Arab nation had
invaded another and taken over its government.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq, battle-hardened after eight
years of war with Iran. Iraq has emerged as the Arab world's
strongest and most militant military power, and Saddam has a vast
arsenal of chemical and conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a
few hours after crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the bombardment of ports and military airports by
artillery and the air force was vicious.
</P>
<P>
The invaders surrounded the palace of Kuwait's ruler, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah. Residents said the palace was seized after
about two hours of heavy artillery barrages.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Sheik Fahd al-Ahmed al-Sabah, one of the emir's
brothers, was killed while trying to defend the palace.
</P>
<P>
There were about 50 tanks around the palace and the neighboring
American Embassy, residents said.
</P>
<P>
The al-Sabah family has ruled the city-state for almost 250
years. The Kuwaiti ambassador said the leaders were safe in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Operating from an unknown location, al-Ahmed's government
responded to the formation of the provisional government by
stating: ``Kuwait is Kuwait to its people, let by the emir, Sheik
Jaber, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad. God preserve them from all
harm.''
For its part, the provisional government announced through
Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency that it was dissolving
parliament and would hold ``free and honest elections'' at a future
date.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi forces were led by the elite Republican Guard, which
did the brunt of fighting in the Iran-Iraq war. Troops set up
roadblocks at major intersections and shot at cars that did not
stop.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad television said Iraq qould withdraw its forces within
days or weeks, depending on how quickly the situation stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's land and sea borders were closed, as was the airport.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the
evacuation of nationals, and foreigners were asked to keep a low
profile.
</P>
<P>
There are about 4,000 Americans among the large expatriate
community in Kuwait, where more than 60 percent of the 1.8 million
residents are foreigners. U.S. officials monitoring the situation
had no reports of harm to U.S. citizens in Iraq, White House
spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners reached by telephone said they watched from their
windows or dived for cover as the invasion began. ``We were totally
unprepared,'' said Catherine Baker of Illinois. ``One feels like
there should have been a bit of warning.''
The British Embassy was hit by shell-fire and the Sheraton and
Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The invasion came hours after Iraq broke off talks intended to
mend its differences with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally
Kuwait two weeks ago. Washington declared its support for Kuwait
from the start.
</P>
<P>
During the Iran-Iraq war, American ships protected U.S.-flagged
Kuwaiti tankers from attacks in the gulf.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seemed
determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial
ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The invasion, unprecedented in modern Arab history, reflected
the brutality Saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since
coming to power in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The sentence for criticizing Saddam is death, and the president
considered Kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in
the price of oil a personal affront to Iraq.
``Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better
than cutting means of living. Oh God Almighty, be witness that we
have warned them,'' he said last month after prices tumbled below
$14 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
He accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq
$14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping oil
from a disputed field that straddled their border, and demanded
that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned Iraq
during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Saddam was reported to be incensed that Kuwait was demanding
repayment for the wartime loans. Saddam said he fought the war to
protect the Arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian, mainly Shiite
Moslem Iran.
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Iraq started the war in 1980 by invading Iran
after a series of border skirmishes along the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory, the
long conflict stalled Iraq's development, dragging on for eight
years. It has still not formally ended.
</P>
<P>
The war bills kept the government from delivering material
benefits promised to the Iraqi people directly after the war. The
1990 budget slashed funds for imports and Iraqis were told to brace
for another year of austerity. Private investment has failed to
take hold.
</P>
<P>
Iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt. Its main
gulf port of Basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure
damaged. Tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war languish in
Iranian prisons and an estimated 500,000 Iraqis were killed or
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Despite its puny size, Kuwait's oil reserves almost match Iraq's
100 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
By controlling Kuwait, Saddam could help solve the financial
hangover from the Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstanding
wish for more gulf coastline.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's 100,000 troops massed at the border in the past few weeks
were believed part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulate
to Iraq's demands.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new OPEC quotas and
Saddam's promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he would
not invade lulled the Arab world into the sense the crisis was over.
</P>
<P>
Homage to the cause of Arab unity has been paramount in Middle
East politics since postwar independence from colonial powers.
</P>
<P>
Although a civil war in Yemen in the 1960s brought Egyptian and
Saudi Arabian intervention on opposing sides, no Arab state has
ever directly deposed the government of a fellow Arab League member.
</P>
<P>
Despite Iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition
liberate Kuwait, it has long coveted the tiny emirate.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in
1961 and threatened to attack then, but backed down when Britain
landed troops in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbors along the Gulf. It proved
the decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that groups Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait was
toothless. The GCC did not issue a statement, much less implement
its mutual defense treaty.
</P>
<P>
While Iraq was unlikely to invade Saudi Arabia, it could use the
precedent of Kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy
issues. Bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what
happened to Kuwait when it balked at Iraqi demands.
</P>
<P>
Also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs, the fall
of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
In a series of bellicose statements in recent months, Saddam has
sought to focus domestic attention outside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In March he threatened to burn half of Israel with Iraq's
chemical weapons _ banned under international law _ if Iraq was
attacked. It was a popular stance among Arabs frustrated with the
lack of progress toward peace and a Palestinian nation in the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Then Britain arrested several people on charges they were
smuggling nuclear triggers into Baghdad. Weeks later, police in
Europe impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable of
firing chemical or nuclear shells into Israel.
</P>
<P>
Saddam cried foul, claiming the West was trying to wreck the
scientific progress of the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nassar as the leader of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
His relentless personality cult has dubbed him ``The Knight of
the Arabs.'' For Kuwait on Thursday, he was a dark knight.
</P>
<P>
Asked the reason for the invasion, Kuwait's ambassador to
Washington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah said at a news conference:
``Ambition. Hegemony. Control of the whole area. There is not any
reason for it.''

Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and
Kuwait over oil production and their common border.
</P>
<P>
July 17 _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices
down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf are
conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's
economy and undermine its military buildup.
</P>
<P>
July 18 _ Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of
oil from wells along the disputed border with Iraq and of seeking
to wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down
prices.

July 20 _ Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of
belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _ including Kuwait _
to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
July 24 _ The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navy
warships and aircraft are holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in
the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles
southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait reinstates a state of
alert it declared July 16 and canceled after three days of tension
between the two oil-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
July 25 _ The Iraqi government in Baghdad says that it will not
be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring
Kuwait, and Saddams summons the U.S. ambassador for talks.

Iraqi-Installed Kuwaiti Government Says Withdrawal Under Way
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The radio of Kuwait's new Iraqi-installed
government claimed that Iraqi troops began pulling out of Kuwait on
Sunday, but the United States said it doubted a withdrawal was
really under way.
</P>
<P>
The radio announcement came three days after Iraq invaded Kuwait
and one day after Baghdad said it had replaced the oil-rich
kingdom's ousted monarchy with a new government made up of nine
Kuwaiti army offices.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also said Saturday that it was creating a new Kuwaiti army
and that 100,000 Iraqis, the approximate number of soldiers Baghdad
took over Kuwait with, had volunteered for the new military force.
</P>
<P>
In other developments:
_The White House continued to seek the immediate and
unconditional withdrawl of all Iraqi troops, and it thanked the
many nations who have condemned the invasion and imposed economic
sanctions on Baghdad.
_After several days of debate, Japan on Sunday banned all oil
imports from Iraq and Kuwait and halted Japanese exports to both
countries. Tokyo said it would suspend all loans to Iraq and
Kuwait, ban Japanese investment there, and freeze Iraqi assets in
Japan. Japan, which imports 99 percent of its oil, had relied on
Iraq and Kuwait for more than 11 percent of its oil imports. The
White House hailed Japan's move and said Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu called President Bush on Sunday at Camp David to inform him
about the sanctions.
_Although tens of thousands of Iraqi troops reportedly remained
massed near Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, Washington said on
Sunday there was no indication that any soldiers had moved into
Saudi Arabia.
_The White House said that 11 American oil workers rounded up
after the invasion had been brought to Baghdad, talked with U.S.
</P>
<P>
Embassy officials, and were in good shape. It said that accounts
for all missing Americans.
_An unconfirmed report said a warplane from the deposed emir's
air force in Kuwait bombed an Iraqi military headquarters near
Kuwait city. It was not clear where the plane came from or whether
its reported attack caused any damage.
</P>
<P>
The radio of Kuwait's new government, monitored in Bahrain,
quoted its ``military correspondent'' as saying the pullout began
at 8 a.m. (1 a.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein allowed reporters based in
Baghdad to be taken south to Basra overnight to observe the first
Iraqi troops return home.
</P>
<P>
But at the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said on
Sunday morning: ``We have no independent or confirmable information
on this report (of the withdrawl beginning). Saddam Hussein's
actions in the past have raised serious skepticism about his
intentions.''
Iraq declared earlier that the provisional government installed
by Baghdad is capable of ensuring security in the occupied country.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad television has said the new government is headed by Col.
</P>
<P>
Ala Hussein Ali and that he holds the positions of prime minister,
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, minister of defense and
interior minister. The other eight members were lieutenant colonels
and majors.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwait's embassy in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday dismissed the
new government as ``a list of fake names'' and said Ali is Saddam's
son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
A similar report appeared in one of Cairo's leading newspapers,
Al-Ahram. It quoted the Kuwait Embassy in Tunis which said that Ali
works with Saddam's administration in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency carried a Kuwait-datelined statement it
said was from the provisional government, denying any of its
members were Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, Prime Minister Mudar Badran said his nation will not
recognize the new government because that would hinder Arab efforts
to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
U.S., French and British warships, meanwhile, steamed toward the
Persian Gulf. President Bush said Friday that if Iraq moved against
Saudi Arabia it would be attacking U.S. ``vital interests.'' On
Saturday, Bush said in Washington that the use of force in
resolving the crisis remains an option. Saudi Arabia ships 1.2
million barrels of oil to the United States daily.
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said on Sunday that there was no indication Iraqi
forces had moved into Saudi Arabia, even though tens of thousands
of them have been reported to be within 5 to 10 miles of the Saudi
border.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Iraqi ambassador Mohammed al-Mashat on Saturday
denied U.S. and other foreign reports suggesting that Iraq plans to
invade Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Saddam ordered the invasion of Kuwait after accusing it of
stealing oil from a field that straddles their disputed border. He
also blamed Kuwait for a fall in oil prices that cost Iraq $14
billion, saying it contributed to the oil glut by cheating on its
OPEC oil cartel production quotas.

United State Pushes for Iraqi Sanctions at United Nations

<P>
UNITED NATIONS _ The United States urged other U.N. members at
talks Sunday to impose broad economic and military sanctions on
Iraq. Western diplomats said the world body is expected to adopt
the measures.
</P>
<P>
Should the U.N. Security Council impose comprehensive sanctions,
it would be the first time since 1967 it has taken such action
against a member state. The last time such sanctions were imposed
was against the white minority government of Rhodesia.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said they expected up to 14 positive votes on
the 15-member council for sanctions against Iraq. They said they
expected no vetoes, allowing the legally binding measure to be
adopted, probably on Monday. They said Cuba was the holdout.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told reporters after
closed-door talks Sunday that the council discussed ``the absolute
necessity of moving ahead toward a broad resolution of sanctions.''
He said he expected a vote Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pickering said the United States had circulated six or seven
drafts of a detailed resolution. It calls for an embargo on Iraq's
oil exports, an embargo on imports to Iraq, and a halt to all arms
and other military supplies for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
British Ambassador Crispen Tickell told reporters later that he
detected ``strong support, with the exception of one member, for
action and a vote tomorrow.''
Speaking of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Canadian Ambassador
L. Yves Fortier declared, ``This madman must be stopped.''
Cuban envoy Ricardo Alarcon said Cuba would vote for sanctions
against Iraq only if the council imposed sanctions on South Africa
for occupying Namibia, Israel for occupying Palestinian territories
and the United States for invading Panama.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, the Iraqi-installed provisional government, in a
statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, told other countries to
refrain from taking ``punishing measures'' against it or Iraq. The
provisional government said countries ``have to remember they have
interests and citizens in Kuwait.''
Kuwait's U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Abulhasan told reporters that
the Iraqi-installed government was employing ``pure blackmail'' by
saying it could not ensure the safety of foreigners if their
governments support sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In Aspen, Colo., British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
renewed her call for the United Nations to apply a total economic
embargo against Iraq unless it withdraws immediately from Kuwait.
``Iraq's invasion of Kuwait defies every principle for which the
U.N. stands. If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feel
safe again. The law of the jungle takes over,'' she said, in
remarks at the Aspen Institute.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. role in the Iraq-Kuwait crisis assumed increasing
importance after divided Arab nations cancelled an emergency summit
on the invasion.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion,
demanded immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal, and
threatened to impose sanctions if Iraq did not pull out.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's session was scheduled after weekend meetings of the
council's five permanent members _ the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France _ and between the United States
and representatives of the Non-Aligned Movement. They are the
nations with the power to veto proposals.
</P>
<P>
The United States contends that stiff sanctions by a united
international front are necessary to punish Iraq and to force it to
withdraw from Kuwait, which was invaded Thursday.

<P>
Iraq's powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this 
small, oil-rich kingdom. Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and 
government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in 
the capital and were moving south toward the country's oil facilities. He 
appealed for U.S. military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!" a Kuwaiti government official shouted 
in a telephone interview. Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf estimated that 
more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed that it invaded at the 
request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established "the 
provisional government of free Kuwait." Kuwait and U.N. diplomats labeled the 
coup report a farce. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad television said Iraq could withdraw its forces within days or weeks, 
depending on how quickly the situation stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and Iraq, caused by 
Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area. Saddam 
also accused Kuwait of exceeding OPEC production quotas, thus driving down the 
price of oil, a major Iraqi revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000 troops at the 
border. Kuwait's entire armed forces has 20,300 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in modern history that an Arab nation had invaded another 
and taken over its government. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq, battle-hardened after eight years of war 
with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after 
crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn. Witnesses said the bombardment of 
ports and military airports by artillery and the air force was vicious. 
</P>
<P>
The invaders surrounded the palace of Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al 
Sabah. Residents said the palace was seized after about two hours of heavy 
artillery barrages. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Sheik Fahd al Ahmed al Sabah, one of the emir's brothers, was 
killed while trying to defend the palace. 
</P>
<P>
There were about 50 tanks around the palace and the neighboring American 
Embassy, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
The al Sabah family has ruled the city-state for almost 250 years. The Kuwaiti 
ambassador said the leaders were safe in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Operating from an unknown location, al Ahmed's government responded to the 
formation of the provisional government by stating: "Kuwait is Kuwait to its 
people, led by the emir, Sheik Jabbar, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad. God 
preserve them from all harm." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the provisional government announced through Baghdad's official 
Iraqi News Agency that it was dissolving Parliament and would hold "free and 
honest elections" at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's land and sea borders were closed, as was the airport.

BUSH EMBARGOES TRADE AND FREEZES IRAQ ASSETS 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ASPEN, Colo. 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nation's assets in 
the United States on Thursday while refusing to rule out the use of U.S. troops 
to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders. 
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo bars imports of oil from Iraq, which account for 3% to 4% of 
total U.S. oil supplies, officials said. The move also prohibits Iraq from 
buying U.S. grain and other foodstuffs, which represent the other chief element 
of trade between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's "naked aggression" against Kuwait has created "an emergency in the 
Persian Gulf," Bush said in a speech to the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit 
organization that focuses on global issues. The United States, he said, would 
insist on "immediate and unconditional withdrawal" of Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Bush declared: "We find his 
behavior intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo represents the strongest international response so far to 
Iraq's massive invasion of its small and poorly defended neighbor, but it 
stopped short of the military intervention requested by desperate Kuwait 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Bush Administration sources, the Pentagon stepped up air 
patrols in the Persian Gulf and began moving warships, equipment and supplies 
into the area in a signal to Iraq that the United States would act to halt 
further aggression. 
</P>
<P>
A second executive order signed by the President early Thursday froze Kuwait's 
assets in the United States, a step taken to prevent Iraq from seizing Kuwaiti 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect our friends to stand by us in our time of need," Kuwait's ambassador 
to the United States, Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah, said at a Washington news 
conference. "I think the U.S. intervention at this stage is both paramount and 
important." 
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohammed al Mashat, said Iraq had 
invaded Kuwait in response to a request from the nation's "interim free 
government." He warned the West not to consider "any foreign interference in 
the current events." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's explanation was quickly denounced by the State Department, which said 
Baghdad's claim that its troops moved into Kuwait at that country's request is 
"patent fraud." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the State Department confirmed that invading Iraqi 
troops had rounded up six American oil field workers near the border of Kuwait. 
Their whereabouts is not known. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bush's refusal to rule out military action, it appeared an unlikely 
option given the strength of Iraq's military, the limited U.S. forces in the 
region and the opposition to U.S. intervention from other countries in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Bush Administration's energies are focused mainly on 
organizing international economic and diplomatic pressure against Iraq. Even 
so, the strongest economic weapon, an international ban on Iraqi oil exports, 
also appears unlikely to be employed. 
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who 
is scheduled to give a speech to the nonprofit Aspen Institute on Sunday, Bush 
said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III will discuss the Persian Gulf 
situation with Soviet officials in Moscow today. 
</P>
<P>
In Ulan Bator, Mongolia, where Baker was on an Asian visit, a Baker spokeswoman 
said that the United States and the Soviet Union plan to issue a joint 
statement later today condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on a brief 
refueling stop in Moscow. The meeting was arranged after Baker met with the 
Soviet ambassador to Mongolia, who described the Kremlin's plans for a strong 
Soviet stand on the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, at a news conference in Ulan Bator early today, said there have been no 
reports of U.S casualties in Kuwait and that "the integrity of foreign 
embassies seems to have been preserved so far." 
</P>
<P>
He said the estimate of the number of Iraqi troops in Kuwait varies from 50,000 
to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew to Colorado after meeting early in the morning with his National 
Security Council to discuss the Persian Gulf situation. Originally, the 
President had planned to spend the night in Colorado and return to Washington 
today. Instead, he returned to Washington on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the capital Thursday morning, Bush told reporters at the White 
House that he was "not contemplating" any U.S. military involvement. 
</P>
<P>
But later in the day, at the news conference with Thatcher, Bush moved away 
from that pledge. He said that he had met during the day with top defense 
advisers and "we're not ruling any options out." 
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo imposed by Bush would cut off all commerce with Iraq, except 
news reporting, exports of publications and shipments of emergency relief 
supplies of food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bush, Thatcher has frozen Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets, but she has not 
imposed a trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is highly dependent on oil exports to finance its large armed forces and 
considerable national debt. But Europe and Japan are far more dependent on 
Middle Eastern oil than is the United States, and an international oil embargo 
on Iraq would be painful for many U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
At the joint news conference, Thatcher called for U.N. actions to impose 
additional trade sanctions against Iraq. Asked about an oil embargo, however, 
she stopped short. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to support in the (U.N.) Security Council those measures which 
collectively we can agree to and which collectively we can make effective," she 
said. "Those are the two tests." 
</P>
<P>
Bush spent the day discussing the Iraqi invasion with senior advisers and other 
heads of state, including the heads of Egypt, Yemen and Jordan, Arab leaders 
whom the President described as "friends of the United States." The Arab 
leaders, Bush said, had appealed to him for "restraint" and "a short period of 
time" in which to develop an "Arab solution." 
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed sympathy with the Arab effort but added that "I made clear to 
them that it had gone beyond simply a regional dispute." 
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, the White House said that Bush had spoken with King Fahd of 
Saudi Arabia for about 30 minutes. The statement said the two leaders agreed 
that the invasion was "unacceptable" and "discussed possible options for 
dealing with the situation." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Washington, Kuwaiti ambassador Saud appealed to the 
United States for military assistance. "My people are suffering," Saud said, 
adding that Kuwait is requesting aid "from everyone who has conscience and fair 
play around this world." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Kuwait's request for U.S. military intervention, he said: "We 
don't stand a chance if we don't get aid from our friends." 
</P>
<P>
Mashat, Baghdad's ambassador to the United States, said in a statement given to 
reporters in Washington that Iraq hoped to withdraw its forces within a few 
days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The events currently occurring in Kuwait are an internal affair with which 
Iraq has no relation," Mashat said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States asked Iraq to account for the six missing American 
oil company employees in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Maura Reynolds, Michael Ross and Don Shannon, in 
Washington, and Jim Mann, in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, contributed to this story.

IRAQIS SEIZE WESTERNERS; 
HUNDREDS ROUNDED UP DURING SWEEP OF KUWAIT HOTELS; 
U.N. COUNCIL VOTES BROAD SANCTIONS 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq struck back against the West today, rounding up hundreds of foreign 
nationals in Kuwait, as the U.N. Security Council overwhelming approved 
sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq to punish it for invading 
the emirate. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invaders scoured hotels looking for some of the thousands of 
Westerners based in Kuwait or caught by the invasion. More than 1 million 
foreigners live and work in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans were grabbed in the hotels, 
and some were taken to Iraq, the West German and British foreign ministries 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Britain said Baghdad had given no reason for detaining 366 people, most of them 
passengers from a British Airways flight stranded at Kuwait airport by the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions, which included a ban on oil purchases, came on a vote of 13 
to 0, on the 15-member council. Cuba and Yemen abstained on the resolution, 
which was proposed by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-installed Kuwait government had earlier warned foreign countries that 
they should not forget their citizens in Kuwait while heaping on economic 
punishments, and today's roundup appeared to be a reaction against the 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops rolled into its New Jersey-sized neighbor Thursday, conquering the 
capital and moving south toward the Saudi Arabian border. 
</P>
<P>
Persian Gulf oil sources said today that they had seen Saudi troops moving 
north toward the Kuwaiti frontier near the oil port of Khafji, but the Saudis 
denied that they had sent reinforcements to the border. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi authorities today told Turkey's state-run pipeline company that one of 
the twin pipelines that carry Baghdad's oil through Turkey will be closed "for 
reasons of marketing," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
World oil prices soared to their highest level in more than four years today as 
more countries joined the attempt to strangle Baghdad's economy and force it to 
withdraw its invasion troops. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil revenues totaled more than $11 billion last year. It has been 
pressing for higher oil prices to rebuild an economy damaged by the 1980-88 war 
with Iran and settle foreign debts of up to $80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Iraq gave for invading Kuwait was Kuwaiti reluctance to slow 
its flow of oil and push oil prices higher, but it was Iraqi oil that had 
slowed today. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few tankers loading Iraqi oil at Yumurtalik," a senior Turkish 
government official said, referring to the export jetties on the Turkish side 
of the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, President Saddam Hussein ordered drills for millions of people in 
case mass evacuations were needed. 
</P>
<P>
He warned his nation's 17 million people to be on alert for possible U.S. or 
Israeli attacks. The United States has warned Iraq against any attack on Saudi 
Arabia, and President Bush has said all options are open for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Kuwaitis took to the desert to flee into Saudi Arabia, their 
children and a few belongings crammed into four-wheel-drive vehicles.
