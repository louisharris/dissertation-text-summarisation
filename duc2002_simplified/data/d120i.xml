<P>
John Major, endorsed by Margaret Thatcher as the
politician closest to her heart, was elected by the Conservative
Party Tuesday night to succeed her as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Major, 47, fell two votes short of winning a majority in voting
among the 372 Coservative Party members of Parliament, but his two
opponents quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed Major as
the winner.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11{ years in power, intended to submit her
resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday morning, and Major
would then be called to lead the government.
</P>
<P>
Major, the chancellor of the exchequer, emerged from his
official residence at 11 Downing St. Tuesday night smiling and
holding hands with his wife, Norma. Inside, Mrs. Thatcher, who came
next door from the prime minister's 10 Downing Street residence,
embraced Major. ``I am thrilled and delighted that John Major is to
succeed me,'' the ``Iron Lady'' said in a statement released by
aides.
``It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the
Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow
one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever
had,'' Major said.
``Our job now I think is quite clear. We are going to unite
totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general
election,'' said Major, who will be the youngest British prime
minister in this century.
</P>
<P>
Major received 185 votes, two short of a majority. Former
Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine received 131 and Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56.
</P>
<P>
Hurd and Heseltine conceded within minutes, and party officials
declared Major elected.
</P>
<P>
The party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership
challenge by Heseltine, who last week stopped Mrs. Thatcher short
of victory in the first round of the leadership race.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thatcher had not wanted to leave office, but she decided to
resign last week after she was unable to put down Heseltine's
challenge.
</P>
<P>
She said she resigned to let someone from the Cabinet stand
against Heseltine. Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both
joined the race, but before the vote her aides spread the word that
she was backing Major.
</P>
<P>
The son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare
recipient, Major personifies the values of self-reliance and hard
work that Mrs. Thatcher had preached to the nation.
</P>
<P>
His election climaxed a month of British politics-turned-upside
down, and the Western world's longest-serving head of government
was driven from office by a revolt in party ranks.
</P>
<P>
Heading a government that was trailing the opposition Labor
Party in the polls and suffering a losing streak in local
Parliamentary elections, Mrs. Thatcher lost control of events after
her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
Howe, the fourth Cabinet member to resign because of disputes
over policy toward the European Community, shocked the House of
Commons on Nov. 13 by calling Mrs. Thatcher a threat to Britain's
vital interests.
</P>
<P>
The next day, Heseltine announced he would challenge her. Six
days later, with Mrs. Thatcher at a 34-nation summit in Paris
officially ending the Cold War, Heseltine polled enough votes to
deny her re-election as leader.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, she decided to resign after party leaders told
her she could not win.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, 57, said Major's election ``lays the basis for the
unity of our party.''
Hurd said the party needed to unite, and ``John Major is the
right leader for this task.''
Opposition leaders derided Major's election as ``Thatcherism
with a different face.'' The Conservatives' main rivals, the
socialist Labor Party, demanded a general election.
``John Major is a Thatcherette - that is how he sought election
and that is how he got elected,'' said Labor Party leader Neil
Kinnock. ``It means that the policies that brought the poll tax,
recession, heavy mortgages and rising unemployment will go on.''
During his five-day campaign, Major had aaid he would review the
``poll tax,'' an unpopular local tax brought in by Mrs. Thatcher,
but he gave no other hints of differing with her.
</P>
<P>
While adopting a gentler tone on the contentious issue of
Britain's involvement in Europe, he shares her opposition to a
single European currency and shares her belief in tight restraint
on government spending.
</P>
<P>
However, he insisted over the weekend, ``I am not running as
`Son of Thatcher.' I am running as myself, with my own priorities
and my own programs.''
Major's victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine
to promote himself as a future leader of the party.
``Tomorrow always dawns,'' he said, smiling after conceding
defeat.
</P>
<P>
Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign
secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year.
</P>
<P>
He moved up quickly in the leadership race. By the weekend,
opinion polls showed that Major was nearly as highly regarded by
the public as was Heseltine, who has been prominent for a decade.
</P>
<P>
Major attracted support from figures on the right wing of the
Conservative Party, although his friends insisted Major's own views
were more liberal than many supposed.
</P>
<P>
He described himself as conservative on economic issues but
liberal on social issues.

<P>
Washington, February 28 (XINHUA) - U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, trying to brush aside recent differences with 
London, today stressed Washington's special transatlantic 
relationship with Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Welcoming British Prime Minister John Major in Pittsburgh, 
where major's grandfather and father once lived, Clinton said at 
the airport, "We're working together today to respond to the 
terrible tragedy in Bosnia to try to bring an end to the killing 
and to bring peace and to keep that conflict from spreading." 
For his part, Major said, pressure would be increased for 
the 
peace that every sensitive person wishes to see in that war-torn 
and troubled land. 
</P>
<P>
On Russia, Major said "A Russia that's a good neighbor to 
the 
United States and West would be one of the finest things that 
this generation could hand down to the next." 
Clinton will then share his Air Force One back to the 
nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Major will spend a night at the White House, the first 
foreign head of state to have this honor since Clinton became 
President. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday [1 March], the two leaders will begin their 
discussions on a wide range of issues including Russia, Bosnia, 
Northern Ireland and the world trade. 
</P>
<P>
The two will also discuss Northern Ireland and "what to do 
with NATO," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton and major will meet again in June in Europe during 
the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day of the second 
world war. 
</P>
<P>
Major said Clinton would visit Britain, and perhaps the 
Oxford University, Clinton's alma mater, during the June visit.

[Colin Brown article: "Cabinet Allies Close Ranks But Bring 
Scant Relief to Major"] 
Cabinet ministers rallied behind John Major 
yesterday by insisting there would be no leadership election 
this autumn. But the concerted show of support failed to dispel 
doubts among Tory MPs about his chances of staying in office. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing MPs confirmed the findings in an INDEPENDENT ON 
</P>
<P>
SUNDAY/NOP [National Opinion Poll] poll that Michael Heseltine 
was the favourite to replace Mr Major, if he is forced out. But 
they are calculating that Michael Portillo will run hard to 
secure Eurosceptic policies from the eventual winner. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Mr Major's closest allies were seething with anger 
at 
Mr Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, for "posturing" 
before the damaging retreat last week by the Prime Minister over 
Britain's veto powers in the enlarged European Union. "Why were 
Clarke and Heseltine trying to sound more Portilloesque than 
Portillo? The answer's pretty obvious," said one Cabinet 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership is hoping that over the Easter recess the 
Conservative constituencies will urge their MPs to stop the 
damaging in-fighting which they believe is overshadowing the 
Government's fightback on the economy, law and order and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
That message was reinforced by three Cabinet ministers who 
broke their Easter Sundays to support Mr Major. John Patten, 
the Secretary of State for Education, said: "He is a man of very 
great resilience. It must be tough for him. No one likes the 
level of criticism he has been getting. But he will be carrying 
on a 20- to 30-year programme begun in 1979 through to the next 
general election." 
Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, said: "There is no 
prospect of any leadership contest. John Major is going to lead 
the Conservative Party successfully into the next general 
election." He dismissed one poll of 100 MPs which showed that 
41 of them believed there would be a change of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Lord Wakeham, Leader of the House of Lords, used a letter to 
his former constituency of Colchester South to issue a general 
call to Tories for loyalty to Mr Major. "Our support for him 
should not only be loyalty to a proven winner, but also backing 
for a man who has ideas, ambitions and ability to take Britain 
to success in the 21st century," Lord Wakeham said. 
</P>
<P>
Their calls were described as "ritualistic" by one leading 
right-wing Tory MP. "John Major has done himself great damage. 
</P>
<P>
There will not be a coup next week. It will depend on how we 
do in the local and European elections. But there will be a 
stalking horse candidate this autumn. There's little doubt 
about that," he said. However, Tory right wingers said last 
night that they would support Mr Major because there was no 
credible right-wing candidate. Mr Portillo, 40, was too young 
and they still regarded Mr Heseltine as an interventionist 
left-winger. If a challenge does take place, they will press Mr 
Portillo to stand to secure key commitments, including no 
British entry into a single European currency. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the Tory MPs who have been rumoured as possible 
stalking horses - Teresa Gorman, Tony Marlow and Sir Richard 
Body - appeared to rule themselves out. 
</P>
<P>
The odds against Mr Major surviving have shortened from 
evens 
to 11/10 against over the past 24 hours. The Prime Minister 
told journalists at his Huntingdon Conservative Club at the 
weekend that he would not be forced out by the speculation. "It 
hasn't stopped me in the past two years. It isn't going to stop 
me now."

[Editorial: "There Are Signs of Conservative Party Changing 
Its Leader"] 
In local government elections across Britain 
yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, 
losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats. As the 
ruling party, the Tories took just 27 percent of the vote, two 
percentage points lower than their rating in the polls. The 
results of the local elections showed that the Tories were 
reduced to the third party nationally, behind the Liberal 
Democrats and the Labour Party. 
</P>
<P>
The Labour Party controls 90 local councils, whereas the 
Conservatives only control 13, with a sharp contrast in strength 
between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats had a net gain of 378 seats. Even some 
former Conservative members of parliament announced publicly to 
reporters that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats. Of 
course, this was a measure taken by Tories under circumstances 
of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging 
constituents, who resent the Tories, to vote for the Liberal 
Democrats rather than Labour. 
</P>
<P>
In the deep sorrow of defeat, some Conservatives are 
secretly 
feeling happy. They resent John Major's leadership, and would 
most willingly link Major's incompetence and lack of vision with 
the bitter defeat in the local elections. Even before all of 
the results were known, some Tories openly announced their 
determination to challenge John Major's position and remove him 
from office as early as possible. The right-winger Michael 
Portillo added salt to the wound by starting a dispute over the 
European issue, and highlighted John Major's image as a loser 
who fails to command. Obviously, all of these actions were long 
planned and are aimed at making John Major suffer an even 
greater defeat in the European Parliament elections scheduled 
for 9 June. 
</P>
<P>
Before 9 June, nobody will officially challenge for the 
position of party leader. But he who is in office must suffer 
the pain of electoral defeat. After 9 June, John Major will 
have to answer for all of the disasters, and it is time to use 
him as a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
John Major is someone who was propped up by Mrs. Thatcher, 
who supported appointing the mediocre John Major as her 
successor when she was utterly isolated so that one day she 
would be able to pull strings from behind the scenes and 
continue to pursue the Thatcher line. Nevertheless, people 
around John Major seriously pushed him to betray Thatcher's 
doctrine, while pursuing entirely new "leftist" policies and 
affecting John Major's moves. 
</P>
<P>
For a very long period, right-wingers and left-wingers 
argued 
over many domestic and world issues. John Major has always been 
weak and powerless, and vacillates to the left and to the right 
resulting in his own "crisis of honor." On the European issue, 
he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty, 
cultural traditions, and life-style of each country of the 
future European Union, while reflecting the islanders' mind set. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, he expressed the will to join the European 
family; on the other, he made one big stride closer to the 
right. While great skill is needed to have one's bread buttered 
on both sides, John Major has been relatively stupid in such 
circumstance. When expounding on such concepts, he set out a 
campaign to "return to basic values," with an emphasis on 
citizen self-discipline, taking social responsibility and 
obligations, and being upright. However, one scandal surfaced 
after another in his cabinet; consequently, British citizens saw 
how bombastic Major could be and how he failed to know himself. 
</P>
<P>
The scandals caused Major's reputation to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, John Major has failed to resolve the 
economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of 
British people, who have become poorer with each passing day and 
suffer from a high rate of unemployment. At this critical 
juncture, John Major went back on promises made during the 
election campaign by increasing value-added tax on domestic 
fuel; as a result, things became even harder for the poor. He 
promised to reduce public expenditure, but on the contrary, it 
rose by 45.5 percent. [as published] John Major has become an 
expert in making "empty promises," while constituents continue 
to scorn this dishonest prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Many Conservatives believe that John Major is driven by a 
gambler's mind set. At a time when his reputation was waning, 
he wanted to start an offensive in the arena of difficult world 
issues, regardless of British national strength. This being the 
case, he wanted to try his luck in Bosnia, as well as policy 
toward China; however, he was helpless in dealing with domestic 
economic issues which would only lead Britain to an impasse. It 
will be difficult for John Major to lead the Tories in the next 
general election; therefore, news spread earlier this year that 
John Major would be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
The setback which has resulted from defeats in the local 
elections is heavier than expected. To accelerate a leadership 
reshuffle, Conservatives have spread the opinion that "John 
Major is not up to his office." 
However, if politicians 
from various factions compete for office by taking a 
laissez-faire attitude, the Tory unity will be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
This being the case, a planned transfer of power, especially 
the reorganization of the cabinet and the replacement of the 
party chairman, is necessary. When the new party chairman is 
elected, the question of who will replace John Major will be 
settled too. Word has spread that John Major wants Chris Patten 
to become Conservative Party chairman; however, this proposal 
was rejected. That should have been a party secret; making 
public such an inside story would only provide evidence of 
political reality, namely, many Conservatives did not agree to 
Chris Patten contending for this position. There are no grounds 
to allow a politician who has lost a previous electoral campaign 
to canvass votes in the next one under unfavorable electoral 
circumstances. That would only aggravate the Tory's poor image 
as a party which enjoys little public support and has few 
talents. In actual fact, should John Major set out such a line 
in appointing people, that would only give more evidence of his 
poor ability, insight, and lack of judgment, as well as his 
self-knowledge. Now, it is just a matter of time until he 
leaves office; but nobody will let him make arrangements for the 
transfer of power. Work to seek a new leader will be conducted 
by veteran Tories; how can John Major be qualified for such a 
task?

FT  08 APR 93 / John Major's Year: Major's blue period - A year on from
success at the polls, the prime minister's popularity has plunged. He still
has a great deal to prove
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by
winning the general election. His honeymoon, after a very personal victory,
was short-lived and now he begins the second year of his hard-won term as a
deeply unpopular leader who has everything still to prove.
</P>
<P>
The past 12 months have been hijacked by internal party differences over
Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange rates
mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep
recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory
supporters in business.
</P>
<P>
Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political
point-scoring over the government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader of
the Commons, conceded: 'No one pretends that the last year has been easy,'
he also claimed that much had been achieved. The government's efforts to
secure a framework for long-term prosperity was beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was joined by 10 frontbench colleagues in
launching a counter-attack, involving a detailed and documented indictment
of Mr Major's failures. He attacked the Tories for building 'a bonfire of
pre-election commitments'.
</P>
<P>
Tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense
pressure, though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as
recession ends. Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation
of British Industry, remained cautious but volunteered: 'If I were a betting
man I would say we have the embryo of a recovery.'
Mr Major can take little comfort from the conclusion, widespread among
industrialists, that his greatest achievement in the past year has been
Britain's withdrawal from the ERM - something which he resisted and over
which, in the end, he had no control.
</P>
<P>
Most industrialists, however, find it hard to criticise Mr Major as an
individual, with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal
qualities and those of his predecessor. He still attracts gratitude for the
election victory, which was seen - despite subsequent problems for the
economy - as the best result for business.
</P>
<P>
But, unlike the previous No 10 occupant, he is seen as a weak leader, with
little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction.
</P>
<P>
There is a general perception that, important though Britain's future place
in Europe is, the prime minister has been excessively preoccupied with
community affairs and associated internal party ructions, to the detriment
of the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
Many industrialists are pleased that Mr Major is now attempting to reshape
economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base. But the jury is out
on whether the rhetoric will give way to effective action.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Hawks &#60;amp; Handsaws: A few blunt words
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty
language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised
some people. It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime
minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in
which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to
communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good.
</P>
<P>
With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may
undergo correction.
</P>
<P>
What piffle. Major is a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the
wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a Conservative majority
of 23,015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16,427
majority for the Liberal Democrats. Fifteen months too late, the voters of
Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury.
</P>
<P>
In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty
when chatting in private than when speaking in public. In public, they have
to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible
mattness. But in private they relax. Their syntax disappears. Their words
become nonsensical. They swear and joke and shout. It really is a spectacle.
</P>
<P>
To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith.
</P>
<P>
Smith, a Scot, is leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know
that. In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lost its deposit, I
wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee them privacy, I used a signal-scrambler. No one could have
eavesdropped. Their responses were true to form. But I have left out the
swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the
gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged . . . Four-letter
expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review (Arts)
pages.' I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive
any dispensation is a puzzle.
</P>
<P>
First, I tackled Major. I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard,
Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and
Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week? They were
describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate
arrangements. They did not pull their punches. I bet you went chalk-white.
</P>
<P>
'So why not walk the plank, John? You are the most unpopular prime minister
since the start of the fourth century. Why invite more punishment? Unfairly
or not, you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone
the cock-ups.'
'Are you sure?' the prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . how did it come
about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load of . . . let me put
it to you - the economy, of course . . . I mean, wimpy guy like me. But I'm
not giving in like that, like . . .'
On and on it went. Then I rang John Smith. I told him I had been impressed
with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which
he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever
gets elected), including a referendum on proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
I said: 'You are starting to raise your game, John. Many people will have
agreed with your assertion that democracy in Britain is decaying, and that
the Tories must be roasted for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency
and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation of power and the
elimination of opposition'. But some of your critics still accuse you, John,
of laziness and ineffectualness. What do you say to that?'
'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted the Labour leader. 'Gie me o'wit an' sense
a life, behint a kist to lie an' sklent. Our Stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, a
clever, sturdy fellow, but then he was sae fley'd by his showther gae a
keek, an' tumbl'd wi' a wintle. Likewise with political and constitutional
reform, Michael, for by the L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll
laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, as lang's I dow]'
After that, I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of
the Liberal Democrats, to solicit his views on Christchurch. But I couldn't
raise the energy.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Major additions and omissions: Dominic Lawson on a prime
minister who has invented himself
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being
old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was
Being There. I entirely concur with their choice.
</P>
<P>
In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the
plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises
without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the
US presidency.
</P>
<P>
Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a
halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers
that he is a sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear
what they want to believe. He has a deadly innocence. No wonder the Majors
liked this film.
</P>
<P>
John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his
own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's. If he did not see
the similarity, that is still more revealing.
</P>
<P>
Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an
unknown fact: his father was once a farmer.
</P>
<P>
Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy
with agriculture'. (Well, it was obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And
Major replied: 'It's simple. My father was a farmer. He lived on a small
farm somewhere in Shropshire.'
Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past,
immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed
near Bromsgrove in 1910.
</P>
<P>
As Wheen pointed out, Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that
time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire. This, of
course, does not mean that Major made everything up. Family folklore is a
peculiar thing.
</P>
<P>
Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a
few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel
industry, as part of his American tour. I recall that he made a great hit by
recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city. A farmer for
Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience . . . a
pattern emerges. Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major
himself, can be all things to all people.
</P>
<P>
If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point
barely worth making. But it does seem all of a piece with Major's approach
to wider political issues.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by
claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe. On the other he is
free with insulting references to the European Commission, whenever it is
necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics.
</P>
<P>
There are those who will argue that this merely means that Major is a
typical democratic politician, that one who wants to become prime minister
in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest, not just one.
</P>
<P>
But that has not been true of Major's most recent Conservative predecessors.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too was
Edward Heath, even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus
politician'. No, Major's technique is very much his own invention, very much
a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his
unsettled family background.
</P>
<P>
His father, Tom Major-Ball, was an itinerant figure, moving from place to
place, trying his hand at any number of occupations, including the circus.
</P>
<P>
No wonder the young John Major learned the skill of fitting in with
prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating.
</P>
<P>
The only problem is the old one: you cannot fool all of the people all of
the time. Except in the movies.

THATCHER HEIR ELECTED; 
TREASURY CHIEF JOHN MAJOR TO BE NEXT PRIME MINISTER 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her 
successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and 
will become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Major fell two votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded 
defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said Thatcher is "thrilled." Major, 47, her chancellor of the Exchequer, 
is the youngest person to be elected Britain's prime minister since the 19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and 
particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders 
the Conservative Party has ever had," Major said. 
</P>
<P>
He called Thatcher "a very great prime minister indeed." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher has made no public comment on what she will do next. She could 
continue to represent Finchley in the House of Commons, enter the House of 
Lords, write her memoirs or enter business. 
</P>
<P>
"Our job now I think is quite clear. We are going to unite totally and 
absolutely and we're going to win the next general election," said Major, who 
emerged smiling from his residence at 11 Downing St. 
</P>
<P>
Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had 131 votes 
and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in a secret ballot election 
among Tory members of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-class campaign, fought 
without rancor or bitterness, which I believe lays the basis for the unity of 
our party," Heseltine said moments after the vote was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd also quickly conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative Party committee 
that supervised the election, announced that another ballot was not required 
and that Major was elected. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher left her residence at 10 Downing Street to congratulate Major, who as 
chancellor of the Exchequer is her next-door neighbor at No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II will send for Major and ask him to form a Cabinet after 
Thatcher has handed in her seals of office at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and 
then chancellor of the Exchequer last year. 
</P>
<P>
He attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing of the 
Conservative Party, although his friends insisted that Major's own views are 
more liberal than many supposed. 
</P>
<P>
He described himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Major epitomized the self-reliant, hard-working achiever whom Thatcher 
encouraged. Born March 29, 1943, the son of a circus performer, he left school 
at 16 and was a laborer and at one time a welfare recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Major became a banker and a Conservative Party activist and was elected to 
Parliament in the first Thatcher victory of 1979. He was appointed to a junior 
ministerial post in 1985, then to the No. 2 position at the Exchequer in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He emerged as a possible heir-apparent when Thatcher appointed him foreign 
secretary in July, 1989, and then chancellor of the Exchequer three months 
later.

JOHN MAJOR, 47, A THATCHER PROTEGE, WILL LEAD BRITAIN; 
POLITICS: HE WILL BE CENTURY'S YOUNGEST PRIME MINISTER. CONSERVATIVES' CHOICE 
ENSURES PARTY UNITY. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Major, the 47-year-old chancellor of the exchequer who rose out of one of 
London's toughest neighborhoods and the unemployment line, was selected Tuesday 
as Britain's next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Major, whose father was once a circus trapeze artist, was elected leader of the 
Conservative Party to replace Margaret Thatcher, whose sudden resignation under 
pressure last week surprised the nation. Thatcher formally presents her 
resignation today to Queen Elizabeth II, who will then ask Major to form a new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives' choice of Major, a Thatcher protege, came after a battle 
pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership, former 
Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The 
three-way race took shape last week when Thatcher, stunned by Heseltine's 
strong showing in the first-round voting for party leader, resigned. 
</P>
<P>
In the secret, second-round balloting among the 372 Tory members of the House 
of Commons on Tuesday, Major got 185 votes - two shy of the total he needed 
for an outright victory. But as party members began preparing themselves for a 
Thursday runoff between Major and Heseltine, the runner-up, both Heseltine, 
with 131 votes, and Hurd, with 56, threw their support to Major. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said she was "thrilled" by Major's victory, adding that he was her 
personal favorite among the three contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Major becomes Britain's 18th prime minister and the youngest in this century. 
</P>
<P>
His election ensures the unity of the fractured Conservative Party, which now 
has become the favorite to defeat the opposition Labor Party in the next 
general election. Before Thatcher's resignation, the polls had been favoring 
Labor. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing outside his official residence at No. 11 Downing St., next to the 
prime minister's, Major declared Tuesday evening, "We are going to unite 
totally and absolutely, and we are going to win the next election." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and 
particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders 
the Conservative Party has ever had," Major said. 
</P>
<P>
He complimented his rivals for a campaign based on "substance, not 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
When the results of Tuesday's vote were announced about 6:20 p.m., both 
Heseltine and Hurd said that they would vote for Major in the scheduled third 
runoff ballot on Thursday and advised their supporters to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders, however, waived the third ballot - which was expected to be 
unanimous - and Major was declared party leader. 
</P>
<P>
After his appointment by the queen today, he is expected to name his Cabinet in 
a few days. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, en route to Washington after a visit to Mexico, telephoned 
Major from aboard Air Force One to congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
"The President said he looked forward to working with Major and to maintaining 
the special relationship" with Britain, said White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State and Defense departments also welcomed the news. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very glad that it's all settled, and that it was able to be settled so 
quickly," a State Department official said. "We know John Major and expect to 
work well with him. We don't expect any change in U.S.-U.K. relations." 
</P>
<P>
After Major's election, Thatcher declared that she wanted everyone "to rally 
behind him." The prime minister had picked Major from among "backbenchers" - 
those who are not party leaders - as someone to watch several years ago and 
regarded him, aides said, as "a man of the people." 
</P>
<P>
With her support, he rose swiftly through the Department of Social Security and 
then the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher will remain a member of the House of Commons, representing the 
Finchley section of London. She and her husband, Denis, will move out of 10 
Downing St. today to their house in the South London community of Dulwich. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher may accept a peerage in the House of Lords as a hereditary countess, 
friends said, since earldoms (the male equivalent) are the traditional award to 
former prime ministers. That tradition was not followed by recent Labor prime 
ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Major is a high school dropout who made his name in banking before winning a 
seat in the House of Commons in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
He has few enemies and is regarded as a leader who can unify the party and, 
associates said Tuesday night, lead the Tories to victory in the next election, 
which must be held within 18 months, at a time of the party's choosing. 
</P>
<P>
He is not expected to introduce any major new policies but will take a more 
sympathetic view toward Britain's role in the European Community and has 
promised to review the controversial community charge, the so-called poll tax 
introduced by Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who likely will face Major in the next 
national election, immediately labeled him "more of the same" in the Thatcher 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party had expected to defeat an unpopular Thatcher in the next 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Cunningham, Labor's campaign coordinator, argued that Major's victory was 
that of the "Thatcher candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham pointed out that 187 members of Major's own party, a majority in the 
House of Commons, voted against him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
That in a sense was true. 
</P>
<P>
With 185 votes in the three-way race, Major did not gain as many as the 202 
votes Thatcher won Nov. 20, when Heseltine was her sole opponent. That vote - 
while she was in Paris attending the summit meeting of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe - forced her into a runoff with Heseltine 
and ultimately cost her the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But in that vote, under the party's complicated rules, she needed a majority 
plus 15% and she fell four votes short. In Tuesday's ballot, only a simple 
majority was needed to win outright. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's downfall came after she had run into a stretch of 
unpopularity - partly through her authoritarian manner, partly because of 
inflation and high interest rates and partly because of her unpopular new "poll 
tax." 
</P>
<P>
She also appeared to take an anti-European attitude toward her 11 partners in 
the European Community, which caused her long-serving Cabinet colleague and 
deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, to resign and deliver a witheringly 
critical resignation speech. 
</P>
<P>
That speech led Heseltine, who had walked out of the Cabinet in 1984 in a 
dispute over how to aid of a defense contractor, to challenge Thatcher for the 
leadership in that first ballot last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's failure to gain the necessary majority forced her to 
reassess her position. Her closest advisers reported that her support in the 
House of Commons was eroding, friends said, so she decided to resign rather 
than risk the humiliation of a defeat at the hands of one of her own 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, on Thursday morning, both Major and Hurd, loyal members of her 
Cabinet, entered the race against Heseltine. 
</P>
<P>
Many Tories in Parliament were angry at Heseltine for his role in bringing down 
Thatcher, who had won three national elections during her 15 years as 
Conservative Party leader. 
</P>
<P>
Her 11 1/2-year tenure as prime minister was the longest in this century. Her 
confrontational style of leadership won her many admirers at home and abroad - 
and many enemies, here and in the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, Major picked up strength among his colleagues, as 
opinion polls showed him to be the next most popular Tory after Heseltine 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Thatcher let it be known that she personally preferred Major to 
succeed her. 
</P>
<P>
Some commentators feared that Thatcher's revelation of her choice might harm 
Major - with her comment Tuesday morning that she would make a "good back-seat 
driver." Labor members called Major "Mrs. Thatcher's poodle." 
</P>
<P>
But Major was the clear-cut victor in the balloting, held from 11 a.m. to 6 
p.m. Tuesday in a House of Commons committee room. 
</P>
<P>
After the results were announced, Heseltine declared that the election had been 
fought "without rancor and bitterness." To "lay the basis for unity," he said, 
he would ask his supporters to vote for Major in the expected third ballot on 
Thursday, as he himself would do. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, Hurd did the same. 
</P>
<P>
A third ballot seemed certain until Cranley Onslow, who heads the Conservative 
Party organization called the 1922 Committee, which supervised the party 
election, announced that another ballot would not be necessary and declared 
Major the party leader. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether Hurd and Heseltine would join Major's 
Cabinet, though Major's aides indicated they would be offered roles in the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party members of all hues were elated by the result and by the 
fact that the short campaign was conducted in the most gentlemanly fashion, 
with no blood on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party, almost overnight, went from being the strong favorite in the 
next election to second place behind a Tory party led by Major. Recent opinion 
polls had suggested that any new leader would greatly enhance Tory popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's Cunningham declared that the Conservatives' lead was "a temporary blip" 
and promised "to fight an election as soon as he (Major) names a date." 
</P>
<P>
TORY ELECTION RESULTS

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TAKES HARD LINE ON IRAQ 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major said today that Iraqi troops will have to be 
"forcibly removed" from Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to 
withdraw them peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
Major, just as unyielding in talking about Hussein as was his predecessor, 
Margaret Thatcher, rejected the notion that a partial Iraqi pullback from 
Kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"A complete withdrawal is necessary, a partial withdrawal won't do," Major said 
in a display of solidarity with U.S. policy on the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
On the gulf issue at least, Major's remarks augured well for his talks with 
President Bush late in the day at Camp David, the Maryland presidential retreat 
where the two leaders were planning an overnight stay. 
</P>
<P>
Major, who arrived here Thursday night for a 40-hour visit, wasted no time in 
going on a rhetorical offensive against Hussein, using a succession of four 
television interviews aired shortly after dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"If he stays in Kuwait, in a country which essentially at the moment is rather 
like a prison camp, a country that he's dismantling day after day, then he will 
have to be forcibly removed," Major said. "I hope it won't come to that - 
everyone hopes it won't come to that - but it could." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Major demonstrated the kinder, gentler face he has brought to 
British politics since his accession, showing none of the abrasiveness that was 
a Thatcher hallmark. In contrast to Thatcher, he was polite to reporters 
questioning him. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing Major and Thatcher, one U.S. official said, "The biggest change is 
personal style." 
</P>
<P>
Consistent with the U.S. view on the gulf, Major said: "There is nothing 
whatsoever to negotiate about." Hussein, he said, "has to go."
