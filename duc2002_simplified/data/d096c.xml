San Francisco Beats Cincinnati in Super Bowl
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a dramatic finish, the San Francisco 49ers
football team won the Super Bowl on Sunday with a 20-16 victory over
the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34
seconds left provided the winning margin.
</P>
<P>
The victory was achieved through the brilliance of Montana and
Jerry Rice, the wide receiver who caught 12 passes for 222 yards,
both Super Bowl records. Rice was named the game's most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
The winning score came at the end of a 92-yard drive, engineered
by Montana, whose touchdown pass gave him a Super Bowl record with
357 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth straight win for a National Football Conference
team, but by far the most dramatic _ the previous four had been by
an average score of 41-14.
</P>
<P>
It also gave 49ers Coach Bill Walsh his third Super Bowl win.
</P>
<P>
The game was a defensive struggle in the first half, which ended
in a 3-3 tie. Two key players were injured in the first 14 plays,
Cincinnati's All-Pro nose tackle Tim Krumrie and San Francisco's
tackle Steve Wallace.
</P>
<P>
The first touchdown didn't come until 44 minutes into the
60-minute game, when Cincinnati's Stanford Jennings took a kickoff
93 yards for a score.
</P>
<P>
The game, before a crowd of 75,179 at Joe Robbie Stadium, went
undisrupted by racial tensions in Miami.

Bush Meets With 49ers
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush congratulated the San Francisco
49ers on Friday and said they ``rewrote the record books'' with
their Super Bowl victory. In turn he was presented with two
autographed balls and a jogging outfit.
``Let me congratulate you also on your victory,'' quarterback Joe
Montana told Bush at a East Room reception. Montana said being
invited to the White House ``means a lot to all of us'' and joked:
``Not very often do I get to see these guys in ties.''
Bush, surrounded by 49ers, told the team, ``With this, your third
Super Bowl title in eight years, you rewrote the record books and
raised the game of football to a new level of excellence.''
And, to Montana, who drove the team to the winning touchdown on a
92-yard drive late in the fourth quarter, Bush said: ``Joe, you once
again showed your grace under pressure. I guess we all wonder why it
took so long.''
Bush was presented autographed balls by both Montana and wide
receiver Jerry Rice, who won the game's Most Valuable Player award.
``That's the real thing from the Super Bowl,'' Rice said of the
ball he gave the president.
</P>
<P>
Bush joked that he heard, ``there is a new TV series coming out
based on your Super Bowl performance _ Miami Rice. Available in
every city in the country except one. Cininnnati, that is.''
The 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, two weeks ago in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
Team owner Danny DeBartolo told Bush that he would be presented
with a Super Bowl ring, size 11, ``because we want to make you an
honorary member of our team.''
And outgoing coach Bill Walsh gave Bush a 49ers jogging outfit,
but cautioned, ``I'm not sure we suggest running in the streets of
Washington, D.C., in this suit....Remember the Redskin fans are all
around us.''
Super Bowl winners are traditionally invited to the White House.

Miller, Anheuser-Busch Super Bowl Campaigns Tagged At $7 Million-Plus
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The beer gridiron is going to be a busy and
expensive place on television this January.
</P>
<P>
The nation's two largest brewers, Anheuser Busch Cos. Inc. and
Miller Brewing Co., are gearing up to sell their beer with by
staging mock football games in television commercials in
conjunction with Super Bowl XXIV in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
Executives from both companies say they're attempting to take
advantage of the weeks of hype surrounding the game. Both
beermakers claim their packages are the largest Super Bowl
promotions ever, with each planning to spend upwards of $7 million.
</P>
<P>
Anheuser Busch is staging a ``Bud Bowl II'' ad campaign that
culminates during the Jan. 28 Super Bowl, with a game featuring
animated teams of Budweiser and Bud Light beer bottles rattling
around on a pint-sized football field. The first such game was
staged during the last Super Bowl.
``We're starting a month earlier, we've added an extra promo
spot and we're going to have a lot more display materials in the
stores,'' said Tom Sharbaugh, group brand director for Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
Miller, based in Milwaukee, won't say exactly how much it is
spending on its 12-week, pre-Super Bowl campaign centered on a
football game between a ``Tastes Great'' team and a ``Less
Filling'' squad.
</P>
<P>
Those teams will be made up of current and former National
Football League players such as Bert Jones, L.C. Greenwood and Joe
Klecko.
``We're spending more than $7 million, I can tell you that,''
said Richard Burton, advertising manager for Lite beer. ``We're
talking about real-life talent.''
Miller's campaign culminates Jan. 14, two weeks before the Super
Bowl, primarily because Anheuser Busch bought all the Super Bowl
television spots allocated for beer advertising.
</P>
<P>
Miller's television commercials already have started airing.
</P>
<P>
Anheuser Busch will begin its ads this week with a spot featuring
sports announcer Brent Musberger.
</P>
<P>
Both companies also have fan participation promotions.
</P>
<P>
Anheuser Busch expects to receive 400,000 to 500,000 scorecards
from fans who are being asked to write down the score of the Bud
Bowl after each quarter. Fans who send in their scorecards will
receive a commemorative pin.
</P>
<P>
Miller has a consumer sweepstakes offering expense-paid trips to
the Super Bowl.

San Francisco Routs Broncos in Super Bowl
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers routed the Denver
Broncos 55-10 Sunday in the most lopsided Super Bowl victory ever.
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' win in the 24th Super Bowl made them the first repeat
NFL champion in a decade and tied the Pittsburgh Steelers as a
pinnacle of Super Bowl perfection with four wins in four tries.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco won the National Football League championship game
in 1989, 1985 and 1982. The Broncos, on the other hand, lost the
last four Super Bowl games they have played.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana made five touchdown
passes, three to Jerry Rice, breaking a Super Bowl record for
touchdown passes on a day on which he also set a record with 13
straight pass completions.
</P>
<P>
He also set five Super Bowl career records, including his third
Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award and San Francisco's point
total was the most ever. Montana left the game with nearly 11
minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
In four Super Bowls, he has thrown 11 touchdowns and no
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
For Denver quarterback John Elway, it was a day of futility,
ending with his third Super Bowl defeat. He missed eight of his
first 10 passes and was intercepted twice and fumbled once.
</P>
<P>
By halftime the score was 27-3. With their third loss in four
years, the Broncos have now been outscored 136-40.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco was boringly perfect, doing more than even the
experts who made them favorites by nearly two touchdowns after a
14-2 season and a waltz through the playoffs.

Super Bowl Was Lowest-Rated in 21 Years
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers' 55-10 rout of the
Denver Broncos was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in 21 years and the
third-lowest ever.
</P>
<P>
The game on CBS averaged a 39.0 rating and a 63 share, the
lowest Super Bowl rating since 1969, when the New York Jets' 16-7
victory over Baltimore got a 36.0 on NBC for the worst rating ever,
A.C. Nielsen Co. said today.
</P>
<P>
The rating is a percentage of the nation's televisions; each
point represents 921,000 homes. The share is the percentage of the
televisions on at the time.
</P>
<P>
Despite the low rating, Sunday's game was seen by about 108.5
million people, making it the ninth most-watched TV show ever in
the United States behind eight Super Bowls and the final episode of
``MASH.'' The higher viewership was made possible by the annual
increase in the number of homes with television.
``Given the expected blowout, the numbers are completely
understandable and we're happy to have a 39,'' said Susan Kerr,
director of programming for CBS Sports. ``It's still a remarkable
rating for prime time.''
The 49ers won by the biggest margin in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
Only the 1969 and 1968 Super Bowls had lower ratings; Green
Bay's 33-14 victory over Oakland in 1968 got a 36.8. The first
Super Bowl was in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The highest-rated Super Bowl was in 1982, when the 49ers' 26-21
victory over Cincinnati got a 49.1 on CBS.
</P>
<P>
Last year's San Francisco-Cincinnati Super Bowl, won by the
49ers 20-16, got a 43.5 rating and was seen in 39.3 million homes,
according to Nielsen estimates. This year's game was seen in about
35.9 million homes.
</P>
<P>
Viewership of the 5 p.m. game this year peaked at a 41.6 rating
and a 69 share from 6 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., dropping off as it became
clear that Denver would not rally.
</P>
<P>
The pregame show got a 39.0 rating and a 63 share and the
postgame show got a 22.5 rating and a 35 share.
</P>
<P>
The musical ``Annie,'' which was on ABC opposite the game, got a
9.4 rating. ``Life Goes On'' on NBC got a 6.0 rating and ``Love
With a Twist'' on NBC a 7.6.

SUPER BOWL TOPS ON TV BUT CBS STILL LAGGING 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched television event of the week, viewed by a 
whopping 63% of TV viewers, but not even Joe Montana could lift CBS out of the 
cellar in the ratings race, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
CBS estimates that 109 million viewers saw all or part of the game, down only 2 
million from last year despite the fact that this year's match was a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
On the upside for CBS - Super Bowl XXIV carried enough of its audience over to 
the debut of the new series, "Grand Slam," to provide a good audience sampling 
and give the action show a ranking of 15th for the night. 
</P>
<P>
It was CBS' bad luck that the game was so predictably lopsided, which resulted 
in the lowest rating since Super Bowl III in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Each rating point in 1990, however, represents many more households than it did 
two decades ago. Technically, Super Bowl IV in 1970 out-rated Super Bowl XXIV, 
39.4 to 39.0. But last Sunday's game had almost twice as many viewers as the 
estimated 59.19 million who watched Kansas City beat Minnesota 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This also marks only the third time that the network airing the Super Bowl did 
not win the week - NBC managed it in 1979 and 1981. It also is only the second 
time the Super Bowl network was third for the week - dating back to NBC in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos were not to blame for all of CBS' troubles last week. The network 
tried some stunting, most of which did not work. On Monday it ran a popular 
theatrical movie, "Cocoon," which tied for 54th. The big winner was the 
American Music Awards on ABC, which came in 10th for the week.

ROSE BOWL BIDS FOR SUPER BOWL; 
FOOTBALL: IN PROPOSAL FOR 1993 GAME, THE L.A. SPORTS COUNCIL WILL OFFER 
INCENTIVES TO NFL, INCLUDING RENT-FREE STADIUM USE. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose 
Bowl in 1993, will offer the stadium to the National Football League rent-free 
in a proposal next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Council, which represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in 
trying to bring major sports attractions here, also will offer the NFL all 
income from concessions and the sale of novelty items. 
</P>
<P>
Competing against the Rose Bowl are San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Rose Bowl has 102,083 seats, the council selected it as the prime 
venue. Under a joint agreement, the Coliseum and Anaheim Stadium did not submit 
competing bids, but they would share in the revenues if Pasadena gets the game, 
said Ed Aghjayan, Pasadena's deputy city manager. "The bulk of the revenue 
would go to the Rose Bowl, but the idea is that we would share with the 
Coliseum and Anaheim," Aghjayan said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the split are still being negotiated. One plan calls for the Rose 
Bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds, with the two other facilities sharing 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena earned $300,000 from the 1983 Super Bowl and $800,000 in 1987, the 
money coming from stadium rental fees, concession sales, admission taxes, 
charges for use of a hospitality tent compound and parking fees. In addition, 
the city was allowed to buy 1,200 tickets at face value for local distribution 
by directors and other city officials. 
</P>
<P>
But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has 
taken more of the income, Aghjayan said in a report to the city's Board of 
Directors. In most parts of the country, the stadium is offered rent-free in 
exchange for the benefits to local economies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal for the 1993 game, the city would give up most of the 
previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the NFL. It also would provide 
350,000 square feet of space for the league to build a hospitality tent 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
The city would receive about $79,000 from seat taxes, $75,000 in hotel and 
sales taxes arising from the event and a share of about $55,000 in parking 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
The board has approved the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl, meanwhile, has proposed an $8.3-million project to renovate the 
press box and restructure about 1,000 seats for club seating, with an adjacent 
lounge, restaurant, hall of fame museum and gift shop.

  THIS TIME, THE ENTIRE CITY OF TAMPA IS INVOLVED
IN THE HOOPLA  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Carley lives on the west side of town, a couple of miles from Tampa
Stadium. The last time the Super Bowl was played there, in 1984, he felt as
distant from all the hoopla as if he were 1,000 miles away, he recalls.;   
Carley, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, had no interest in
being inside the stadium.  
</P>
<P>
Things are different;  He says he only wished the black community could
have shared in some of the considerable profits generated by one of America's
greatest sports events.;    "The Super Bowl is about money," Carley said last
week. "And last time we were basically onlookers.";    Things are a lot
different this time around. This year, Carley is the co-chairman of one of the
featured events of Super Bowl week, the Bambaleo Parade, a Saturday
extravaganza with marching bands, a street festival and floats.;    The grand
marshal of the parade will be Lee Roy Selmon, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneer.;  
Other events will include a salute to black sports legends and a Doug
Williams golf tournament.;    'Much more involvement';  This year, the Super
Bowl Task Force, a group headed by two of the city's most influential white
businessmen, named two black men to head a community-relations committee.;   
But perhaps most important, Carley said, several minority-owned businesses
have won lucrative contracts from the NFL for the game.;    "There's much more
involvement this time, black and white," said Carley, who is the
affirmative-action officer for Hillsboro Community College.;    "There's been
a heightened awareness. In 1984, there was not even a thought given to a black
man.";    About 100,000 visitors, many of them corporate and political movers
and shakers, were expected to arrive in Tampa this week for the festivities
leading up to the game Sunday.;    The game itself, which is televised to 750
million people around the world, is only part of an event whose impact on a
city has been compared to that of a national political convention.;    Hotels,
restaurants and other businesses are anticipating an estimated $125 million in
revenues, with a total economic impact of $200 million.;    'It's a bay
window';    "The Super Bowl introduces you to the world in a big way," said
Barbara Casey, the coordinator of the Super Bowl Task Force. "You don't have
to say Tampa, Fla., anymore.";    The Super Bowl also can highlight a
community's problems, and bring the frustrations of many of its members to the
surface.;    "It's more than a window into a town," said Jim Steeg, director
of special events for the NFL. "It's a bay window.";    Last month, NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would stand by his recommendation to move
the 1993 Super Bowl out of Tempe, Ariz., because the state does not have a
holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King.;    A week before the Super Bowl in
Miami two years ago, the fatal shooting of a black man on a motorcycle by an
Hispanic police officer in the predominantly black Overtown neighborhood set
off three days of looting and torchings of buildings and cars.;    While the
disturbances were not caused by the Super Bowl, the NFL was criticized at the
time for not making enough of an effort to include minority-group members in
the festivities.;    "I think Miami was the awakening for a lot of people,"
Carley said.;    In Tampa, Super Bowl XXV brought about the cancellation of
what was the biggest annual event in the city for 86 years: the Gasparilla
Parade, an extravaganza that featured 500 of the city's most powerful men
swaggering through the streets dressed as gun-toting pirates.;    Tampa
officials made the parade part of their pitch to the NFL for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
But after Tampa was awarded the 1991 Super Bowl, a racial dispute erupted over
the parade, which always has been sponsored and organized by an all-white,
all-male private club, Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla.;    The club's top
officials refused the demands of a coalition of black residents, including
Carley, that the club be integrated immediately. Instead, they canceled the
parade.;    The Super Bowl Task Force had to scramble to put together a new
parade, and Carley became the co-chairman of that effort.;     SUPER BOWL
XXVI; Super Bowl XXVI will be played Jan. 26, 1992, in the Metrodome. It will
be Minneapolis' first time as the host city. The last time the Super Bowl was
held in a cold-climate city was in 1982, when the 49ers beat the Cincinnati
Bengals 26-21 in Pontiac, Mich.

Sports Illustrated is taking 300 advertisers to Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, Calif., this weekend for an all-out bash. 
</P>
<P>
Along with getting seats for Sunday's game, the guests will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant, take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the 104,000 fans attending the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining - from an executive sitting in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs. 
</P>
<P>
One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted. 
</P>
<P>
If a company purchases a a 50-yard-line seat for $1,500 - the going rate - it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value, or $60. 
</P>
<P>
Even to get the 80% deduction, there still must be a "substantial and bona fide business discussion" before, during or after the game, says Julian Block, a tax specialist at Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
To take a client to a game as merely a good-will gesture is no longer enough, Mr. Block says. 
</P>
<P>
And if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game, the business gift carries a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient. 
</P>
<P>
The tougher IRS rule, however, hasn't slowed ticket demand; even end-zone seats are fetching $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it weren't tax deductible, it'd be worth it," says Tom Foley, chairman of Bibb Co., a Macon, Ga., maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the National Football League team logos. 
</P>
<P>
Bibb is flying about 20 people - mostly customers - to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We get more earnings from the trip than the expense," says Mr. Foley. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies say they are making adjustments or at least educating their executives about the new rules.

Co, the Golden, Colo., brewery, said its tax advisers instructed executives that "this can't be just a fun trip - we have to discuss business." 
Air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible, as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game. 
</P>
<P>
Meals are now 80% deductible as long as business is discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old law, meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest. 
</P>
<P>
Companies can get a 100% deduction for a pre-Super Bowl banquet, since the new tax law has a "banquet meeting exception." 
Such meetings must have at least 40 persons, half of whom are away from home, and there must be a speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the Super Bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor, says William J. Lipton, tax partner of the accounting firm Ernst

</P>
<P>
If a host wants to deduct 80% of the bill, he or she must talk business with all of the guests, Mr. Lipton says. 
</P>
<P>
One safety measure: Make a business-oriented speech, Mr. Block suggests. 
</P>
<P>
He also advises party hosts to keep a guest list and note their business connection. 
</P>
<P>
That will be a big job for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp., who along with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, is holding a pre-Super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1,800 guests including business leaders, entertainment personalities and customers. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Hermansen, a Hilton senior vice president, says the bash is tax deductible because "our sales people will be there and business will be discussed." 
He admits, however, "We're not going to twist any arms. 
</P>
<P>
We're there to say thank-you to those who've given us business." 
An IRS spokesman says more agents will be assigned to corporate audits of business-entertainment expenses this year. 
</P>
<P>
But IRS enforcement of the rules could be as difficult as blocking the New York Giants' Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"As a practical matter, as long as people say they talked business at a Super Bowl party, how can the IRS dispute it?" says Vickie King, a Price Waterhouse tax official. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who will get into trouble are those who don't keep receipts."
