Slain Beatle Portrayed as Reclusive, Anorexic
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Lennon spent much of a three-year span
tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position
with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to
a biography of the slain Beatle.
</P>
<P>
An excerpt from the book, ``The Lives of John Lennon'' by
journalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15
issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering
portrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono.
</P>
<P>
The book is scheduled to be published later this month by
William Morrow 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes, Lennon ``could not be
more remote.''
Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including
time spent with his son, Sean, ``Lennon is back here in his room,
alone and silent.''
The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life
as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as
perfection. The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965,
Goldman writes, ``when some fool described him in print as the `fat
Beatle.' ''
``That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the
wound has never healed.''
Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless
slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
The 719-page biography also details Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-week
heroin habit in 1979. She reportedly snorted the drug.
</P>
<P>
According to the book, Lennon also took heroin and consumed a
great deal of LSD.
``I must have taken a thousand trips,'' the book quotes Lennon
as saying. ``I just ate it all the time like candy.''
Goldman spent more than six years researching the book,
interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, who
was murdered eight years ago in New York.

Yoko: Goldman's Lennon Bio `Totally Fiction'
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A biography that portrays John Lennon as a
drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to
New York City is ``totally fiction,'' Yoko Ono said in a national
radio broadcast.
``It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license. I don't
see John in there ... It's a very dramatically described something,
but it's not about John,'' Ono said Wednesday night in her first
broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.
</P>
<P>
The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter
Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' which presents the
ex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his
wife.
</P>
<P>
As for Ono, Goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snorted
heroin up to the time of Lennon's death. Goldman also charges she
was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan,
had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a
divorce as Lennon.
</P>
<P>
Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered
through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that
Goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.
``It's totally fiction,'' Yoko said during the hour-long
program, which opened with Lennon's song, ``Gimme Some Truth,'' and
coincided with the book's national release Wednesday.
``These people in this book are not us. It's not John and me,''
Ono continued. ``It's unfair he's been assaulted and can't hit
back. ... For some reason this book is attempting to rob both John
and I of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to.''
The Ono interview was taped Aug. 28 at the Dakota, where the
Lennons lived _ and Yoko still lives with their son, Sean. Lennon
was murdered by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota on Dec. 8,
1980.
</P>
<P>
The interview was broadcast nationwide via the Westwood One
Network; spokeswoman Laurie Wilde said an exact figure on how many
stations picked up the broadcast was not available.
</P>
<P>
Also appearing were Sean and Lennon other son, Julian. Ono was
interviewed by longtime associate Elliot Mintz, who is described in
Goldman's book as a spy for Yoko _ a charge Mintz denied during the
show.
``It is, for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies,
untruths ... The whole thing is just sickening,'' said Julian, who
also refuted Goldman's tales of Lennon as a violent father.
</P>
<P>
Mintz read excerpts from the book to Yoko, who then responded to
the allegations point by point. She denied that Lennon was
homosexual; that he was using drugs while living at the Dakota with
his son, Sean; that he had become a reclusive rock 'n' roll Howard
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late
1970s, but rejected Goldman's assertion that she had a
$5,000-a-week habit.
</P>
<P>
The book has already drawn angry responses from friends of
Lennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involving
Lennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a boycott of
the book.
</P>
<P>
After Yoko's rebuttal, listeners were invited to dial 900-digit
telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate
portrayal of the Lennons' life. Results were not expected until
later today.
</P>
<P>
Goldman, who conducted more than 1,200 interviews for his Lennon
book, has written controversial biographies of comedian Lenny Bruce
and Elvis Presley.

<P>
When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began
digging into ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' his first move was to
mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.
``She was Numero Uno, you've got to start with her. I sent her a
sincere letter, because at that time I was a true believer in
rock's greatest love story. ... I told her, `I'm in your corner,'''
Goldman recalled.
</P>
<P>
Ono never responded. And after 1,200 interviews and 6{ years,
the dream was over for Goldman, his mythic view of Lennon the Great
altered.
</P>
<P>
Expecting the best, Goldman claims to have uncovered the worst:
a volatile, debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes of
rock 'n' roll, tucked in his Dakota bed for days at a time.
</P>
<P>
That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters,
family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it also
taught Goldman _ who says he is a John Lennon fan _ a hard lesson.
``It doesn't pay to meet your idols. Just enjoy them; don't try
to see the reality,'' Goldman said. ``My books are a cold dose of
reality. You get in the Beatle shower, and suddenly the water goes
cold.''
Goldman, whose past tell-all biographies dealt with Elvis
Presley and Lenny Bruce, remains unmoved by the hue and cry from
the music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, Paul
McCartney.
``My books are bad for business,'' Goldman said in a phone
interview from Munich, West Germany. ``They're bad for Paul's
business, bad for Yoko's business, back for the jive myth of rock
business. Those people have to hate me.''
Myth-shattering is a not a bad thing, Goldman said. For example,
he cites Lennon's disillusioning meeting with Presley at Graceland
in 1965.
``John was very hooked into Elvis. Elvis was his measure of
success,'' said Goldman. ``And the myth of Elvis: awesome. But the
reality of Elvis: a mess.''
Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney,
Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame
because he's no longer around to answer the allegations.
``You can't say John lacks for defenders. And Yoko isn't dead.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Parker (Presley's manager) isn't dead. Ninety-five percent
of the people in my books aren't dead. They can do something about
it,'' said Goldman, his voice quickening.
``This business of making it easy for defending myself is
insane. I'm the target of scores of attacks. I can't imagine a
harder thing for an author.''
Those attacks don't really bother him, unless they come from
someone who hasn't read ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' Goldman said.
``A lot of people already made up their minds. They hear Albert
Goldman, John Lennon, homosexuality _ bang, let him have it! I
resent people commenting on a book they haven't read, including
Yoko,'' the author said.
</P>
<P>
Ono's reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to the
book. She labeled Goldman's version of life with the Lennons
``totally fiction'' and brought out Lennon's sons, Julian and
12-year-old Sean, to refute the biography.
``These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honest
documentaries, when they're in-house documentaries,'' said Goldman,
who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show. ``She takes no
chances. This was another no-chance Yoko.''
As for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse by
Yoko and John, wild drinking binges, anorexia and reclusiveness,
Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennon
presented by those who knew him.
``My thesis is John Lennon was a divided mind. Every yin had a
yang,'' said Goldman. ``There is nothing more natural than for John
to try the other side (sexually). That's just the kind of guy he
was. He wanted to try everything once.''

Former Wife of Late Beatle Also Denounces New Lennon Bio
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cynthia Lennon joins the throng denouncing the
new, unauthorized biography of her late former husband, John
Lennon, as written by a money-hungry author capitalizing on
untruths.
``People who write books like this, it is for greed, and as far
as I'm concerned, they're gravediggers, no more, no less,'' Mrs.
</P>
<P>
Lennon says on the CBS show ``60 Minutes'' scheduled for broadcast
Sunday evening.
``Grave robbers, body snatchers, you name it, they are it.''
The biography by Albert Goldman, ``The Lives of John Lennon,''
depicts the former Beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs
who raged his way from Liverpool to New York. It was released Sept.
14.
</P>
<P>
Goldman, who defends his Lennon book and said it is based on
1,200 interviews, also has written controversial biographies of
comedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
Lennon was murdered outside his Upper West Side home on Dec. 8,
1980, by Mark David Chapman.
``All I know and all the people that love John know that we had
our years (and) that nobody, no film, no book will ever complete
what went on in our lives. That's our part of our hearts that has
to stay with us, must not be public,'' Mrs. Lennon said.
``I love John. I've always loved John because he was my first
love. But, I mean, I've loved him in different ways. I love his
memory. I loved what he did. I understood his madness, his phases.
</P>
<P>
I just feel that I understood.''
The couple divorced a few months before Lennon married Yoko Ono
in 1969.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Ono already has trashed the book, calling it ``totally
fiction'' in a nationwide broadcast that coincided with the release
of the book. She too was interviewed on the ``60 Minutes'' show,
entitled ``The Two Mrs. Lennons.''
``These people in this book are not us. It's not John and me,''
Ono said in the taped radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Cynthia and John's son, Julian Lennon, also denounced the book
on the radio taping, calling it ``lies, untruths,'' and adding that
``the whole thing is just sickening.''
Sean Lennon, the son of Yoko and John who is now 12, added his
voice on the CBS broadcast, rebutting charges that his father was
inattentive to parenting.
``I think he did a lot of fathering in the five years that I
knew him,'' Sean says. ``He spent so much time with me not just at
home, but everywhere, you know.''

Watching the new movie, ``Imagine: John
Lennon,'' was very painful for the late Beatle's wife, Yoko Ono.
``The only reason why I did watch it to the end is because I'm
responsible for it, even though somebody else made it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Cassettes, film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie
were collected by Ono.
</P>
<P>
She also took cassettes of interviews by Lennon, which were
edited in such a way that he narrates the picture. Andrew Solt
(``This Is Elvis'') directed, Solt and David L. Wolper produced and
Solt and Sam Egan wrote it.
``I think this is really the definitive documentary of John
Lennon's life,'' Ono said in an interview. ``What John was really
about is depicted in this film, very accurately and without
whitewashing.
``I did view it. I didn't have them take any footage out.
``I wanted the truth. In the sense you had to put a 40-year life
into an hour and a half; balance is a very serious consideration. I
think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so.''
There is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments
primarily by Lennon, tied in with the film and using the same title.

``Imagine'' is more than a Lennon elegy. Though it fails to
delve too deeply into the darker side of Lennon and the Beatles
(drug use, abusive tempers, manager Brian Epstein's death), it does
capture the music and the times in which Lennon lived.
</P>
<P>
One intriguing episode in ``Imagine'' shows cartoonist Al Capp
(``L'il Abner'') being antagonistic toward the Lennons during their
bed-in, when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their
concern for peace.
``We were naive,'' Ono said. ``A lot of things happened because
we were naive. Maybe that was our strength. To us, Al Capp was just
a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal, with
a sense of humor. We didn't expect hostility.
``Al Capp is one incident that was filmed. In those days we did
numerous interviews because of our stand for world peace. ... There
were some very rough interviews. The hostility that was shown to us
bluntly by reporters in those days was incredible. Each time, I
think we were hurt.''
Ono said Lennon wrote the song ``Imagine'' in 1969 or '70. ``We
did the bed-in, the Toronto Peace Festival, the `War's Over'
billboard. He was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept
of world peace. I think it's one of the songs that will really go
on forever in people's minds.''

<P>
Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940. He was shot and killed outside his
Manhattan apartment on Dec. 8, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Ono was a painter when Lennon met her. She later joined him in
music and in public demonstrations for peace.
``I think that for somebody like me, because I feel that I'm an
artist and a creative artist, that it is a very strange turn of
events that I'm known as a widow,'' she said.
``But it is stranger to me that I'm not that disturbed by it. I
think that John promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow
it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a
context of a partnership with him. ... I think it is my turn to
promote him. He promoted me.''
When Albert Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon'' was published
in September, depicting the former Beatle as riddled with vices,
faults and neuroses, Ono called it ``totally fiction.''
Since then she's received a tremendous amount of support from
friends and fans. ``I was very touched and thankful that people
sent letters to me and extended hands at this time, very warmly. I
really appreciate that. I was also surprised that so many people
stood up against it (the Goldman book). I didn't expect that,'' Ono
said.
</P>
<P>
Lennon's half sister, Julia Baird, also has written a new book,
``John Lennon, My Brother.'' She has no idea how many books have
been written about Lennon; she's been sent some of them but hasn't
read them. ``I know the life and it is too painful to read somebody
else's version.''
There's still enough footage, Ono said, for another movie _
perhaps a music or political or art film. And there's another big
John Lennon project on her horizon.
``It's from unpublished songs which were written for a Broadway
musical. I don't know if it would have gotten to Broadway. You aim
for the stars, you know. The songs might be strung together. They
might become a record, might eventually become a musical. There are
enough finished songs. They were never recorded in the studio.
</P>
<P>
They're on cassettes.''
Their son Sean, 13, like his older half-brother, Julian, has
become interested in music and started playing guitar.
``I had reservations about Sean going into the music field. I
still do. But I kind of gave up on it,'' Ono said.
``He is into guitar now. A session musician, a very good one,
was teaching him. According to this teacher, it seems like he is
very good. He is just totally involved in it, listening to Eric
Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, his dad's songs _ only for guitar playing, I
think.
``He is into it so much, good luck to him.''

Life With John Lennon And Mummy
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The image of a dour, shoeless English boy
and his absent, carefree mother prompted Julia Baird and Geoffrey
Giuliano to collaborate on a book.
</P>
<P>
The boy is the public image of young John Lennon, Baird's
half-brother and Giuliano's idol. But the neglected urchin and his
live-it-up mother _ who was also Baird's mother _ never existed, the
authors say.
``That woman laughing, singing, dancing, saying goodbye to John,
and John standing there alone crying `Mummy, Mummy!' That's not my
brother, that's not my mother, that's not my children's
grandmother,'' said Baird, who recently spent three weeks in the
United States promoting her book, a family portrait of Lennon and
his Liverpool roots.
</P>
<P>
Published in North America last fall, ``John Lennon, My Brother''
was co-authored by Giuliano, a Beatles aficionado who lives in this
Erie Canal city about 25 miles north of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
The two-year, cross-Atlantic collaboration came from two
different motives. Giuliano wanted to do a book about Lennon. Baird
wanted to do a book about the ex-Beatle's maligned mother, whose
name also was Julia.
</P>
<P>
The result is a little of both, a mishmash of anecdotes showing a
moody but generally happy Liverpool boy singing with his mother in a
bathroom with good acoustics.
</P>
<P>
Baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his
father decamped and Julia turned her son over to her sister, Mimi,
Lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother.
``I didn't do it for John,'' said Baird. ``I wanted to set the
record straight about our mother, and that ties in with John. I feel
my mother has been badly misrepresented in the press.''
Baird, a 41-year-old teacher in Cheshire, England, was born seven
years after Lennon to Julia and her common-law second husband, John
Dykins. She and her younger sister, Jacqui, grew up with their
parents amid an extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins _ and big
brother John.
</P>
<P>
The book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub
when teen-agers Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison drop by
for bathroom jam sessions with Julia. It tells of an alternately
thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters at
the movies for hours while he goes on a date, who between songs at a
Beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the Dykins girls
out of the front row, away from screaming fans threatening to storm
the stage.
</P>
<P>
But mostly it tells of a mother and son who, while living apart,
had a loving relationship.
</P>
<P>
The book got its start after Baird watched a British television
special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of Lennon's murder.
</P>
<P>
The show presented Julia ``as an unfit mother, no mother at all,''
Baird said.
</P>
<P>
Baird complained and was urged to tell her story. She wrote an
essay and arranged to publish it in Liverpool. Then she met
Giuliano, who was in Liverpool to promote his first book, ``The
Beatles: A Celebration.''
Giuliano, 35, a self-proclaimed huckster, convinced Baird to work
with him on a book, which he pieced together from interviews with
Baird in England. While proofreading the text, Baird sent a copy to
McCartney. He sent his blessing, plus a bonus: a brief foreword for
the book.
</P>
<P>
With a collection of rare early photos, the book is more a family
album than a biography. Giuliano's text reads like oral history, as
if a British schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across
the reader's knees to boast about her brother, the musician.
</P>
<P>
However, the book is a narrow view of Lennon, a child's
recollections of an aspiring brother. After Julia was killed in a
traffic accident in 1958, Baird saw less and less of Lennon, losing
contact with him for years when he and wife Yoko Ono moved to the
United States. The end of the book describes what Baird calls
Lennon's desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots, when she and her
step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80.
</P>
<P>
Baird has been accused of cashing in on her step-brother but
insists she just wants to tell the family's story of Lennon's early
years.
``I could have cashed in when John was alive,'' Baird said.
``When John died the tabloids in England were knocking on the door
saying, `Write your story, name your price.' We quickly showed them
the door.''
Also shown the door was Albert Goldman, whose sordid biography,
``The Lives of John Lennon,'' hit bookstores about the same time as
Baird's book. Baird, who read Goldman's scathing biography of Elvis
Presley, said she turned down an interview with Goldman, who brands
Lennon homosexual, anorexic and possibly a murderer.
``I had heard Goldman was doing the book six years ago, and I
knew what the tone would be,'' Baird said. ``Most people, including
Goldman, write books based on other books that have it all wrong.''
Giuliano was harsher.
``Goldman was in it for the money from day one,'' Giuliano said.
``Goldman knows the formula: the more sleaze, the more dough. So
what's his motive? If he writes the sleaziest book he makes the most
dough.''
Baird herself wasn't blind to the business end of publishing. She
agreed to change the title from ``My Brother John'' to ``John
Lennon, My Brother.''
The cover's look-alike photos of Baird and Lennon in granny specs
also help, but she said she didn't don them to sell books. They're
on the National Health, Britain's medical plan, and she and Lennon
inherited their mother's short-sightedness, Baird said.
</P>
<P>
The book itself is a loving look through rose-colored specs of a
brother whose art touched millions.
``It's not a major biography,'' Giuliano said. ``This book is a
little slice out of a big pie, out of a big life. It offers a lot of
previously unknown details on Lennon's early life. It's a
sympathetic view, sure, but what's not to love?''

Thousands of John Lennon fans, some
too young to remember the Beatles, swayed and sang along with songs
including his anthem ``Imagine'' at a hometown tribute.
``It's a great day, isn't it?'' Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, asked
the crowd. ``I think John would be happy, too.''
At the close of the concert, she and son Sean, 14, wept and
hugged some of the musicians, who included B.B. King, Joe Cocker,
Roberta Flack, the Moody Blues, Hall and Oates, Wet Wet Wet and
Randy Travis.
</P>
<P>
However, the turnout was only 15,000, according to police
estimates. Organizers had hoped for about 45,000. Tickets were $41
for the charity benefit concert, which featured a program of
Beatles and Lennon songs.
</P>
<P>
The concert was televised in Britain and was to be rebroadcast
worldwide in October in a 50th birthday tribute to Lennon a decade
after his death.
</P>
<P>
Cyndi Lauper, in a white minidress, sang ``Hey Bulldog,'' and
Dave Edmunds, backed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra,
did the Beatles classic, ``A Day in the Life.''
Soul singer Al Green was the opening act. His version of ``All
You Need is Love,'' turned into a singalong with the crowd, and
Kylie Minogue did ``Help.''
American actor Christopher Reeve was among the hosts of the
concert.
</P>
<P>
Ex-Beatles George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr did
not attend, but McCartney and Starr made taped contributions.
</P>
<P>
On tape, Starr performed ``I Call Your Name'' and said, ``John
had the biggest heart of any man I have ever met to this day. He
was a giving, loving, caring human being. He was crazy as well some
days _ but the guy would give you his heart.''
Lennon's co-songwriter, Paul McCartney, said on his tape:
``Hello Liverpool, scene of many great memories, John, me and the
rest of the lads.'' The Beatles were raised in Liverpool and got
their start in the Merseyside bars.
</P>
<P>
All the musicians assembled on stage for ``Give Peace a
Chance,'' as the enthusiastic audience sang along, waved and
clapped.
</P>
<P>
The concert closed with a recording of Lennon singing
``Imagine,'' while giant screens showed a video featuring John and
Yoko.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds are to go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity founded
by the Lennons in 1978, two years before Lennon was shot to death
in front of his apartment in New York City.
</P>
<P>
Lennon was slain on Dec. 8, 1980, when he was 40. The confessed
killer, Mark Chapman, is serving a life prison sentence.

Lennon's `Imagine' Broadcast Worldwide on 50th Birthday
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 50th anniversary of John Lennon's birth was
observed with a global celebration today as his peace anthem
``Imagine'' was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130
nations.
</P>
<P>
The song was played shortly after 10 a.m. following a brief
ceremony at the United Nations that featured the ex-Beatle's widow,
Yoko Ono. Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N. secretary
general, also provided a brief introduction. A recorded message
from the slain Beatle was played as well.
``In celebration of John's life, let's use our power of
dreaming,'' Ono said. ``Let's dream of trees growing in abundance,
birds flying in clear air, fish swimming in clear water and our
children living in joy.
``Let's dream of men and women feeling good together and people
embracing each other regardless of their creed and religion,'' she
said. ``Let's dream of all races praising one another in the
knowledge that the differences are what makes the human race.''
The U.N. Trusteeship Council Chamber was about one-third full
with a couple of hundred people for the observance and about 150
people watched on television monitors in the visitors' lobby. A
group of 10 teen-agers in blue jeans and T-shirts sat on the floor,
held hands and meditated.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries
had signed on for the satellite broadcast by last week. U.S. Armed
Forces television and radio beamed the event to 80-plus countries.
</P>
<P>
MTV was to broadcast the program in 25 countries, said network
spokeswoman Andrea Smith.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 fans gathered at the late Beatle's sidewalk star on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles to honor the
singer-songwriter. Some held candles and others carried birthday
balloons.
</P>
<P>
Beatles fans gathered in Liverpool today to pay tribute to
Lennon. Civic dignitaries planned to join them at the city's Cavern
Walks shopping precinct - on the ite of the legendary Cavern Club
where the group was discovered.
</P>
<P>
In New York, fans planned a tearful pilgrimage to the spot
outside the Dakota apartment building where Lennon was gunned down
almost 10 years ago.
``Lennon always symbolized for us somebody who was able to
handle rock and roll with a sense of humor and later, even more
importantly, as someone who cared for the rights of an individual,
human rights in general, and who had the right concept of freedom
and peace,'' said Ondrej Konrad, the editor of Czechoslovakia's
leading popular music publication.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Pollack, head of the California-based Pollack Media Group,
proposed the idea to Ono, who gave it the go-ahead. She believes
recent events around the world - in Germany, Eastern Europe and
particularly the Middle East - show the importance of Lennon's
peace message.
``When this was discussed, we had no knowledge of what would
happen in Iraq and Kuwait, you know. And now it seems very
appropriate that this be sung all over the world,'' Ono said.
``I don't know, the timing is incredible. It's beyond me ...
</P>
<P>
It's beautiful.''
``Imagine'' is Lennon's musical vision of a world free of war
and poverty. Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940 and helped lead the
Beatles to international stardom, along with co-members Paul
McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
</P>
<P>
He fatally gunned down by an obsessed fan outside his Manhattan
apartment building in December 1980.
</P>
<P>
The tribute coincides with the release of a four-compact disc
set of 73 songs, including 61 written by Lennon. Also in honor of
Lennon's 50th birthday, McCartney is releasing his live version of
``Birthday.''

On the spot where Lenin once spoke, the focus
Tuesday was on Lennon.
</P>
<P>
Official newspapers, which once denounced the Beatles as harmful
pests from the decadent West, joined a worldwide celebration and
ran stories of tribute about the late John Lennon, who would have
turned 50 on Tuesday. State radio broadcast his music and
interviews about him.
</P>
<P>
Two concerts devoted to the songwriter, guitarist and singer,
who was shot to death in 1980, were held in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Even the staid state television program ``Vremya'' got into act.
</P>
<P>
An anchorman, more accustomed to reading official government news,
reported on the worldwide Lennon birthday bash and called his song
``Imagine,'' an ``anthem of peace.'' The broadcast ended with an
instrumental version of ``Yesterday'' playing as temperatures from
around the nation rolled across the screen.
</P>
<P>
The celebration was a dramatic turnabout from Soviet
authorities' repression of Beatles fans and supression of their
music in earlier times. Their music was banned and the Soviet press
condemned them. A 1964 article, for instance, commented, ``These
bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.''
About 1,000 Soviets, mostly second generation Beatles fans,
flocked to the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall in
northeastern part of the city to rejoice in Lennon's music. A
plaque outside the hall reminded Beatles fans that Lennon's near
namesake, Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, had
spoken at the spot in 1917 and 1919.
</P>
<P>
Inside, fans listened to recordings of Lennon's music, attended
a concert of about a dozen Soviet rock bands, bought his albums and
posters and reflected on his life.
``He's like a hero, a symbol for every person: a symbol of
honesty, talent, devotion to his ideals, notion of love, equality
between people and goodness,'' said Irina Dykomkina, the
21-year-old secretary of the Sgt. Pepper's Club, a Soviet Beatles
fan club formed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lennon's music, she said, crosses borders easily.
``His music is so sincere, it's so understandable, even to
people who don't know English. They feel the music.''
Andrei Trushkin, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda - the
Communist Party youth newspaper that devoted a full page Tuesday to
Lennon - said he appeals to Soviet youth in part because he was a
rebel, like many of them, and was a ``difficult teen-ager.''
``The cops would have locked him up many times,'' said Trushkin,
who helped organize the concert.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's concert opened in the spirit of a birthday party.
</P>
<P>
Balloons floated down from the balconies as a tape of Lennon's
song, ``Starting Over,'' played. The stage was adorned with a
painting of Lennon and life-size cardboard cutouts of the Fab Four
in front of the British flag.
``Oorah! Oorah!'' shouted the audience, which included a few
soldiers in uniform. Onstage, the groups Sprint, Quiet Hour and
Optimal Variant played in Beatles style but were joined by a group
that didn't quite fit in the genre, an American-style country
ensemble that wore plaid vests and performed ``Night Train to
Memphis.''

John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was
delivered Tuesday as his song ``Imagine'' was played simultaneously
for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have
been his 50th birthday.
``A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream
together is reality. Happy birthday, John. The world is better
today for sharing a time with you,'' Yoko Ono said at a United
Nations ceremony before the playing of ``Imagine.''
The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a
taped message that served as an introduction to the music.
``We all want peace, whatever sort of job we have. ... Think of
your children. Do you want them to be killed or don't you? And
that's the choice we have in front of us. War or peace,'' said
Lennon, whose son Sean turned 15 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
None of the other Beatles were at the United Nations, but a
tribute came from Lennon's old songwriting partner, Paul McCartney,
who released a live version of the Beatles' tune ``Birthday.'' The
song, originally on the ``White Album,'' was the first
Lennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in
1969.
``The release date and John's birthday is just a happy
coincidence, but it's also a nod and a wink to my old mate,'' said
McCartney, 47.
</P>
<P>
Other observances were held from Liverpool to Moscow to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
In Lennon's hometown in England, fans gathered at the former
site of the Cavern Club, where the Beatles were discovered.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending was Lennon's 71-year-old uncle, Charlie
Lennon.
</P>
<P>
When asked how his nephew would have reacted to the ceremonies,
he said: ``If he had been alive I doubt he would have come and even
if he had, he would sat with me in the pub and had a good laugh.''
On the West Coast, about 50 people - part of an estimated 1
billion people worldwide who had access to the event - stood near
Lennon's star on the Walk of Fame and listened to the ``Imagine''
broadcast:
``Imagine all the people, living life in peace
``You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
``I hope some day you'll join us
``And the world will live as one.''
``His spirit still lives in all of us whose lives have been
touched with him,'' Ono said of her late husband.
``I would like us to remember and celebrate his birthday as a
day of love, because he was a man of love, and because love is much
needed at this time in our lives.''
Ono was greeted by Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N.
secretary-general. During her brief remarks, Ono also quoted a line
from another of Lennon's songs, ``Happy Xmas (War is Over)'':
``Remember, war is over if you want it.''
More than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries
broadcast the 10-minute event. U.S. Armed Forces television and
radio beamed it to 80-plus other countries. MTV televised the
``Imagine'' video in 25 countries, said Andrea Smith, a spokeswoman
for the network.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, about 1,000 Soviets gathered at the Moscow Electrical
Lamp Factory's cultural hall to listen to Lennon's music, snap up
his albums and posters and reflect on his life.
</P>
<P>
Even the staid state television program ``Vremya'' got into the
act. An anchorman, reporting on the worldwide birthday bash,
described ``Imagine'' as an ``anthem of peace.'' The broadcast
ended with an instrumental version of ``Yesterday.''
Not so long ago, the Beatles' music was banned in the Soviet
Union. In 1964, one commentator warned that ``these bugs can
swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.''
Lennon was shot to death by a deranged fan outside his Manhattan
apartment building on Dec. 8, 1980.

At this point, Lennon says he became a househusband to their
child while Yoko ran the family business. The arrangement continued
until Lennon told the woman he called ``Mother'' it was time to
make music again. ``Double Fantasy'' followed just before John's
death, although it was not to be Lennon's swan song.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Springsteen has released three albums since 1980; Michael
Jackson two. In contrast, Lennon - or, more accurately, Ono - has
released five albums: ``Milk and Honey,'' ``Menlove Ave.,'' the
movie soundtrack ``Imagine,'' the ``John Lennon - Live in New
York'' collection and a boxed CD collection for Christmas '90.
</P>
<P>
In addition, ``The Lost Lennon Tapes,'' featuring hours of
unreleased Lennon music, became a popular syndicated radio program.
</P>
<P>
Ono has overseen all these projects.
``People ask me, `What would he have done in the '80s?' I say,
`Let's talk about what he HAS done in the '80s,' because he has
definitely,'' she said. ``In spirit, I think he's alive, and we're
getting the benefit.''
Others charge Ono with turning her memories into millions
without concern for Lennon's image. A Fame magazine profile derided
her as ``The Merry Widow''; the now-defunct weekly 7 Days described
her as the decade's ``premier celebrity civil defendant.''
Greed, insensitivity, egomania. None of Ono's alleged faults are
apparent in an interview.
</P>
<P>
In October, a barefoot Ono greeted a visitor to the Dakota in a
high-ceilinged first-floor room with white carpet and black onyx
walls. Curled up on a chair, she serenely sipped herbal tea from a
mug decorated with a Lennon drawing of John and Yoko with the
inscription, ``Grow Old With Me.''
The mug is one of an assortment of Lennon collectibles available
(by appointment only) from Bag One Arts Inc., the entity that
controls reproductions of Lennon's art work.
</P>
<P>
Some of that black on white artwork - which includes doodles
jotted down on napkins, the margins of letters or stray scraps of
paper - has been colorized or redone in neon at Ono's order.
``People would ask if we had anything in color,'' says Lynne
Clifford, who runs Bag One for Yoko. ``And Yoko said, `I feel
confident enough to add the color myself. So she took the original
sketches and we made plates and she added colors.''
Lithographs that sold for $400 four years ago have increased as
much as 10 times in value, she says, and new ones cost between $600
and $700.
</P>
<P>
Although Bag One's gallery a few blocks from the Dakota deals
primarily in lithographs, it also sells the collectibles, including
$3 laminated bags that bear Lennon's drawings.
``Yoko wanted everybody to be able to walk away with
something,'' explained Clifford.
</P>
<P>
Where does all the money go?
``Yoko is very funny about (saying) where the money goes. ...
</P>
<P>
But some goes to the Spirit Foundation,'' she said. The foundation,
established by Lennon and Ono before John's death, has contributed
to causes ranging from a home for drug addicted children to
bulletproof vests for police officers.
</P>
<P>
Is there anything that will never bear Lennon's sketch-work?
</P>
<P>
Socks, Clifford said. ``Yoko said she couldn't imagine people
walking around on John's drawings.''
Back at the Dakota, Ono receives a familiar question: Is this
all commercialism? Has the iconoclastic ex-Beatle been sold out?
</P>
<P>
She laughs.
``No. I didn't sell out John. And I'm sure John would be happy
I'm still keeping him out there. ... There's a commercial aspect,
yes, but I mean, why not? I was a partner, and I still feel that
I'm a partner.''

Just a Working Musician: John Lennon's Final Sessions
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music
in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life:
He was to play on John Lennon's new album.
</P>
<P>
Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy taking
care of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas. But
in 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to
the studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono.
</P>
<P>
It was more than a superstar session. Afterall, Lennon gave no
press conferences, and didn't attend clubs or concerts. Rare photos
occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one (Lennon
jokingly referred to himself as ``Greta Hughes'' and ``Howard
Garbo'').
</P>
<P>
Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as an
engineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Hugh
McCracken and other New York-based sessions players. Recording was
to take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero. He didn't know
him and was nervous about working with him. The drummer guessed he
was something like the intense, irreverent young man of the movies
``Help!'' and ``A Hard Day's Night.'' Lennon was those things - and
more.
``His personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever
heard about John Lennon,'' said Newmark, who still lives in New
York and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.
``His straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as the
stories and images we had created. I didn't see anything that
seemed startlingly new to the myth. It just appeared to be what we
had imagined: down to earth, direct, so direct it could not offend
people.''
Newmark spent just one month in the studio, playing on the songs
that eventually ended up on ``Double Fantasy'' and ``Milk and
Honey,'' Lennon's final albums. It was the ``best experience of my
life,'' he insisted. ``The highlight of my career.''
The nerves quickly settled. Once recording began, Lennon was
just a ``working musician'' with the same goal as everyone else:
finishing the album. The music was mostly mainstream pop; no
18-minute jams or political anthems. ``I hate all that fancy
stuff,'' Lennon told his drummer. ``Keep it simple, like Ringo.''
He was a happy man at this point and his singing was higher,
sweeter than on earlier albums. Lennon was hoping to get back in
touch with his audience, and the songs were melodic, the production
lush.
``Dear Yoko'' and ``Grow Old With Me'' were tributes to his
wife. ``Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)'' was for Sean. Lennon defended
his self-imposed retirement on ``Watching the Wheels'' and summed
up his feelings about turning 40 on ``Borrowed Time,'' capping the
line ``Good to be older'' with a self-assured ``you bet.''
Between takes, Lennon jammed on Buddy Holly songs and played
host. Sushi was the food of choice. The strongest drug was
Brazilian coffee, freshly ground. ``Guys, I'm taking off,'' Lennon
would say as he poured himself another cup.
</P>
<P>
And there were plenty of stories about the Beatles - the
``B's,'' as John called them. Reunions were out of the question, a
return to adolescence in his opinion, but talking about the old
days seemed the nicest kind of high.
``By this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did
and be proud of it,'' Newmark said. ``When he talked about the
`B's,' it was as if it was his band. He was the spiritual leader. I
felt that a lot through the sessions.''
By the fall, Newmark had finished working on the album, and his
contact with Lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the
studio. But he had planned on working with him again. ``Milk and
Honey'' was to come out the following year and Lennon wanted to
tour, using many of the same musicians.
``Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans,''
Lennon once sang.
</P>
<P>
It took the drummer a long time to recover from Lennon's murder
the night of Dec. 8, 1980; he didn't even feel like working for the
next few years - everything else suddenly seemed ``second rate.''
Newmark never listens to the record, but still hears ``Woman''
on the radio. When he thinks about it now, it's not so much a
particular song that hurts him, it's the day-to-day stuff: the
jokes and wisecracks, the coffee and the stories. No one had a
reason to remember all that at the time; those weren't supposed to
be farewell sessions.
``When I looked in his eyes, I felt a tremendous depth of
character and a tremendous understanding of the human condition, a
tremendous amount of compassion,,'' Newmark said. ``He was totally
friendly and open to everybody, including the janitor. He had time
for everybody. That working class hero thing, he was trying to be
real about that.''

Crowds in Liverpool to Mark 10th Anniversary of John Lennon's
Death
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of fans of rock legend and
former Beatle John Lennon gathered in the snow on a windy Saturday
for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool's mayor, Dorothy Gavin, led Lennon devotees who laid
wreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of The Beatles in the city's
Cavern Walks shopping center.
</P>
<P>
The center was built on the original site of the Cavern Club,
made famous when The Beatles played there in the 1960s, and has
become a place of pilgrimage.
``Give peace a chance,'' the title of one of singer-songwriter
Lennon's greatest hits, was the theme for the day.
</P>
<P>
Many friends and followers of Lennon were present, including
Father Tom McKenzie, immortalized as Father MacKenzie in The
Beatles' l966 hit song ``Eleanor Rigby.''
On Friday, a small group of invited guests had gathered at
Liverpool's Beatles Museum to watch Mrs. Gavin unveil a plaque
marking the 10th anniversary of Lennon's death.
``John was always a son of Liverpool and over the last 10 years
Liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the Beatles
came from Liverpool,'' said Lennon biographer Ray Coleman after the
unveiling.
``It is right that a world figure like Lennon should be
recognized at last,'' said Coleman, author of ``John Lennon.''
Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartment
in New York's Dakota apartment building after a recording session
on Dec. 8, 1980, when Lennon was shot to death by Mark David
Chapman, a deranged fan to whom Lennon had given his autograph only
hours before. Lennon was 40.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Lennon family said Ms. Ono and the couple's
son, Sean, were in Europe and would spend the anniversary
privately.
</P>
<P>
Journalist Andy Peebles, the last person to interview Lennon
before he was shot, said in an interview with Sky satellitetelevision news:
``Ten years on, it's a ghastly feeling to think
that you had spent ... seven hours ... with somebody you have been
a fan of for years, and I think I left ... thinking `This is great,
he's in really good shape.'''
Peebles said late in 1980 that Lennon had just recovered from a
period when he had ``gone off the rails'' and his relationship with
Ms. Ono had suffered. ``But (when I saw him) they'd had the baby,
Sean had been born, and everything was great.''

</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NIXON, disco, LSD - it's no surprise, really, that those '70s rejects have
staged comebacks.;   But Yoko Ono? The flaky avant-garde artist whose idea of
music was to scream inside a plastic bag while John Lennon played guitar? The
Evil One who single-handedly killed the Beatles and destroyed her husband's
talent and ambition?  
</P>
<P>
Who could possibly regard her as anything other than a crackpot and a
public menace?;   Well, let's see: there's party rockers the B52s and cult
singer Lene Lovich - successful, critically acclaimed musicians who credit
Ono's music as an influence. There's the Whitney Museum of Art, which
exhibited Ono's artwork last year - one of the 10 museum shows she has had
around the world.;   There's also the American Film Institute, which Ono says
is staging an international tour of her experimental films. And Ono's record
label - "they want to put out all my songs in a kind of CD box or something,"
Ono says.;   Surprised? So's Ono. She's used to rougher treatment. Acceptance
is a difficult concept for her.;   "I'm used to sort of knocking the door
rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it," Ono
says during a telephone interview.;   She's speaking from the New York office
of Bag One Arts, the company Ono founded to promote Lennon's art and image.;  
Marketing an icon; Since his death in 1980, Ono has steadily kept Lennon
products coming out: the albums "Milk and Honey" and "Menlove Avenue" and the
4-CD boxed set "The John Lennon Collection"; the book "Skywriting by Word of
Mouth," a collection of Lennon's unpublished writings; Lennon's art, which Ono
says was his main interest in his final years; and Lennon-inspired
merchandise, such as a line of John Lennon eyeglasses.;   "I told the fans
that I'm going to do 10 years of it. Every year, hopefully, give a new product
and share it with the fans," Ono says. "Some years, we had two or three
products of John that came out.";   The 10-year promise ended with last year's
year-long celebration of Lennon's 50th birthday. In 1991, Ono says, she has
tried to "relax a little and do my own stuff.";   Ono, 57, has been going into
a recording studio every day to work on the proposed boxed-set of her music.
</P>
<P>
She continues to produce art and recently had a museum exhibit in Iceland.;  
Ono began her art career as an abstract impressionist, then went avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
She began doing performance art in the early '60s, long before the form was
legitimized by art critics and government grants.;   A life in two worlds; Ono
declines to put a label on her current works. She says that's for the critics
to decide. "I just like to create," she says.;   Ono still lives in the Dakota
apartment house in New York, the site of Lennon's murder by a crazed fan.;  
On Dec. 8, 1980, the couple was returning home from the recording studio where
they had been remixing "Walking on Thin Ice," one of the songs that would
appear on Ono's most successful album, "Season of Glass." As they approached
the entrance to the building, someone called out "Mr. Lennon?" Lennon turned,
and Mark David Chapman shot him five times with a .38 revolver.;   After
Lennon's death, there was speculation that Ono would leave the United States
forever. She did begin living part-time in Geneva.;   "My theory was that I
would live more and more in Geneva," Ono says. "But it seems like
circumstances are making me come back more and more to New York. This is my
hometown, that's how I feel about it. It's a place where I can work very
well.";   Ono was born in Tokyo - her name means "Ocean Child" - and came
with her family to the United States in 1936. Ono lived with her family in San
Francisco and New York until the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor forced them
to return home.;   In 1951, the Onos returned to New York. Yoko married a
Japanese composer when she was 23. The marriage lasted seven years. Ono
married a second time in 1963, to avant-garde artist Tony Cox. The couple had
one child, a daughter named Kyoko. In 1966, Ono and Lennon met. He too was
married and had a child, Julian. Ono and Lennon were married in 1970.;   There
has been much speculation on Ono and Lennon's relationship. Some say she
controlled him. "John was an extremely strong person," Ono says. "There was no
way to dominate him, even if I wanted to.";   Others say Lennon used his
relationship with Ono as an escape from things in his life that he felt were
controlling him - such as the Beatles.;   In May 1968, when the Beatles came
together at the studio to work on "The Beatles," the two-record set commonly
called "The White Album," Ono was at Lennon's side. The two were inseparable.
</P>
<P>
According to at least one Beatles biographer, Ono even accompanied Lennon on
trips to the bathroom.;   The relationship between the Beatles - especially
Lennon and Paul McCartney - was already strained. Having Ono in the studio,
offering suggestions and backing Lennon up in arguments, didn't help.;  
Still, the group already seemed headed toward a break-up, which finally came
when McCartney sued the other Beatles to resolve an argument over the group's
management. So, no, Ono didn't break up the Beatles. But it's also true that
three of them didn't like her much.;   Life after John; "I think the very fact
that John and I got together hurt them a lot," she says. "It's 50/50. We hurt
them and they hurt us. I can't really say it's a one-sided situation.";   Ono
says she feels no bitterness toward the surviving Beatles.;   "Songwriters in
this world are pretty harmless people," she says. "They're not doing anything
like creating a nuclear bomb or trying to decide whether people should be
killed. They're pretty peaceful people and their songs will hopefully inspire
people. I have a lot of respect for them.";   But how do the Beatles feel
toward Ono these days?;   "It varies," she says. "Sometimes they are friendly,
sometimes they are not . . . like all relationships with friends. I think
that's natural.";   Many of the books that have been written about Lennon and
the Beatles, especially Albert Goldman's loathing portrait of Lennon, have
been painful to Ono. But she says she isn't sure about writing her own
version.;   "I was hurt very much, and my son, too, by some of the things that
were written," she says. "They were lies and that's what hurt us.;   "Then
again, when I think of writing my true story . . . I could say 'this is the
truth' and write about things somebody did or whatever, but then I think about
their children. If you look at it from the big picture, maybe there was not
such an incredible crime done to me."

Say what you want about Albert Goldman, the author of the new biography, "The Lives of John Lennon" (Morrow, $22.95), but you've got to hand it to him: This guy is one ambitious sleazemonger. 
</P>
<P>
Most best-selling pop biographers play it safe: They choose a celeb of respectable, not to say pristine, reputation, and then they proceed to blacken it, preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess, chemical dependency, personal unkindness, raw business dealings, even, in some cases, dyslexia. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who can't spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public, which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself to buy the biography by the millions. 
</P>
<P>
A can't-miss formula, surely. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Goldman's previous victim in the genre was Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
Now Mr. Presley was, if you'll forgive the expression, a fat target for a writer of Mr. Goldman's methods. 
</P>
<P>
His title notwithstanding, the "King of Rock 'n' Roll" was in truth more a creature of the old show biz, a star whose wholesome image, carefully created by P.R. wizards, was ripe for debunking. 
</P>
<P>
But in choosing Mr. Lennon as his next target, Mr. Goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable. 
</P>
<P>
For apart from his puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic in the thousands of interviews he gave was his own squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy to employees, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on. 
</P>
<P>
By his own accounting, then, Mr. Lennon was not about to dethrone Ward Cleaver as the all-American dad. 
</P>
<P>
His public loved him in spite of it all - or perhaps because of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lennon grew to celebrity during a time when such transgressions as intemperance and adultery (quaint terms!) were losing their social sting. 
</P>
<P>
His candor - if that's what it was, and not simple logorrhea - redeemed everything. 
</P>
<P>
And so it is on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot to debunk, attacks his subject. 
</P>
<P>
The leitmotif of Mr. Lennon's confessions was that his worst days were behind him, and that with Yoko Ono he had at last learned to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity. 
</P>
<P>
Now Mr. Goldman is here to announce: He didn't tell you the half of it. 
</P>
<P>
Hence this 718-page stew of unrelieved sordidness, percolating with the "scoops" that have by now been widely publicized in People magazine, "West 57th" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon had a thing for young boys; that his marriage to Ms. Ono was pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage; that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit. 
</P>
<P>
The squalid revelations dribble out like a chemical leak, sliming up every page. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, then, the sleazemonger's art has triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon is even worse than John Lennon's John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
A great deal of this muck manages to splash onto Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portrays as a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploiting Mr. Lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Goldman, alas, allows to pass unremarked the obvious irony that this is a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself as well. 
</P>
<P>
The keepers of the Lennon flame have of course been quick to point this out. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Ono and her son have taken the path preferred by offended celebrities, they have hit the talk shows to display their wounds. 
</P>
<P>
And Rolling Stone magazine, long the house organ for the Lennon publicity machine, recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book, which was undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic. 
</P>
<P>
Criticizing "The Lives of John Lennon" for insufficient respect to the fallen Beatle's legacy is rather off the point - like condemning Charles Manson for his bad table manners. 
</P>
<P>
The book may indeed be inaccurate, as critics have charged. 
</P>
<P>
But one can only hope that quibbles about its veracity do not obscure the countless other reasons to hate Mr. Goldman's book. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for starters, the sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive of the grad-school smoking lounge - Mr. Goldman is the sort of writer who refers to pop songs as "pieces," as though they were concerti. 
</P>
<P>
There is his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach - toward drugs, sex, music - that gives him license to second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move. 
</P>
<P>
And there is the awkward organization, in which minor events assume large proportions for the simple reason that they reflect badly on Mr. Lennon, while major events are skipped over lightly because - there goes the advance! - they might reveal Mr. Lennon in a flattering light. 
</P>
<P>
All of which indicates why "The Lives of John Lennon" is such a wretched book: not because it makes a good man look bad, but because it shows no other purpose than to make a man - whether a good man or a bad one, we laymen will probably never know - look bad. 
</P>
<P>
John Lennon, while he was alive, did enough of that himself to satisfy all but the lowest appetites.
