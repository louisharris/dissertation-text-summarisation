Miners Strike On Anniversary Of Solidarity
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 4,000 workers at a coal mine in
the southern city of Jastrzebie went on strike today to demand
legalization of Solidarity and higher wages, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The strike in Jastrzebie, about 275 miles southwest of Warsaw,
comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawed
trade federation.
</P>
<P>
Solidarity spokeswoman Katarzyna Ketrzynska said workers on the
overnight shift at the Manifest Lipcowy mine stayed outside the
mine shaft all night and were joined by workers arriving for the
morning shift.
</P>
<P>
She said security officers blocked miners on the afternoon
shift, which starts at 2 p.m., from entering the grounds to join
the striking miners. The strike began at noon today, according to
Katrzynska.
</P>
<P>
She said the miners are demanding the legalization of Solidarity
and reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. The
workers are also calling for higher wages and better working
conditions, and are requesting two lawyers and two economists to
assist them in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Manifest Lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region of
Silesia to experience unrest.
</P>
<P>
Workers at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw staged
a protest rally Monday to demand improved safety conditions and the
return of Solidarity activists to work. Three members of Solidarity
were barred Saturday from working.
</P>
<P>
Solidarity was crushed in 1981, when the government imposed
martial law, and was banned nearly a year later by parliament.
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around the northern port
of Gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form Solidarity, the
first and only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.

Port Workers, Coal Miners Join Strike To Legalize Solidarity
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>JASTRZEBIE, Poland (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Port workers in Szczecin and
southwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes with
miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity, opposition
activists said.
</P>
<P>
In support of an estimated 3,000 colleagues striking for a
second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at the
nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and
launched their own occupation strike.
</P>
<P>
Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin, about 250 miles
northwest of Warsaw, and set up a 15-member strike committee, said
Jan Kostecki, a leader of the independent union federation.
</P>
<P>
A local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal,
Solidarity officials said.
</P>
<P>
Andrzej Andrzejczak, head of the Morcinek mine strike committee,
said: ``We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mine
workers.''
The mine is about 12 miles south of July Manifesto, where
strikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independent
labor federation, pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired for
trade union activites.
</P>
<P>
Police ringing July Manifesto, one of Poland's largest coal
mines, today turned away area residents who tried to bring food to
the strikers.
</P>
<P>
Andrzejczak said the Morcinek miners broke off talks with
management when they were refused access to loudspeakers and
contact with the strikers at July Manifesto. He said miners erected
a large Polish flag atop the administration building and were
blocking the complex's main entrance.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known how many workers were involved.
</P>
<P>
The second strike came as Solidarity strike committee members
met with management and representatives of the Industry Ministry at
the July Manifesto colliery.
</P>
<P>
Adam Kowalczyk, a regional Solidarity leader, said more workers
were joining colleagues inside by leaping over police barricades.
</P>
<P>
The strike committee issued a communique today saying the
workers would not end their stoppage until their demands are met
and charged: ``The mine management is trying to end the strike by
hunger.''
Police surrounded the mine after workers put down their tools on
Tuesday. Witnesses said about 600 officers were outside and about
3,000 strikers inside.
</P>
<P>
The strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of the
Solidarity, which Communist authorities crushed in a 1981 military
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Miners leaving July Manifesto this morning said wage demands
were based on hardships caused by Poland's worsening economy,
including 60 percent inflation.
``The economy is in ruins,'' one told The Associated Press.
``Miners cannot live on their salaries because of recent price
hikes.''
Miners earn nearly twice the average national salary and receive
extra benefits because of the vital role they play in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Poland is the world's fourth largest exporter of coal, and coal is
the nation's leading export.
</P>
<P>
July Manifesto, a hotbed of labor activism during the strike
wave that spawned Solidarity, is one of five coal mines in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said there were no reports of
violence and police made no attempt to move into the mine, which is
280 miles southwest of Warsaw and employs about 9,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
The state-run PAP news agency, in a dispatch late Tuesday, said
the strike was illegal. PAP said the miners were warned that ``they
may be held responsible for their illegal actions.''
The July Manifesto mine is in Silesia, Poland's industrial
heartland.
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, a wave of mine strikes in Silesia ended with
the signing at July Manifesto of the last of three agreements that
established Solidarity across the nation. The pact also won
work-free weekends.
</P>
<P>
Solidarity leaders said the strike began Tuesday when overnight
shift workers refused to take up their tools. They were joined by
workers arriving for the morning shift, Kuron said.
</P>
<P>
Kuron said mine management then locked out members of the
afternoon shift to prevent them from joining the strike.
</P>
<P>
Solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby Borynia mine
staged a brief sympathy rally but went back to work Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, security officials briefly detained 10 Solidarity
activists at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw in
lower Silesia.
</P>
<P>
That mine has also been the scene of unrest in recent months,
where workers have demanded improved safety conditions.
</P>
<P>
Five strikes in Poland from April 25 to May 10, and brief
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more work places, constituted the
worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law
crackdown. One of the stoppages, at a steel mill near Krakow, was
broken up by security forces.
</P>
<P>
The workers in those strikes also demanded the legalization of
Solidarity, along with wage increases.

Sympathy Strikes Spread to Other States

<P>
More than 10,000 coal miners in four
states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in
Virginia and West Virginia who have waged a bitter strike since
April against the Pittston Coal Group.
</P>
<P>
Miners in Pennsylvania and Kentucky today became the third and
fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies. The sympathy
strikes began Monday in West Virginia and spread to Indiana late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One United Mine Workers representative said today that the
Indiana walkout was prompted by Thursday night's telecast of CBS'
``48 Hours,'' which focused on the Pittston strike, in which 1,600
miners have been off the job since April.
</P>
<P>
Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association
to negotiate with the union independently, and the two sides have
failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
UMW officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are
responsible for the wildcat strike. Some said they are asking union
members to return to work, but Tommy Buchanan, international
executive board member in UMW District 20 in Birmingham, Ala., said
today the final decision on whether 5,000 Alabama miners will join
the strike will be with union President Richard Trumka.
``It might be two days. It might be a week. It will start
whenever it comes down from the union president,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
Union spokesman Joe Corcoran was not in his office and has not
returned phone calls this week.
</P>
<P>
The head of the coal industry bargaining unit said he had no
plans to confer with the Pittston on the wildcat strikes.
``I would no more try to tell someone else how to run their
company than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how to
run my company,'' said Robert H. Quenon, president of Peabody
Holding Co., the nation's largest coal producer, and chairman of the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
</P>
<P>
Quenon flew to Charleston from St. Louis on Thursday to meet with
reporters and express Peabody's and the association's concerns about
the walkout.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2,300 United Mine Workers members stayed away from
their jobs today in Pennsylvania. Most worked for Rochester 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations in central Pennsylvania, where 1,600
miners failed to report for work at midnight Thursday, said company
spokesman Hank Waneck said.
</P>
<P>
About 290 miners at Peabody's Camp No. 1 mine in Morganfield,
Ky., didn't report for work today, said company spokesman Tom Clarke.
</P>
<P>
At least 270 miners were off the job at two mines in Indiana
today, spokesmen said. Mark Arnold, a spokesman for UMW District 11
in Terre Haute, attributed the action to the CBS show.
``When the miners saw that last night, that kind of set them off
to where they decided to walk out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of West Virginia's 24,000 miners were reported
off the job today. Some 600 miners in Wise County, Va., who walked
out earlier in the week returned to work this morning.
</P>
<P>
The coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other than
Pittston violate a no-strike clause in the 1988 national contract
the union signed with the association. Pittston did not take part in
that agreement.
</P>
<P>
Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but in
the past they have said they have not authorized the walkout.
``I think the union leadership ought to exercise its leadership
role and do what they can to lead the miners back to work,'' Quenon
said. ``That's why we have a union. That's why we have an agreement
with the union _ to set out the terms and conditions under which we
will have labor to run our coal mines.
``And we expect that to be honored.''

<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that
thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urging
railway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrest
threatens his economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Strikes have shut down more than 200 mines and factories in the
country's two top coal-producing regions, official reports said. In
a report to the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev said they have resulted in
a 1 million-ton drop in coal production.
</P>
<P>
Following Gorbachev to the podium, legislator Anatoly Saunin said
each lost work day cost millions of rubles that might otherwise help
improve living conditions. ``You mustn't hold a knife to the
throat'' of the government, he told strikers.
</P>
<P>
Saunin, from the Donetsk region of the Ukraine, the country's top
coal region, said the number of striking mines there increased from
20 on Tuesday to 58 today.
``Now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the
strike as of Aug. 1,'' Gorbachev said during the parliamentary
session, which was broadcast on television and radio.
``Such a development of events poses a threat to the
implementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika,'' he
said, referring to his efforts to restructure the economy.
</P>
<P>
Miners began walking out July 11 in Siberia's Kuznetsk Basin coal
region. Workers in other industries in the region soon followed. On
Saturday, miners in the Donetsk coal basin began walking off the job.
</P>
<P>
The miners are demanding more local control over their industry
as well as higher wages and better living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegram
to miners in the Ukraine assuring them that any concessions granted
to Siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well.
</P>
<P>
He blamed some of the miners' discontent on ``anti-socialist''
elements but said he understood their basic demands.
</P>
<P>
Government negotiations with strike committees have resolved most
of the miners' demands, including those on pensions and overtime,
but some longer-term questions will take up to a month to settle,
and the miners are refusing any delay, he said.
</P>
<P>
Central authorities have so far balked at granting miners more
control over their industry.
</P>
<P>
If the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy, ``We may
have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been
doing,'' Gorbachev said, without specifying what steps he would take.
</P>
<P>
He said the lost coal production could not be recovered by
increasing the mines' output because they already work at full
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports have put the total number of strikers in the
Donetsk and Kuznetsk regions at more than 112,000, but the number
appeared to be rising.
</P>
<P>
Because of disrupted coal deliveries, the strike threatened ``a
catastrophe'' at metallurgical and electrical power plants, Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
The Politburo sent to Kuznetsk Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member of
the ruling Communist Party body who worked several years in the
tractor-building industry and has spoken about labor discipline.
</P>
<P>
He held marathon meetings with strikers Monday night and Tuesday
and addressed 30,000 people in the main square of Prokopyevsk, 2,100
miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Miners in the Donetsk Basin are demanding a 40 percent wage
increase for night work, improved living conditions, a fixed day off
and retirement after 20 years of underground work.
</P>
<P>
They also demand that the Coal Mining Ministry trim its
managerial staff.
</P>
<P>
Tass carried a report Tuesday denying that the Soviet Union's
third major coal region, Karaganda in Kazakhstan, also was on strike.
</P>
<P>
A proposed law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts is
being rushed through the Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the strike committee in Prokopyevsk, Valery
Legachev, said Tuesday that Slyunkov ``promised to increase the
area's regular food supplies by 20 to 30 percent, as well as soap
and washing powder.''
Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported Tuesday that
Slyunkov promised higher pay for night work, longer vacations and a
doubling of the wholesale price of coal to pay for the benefits.
</P>
<P>
The strikes are believed to be the nation's worst since the
1920s, when the country was gripped in revolution, civil war and a
power struggle. Records from that period are sketchy, but fighting
was widespread and industrial production was severely disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Until Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the official media did not
report job actions in the Soviet Union. Underground reports
described strikes that were of much shorter and not as widespread as
those in Kuznetsk and Donetsk.

<P>
Strikes by tens of thousands of
miners in this Siberian coal region spread to four more of the
Soviet Union's coal fields, Tass reported today.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency said coal miners in Vorkuta in the far
north, the Don River city of Rostov in southwestern Russia and the
Ukrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk walked out Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Miners in the Karaganda region in Soviet Central Asia today
refused to work, Tass said. By evening, 14 mines in the region, home
of the country's third-largest coal fields, were reported at a
standstill.
</P>
<P>
Tass said their demands were similar to those of striking miners
in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basins, who are seeking greater
local control over their industries and better wages and living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, are
the country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the
country's worst labor unrest since the 1920s. Novokuznetsk is a
major city in the Kuznetsk region, where the strikes began 10 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
The government has acknowledged that living and working
conditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has made
general pledges of improvements.
</P>
<P>
Tass reported Wednesday that some miners in Siberia had returned
to work after the government made pay concessions.
</P>
<P>
The government also has promised to send extra meat, butter,
sugar, tea, leather shoes, furniture and cars to relieve shortages
in the region, the Communist Youth League newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda said today.
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper and Tass reported more disturbances in the
Ukraine. Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a communist official in the
Donetsk city of Makeyevka as saying, ``The scale of the strike is
growing. Practically all the coal enterprises of the city have
stopped work.''
Miners in Vorkuta, Rostov and Dnepropetrovsk all walked off the
job on Wednesday, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
In Vorkuta, strikers sent a letter to the Kremlin asking for an
``urgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problems of the
coal sector, and also specific problems of workers of the far
north,'' Tass said.
</P>
<P>
In Rostov, miners' economic demands included extra pay for
evening and night shifts, longer vacations and an increase in the
price of coal to world market prices, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In Dnepropetrovsk, which is 150 miles from Donetsk, workers'
demands mirrored those of Donetsk and Kuznetsk miners.
</P>
<P>
In Karaganda, strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete
news accounts of miners' demands in the Kuznetsk strikes, according
to Tass.
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday the strikes could
imperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workers
being urged to strike.
</P>
<P>
He said that if labor trouble spreads, ``We may have to take such
extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing'' to
overhaul the economy through greater attention to free-market
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Strikes are rare in the Soviet Union and were ended by force
before Gorbachev gained power in March 1985.
</P>
<P>
Tass today said that the Kuznetsk strike had reached ``a turning
point,'' with nine out of 11 mining centers back at work.
</P>
<P>
It was not known how many more employees were back on the job
today. On Wednesday, Tass said that 24,000 strikers in Kuznetsk were
back at work and 150,000 remained on strike.
</P>
<P>
State television said Wednesday that the strike in the Donetsk
basin had spread to 70 of its 120 mines, more than triple the
previous number, and that mine construction workers had joined.
</P>
<P>
In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, television said
steel and coke-chemical plants were ``on the verge of a stoppage''
for lack of coal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports in the official press had said operations at
steel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal and
coke.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told the national legislature Wednesday that the
strikes had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed to most miner demands, including those
on pensions and overtime, Gorbachev said. But he said that settling
some longer-term issues would take up to a month.
</P>
<P>
Tass outlined a concessions package that includes bonus pay to
night shifts and for men using jackhammers.
</P>
<P>
Strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortages of
consumer goods and food, and the government has made general pledges
of improvements in those areas.

<P>
Coal miners in Siberia ended their
strike today after exacting promises of better food, housing and
working conditions, but the wave of unrest they launched continued
in other key coal regions.
</P>
<P>
Some of the 150,000 miners who went on strike last week in
Siberia's Kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work Thursday, and
the rest went back today, strike leaders and the official Tass news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Despite announcements that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
sweeping concessions _ including granting miners greater control
over their industry _ apply nationwide, hundreds of thousands of
miners stayed off the job elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
In the largest coal region, the Donetsk Coal Basin of the
Ukraine, more than 300,000 miners were on strike, the deputy
minister of the coal industry, Alexander P. Fisun, told Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
In the Karaganda region of the southern republic of Kazakhstan,
the Soviet Union's third-biggest coal-producing area, all 26 mines
were at a standstill, and miners made more than 70 demands,
Izvestia said.
</P>
<P>
Strikes were also reported in the Pechora Coal Basin in the
Russian republic, and Chervonograd in the western Ukraine, official
media said.
</P>
<P>
The labor unrest is the Soviet Union's worst in six decades.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has expressed sympathy for the strikers and placed
much of the blame for the miners' deteriorating working and living
conditions on leaders of the officially sanctioned trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Still, he and other Communist leaders have warned that if the
strikes don't end quickly, coal shortages will shut down much of
the country's industry.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Kuznetsk strike committee and members of a
high-level government commission signed an agreement meeting many
demands.
</P>
<P>
The workers were promised higher wages, increased deliveries of
meat, sugar, soap, clothes, furniture and other consumer goods,
more housing construction and _ most important _ a greater voice in
running their industry.
``It's a victory over the system that we've had in the Soviet
Union for the last 70 years, a system in which we work hard but get
little in return,'' said Pyotr A. Menayev, an engineer at the
Taldinski Severny open pit mine on the outskirts of Prokopyevsk.
</P>
<P>
Strike committee member Vyacheslav G. Akulov stressed that the
miners had agreed to ``interrupt the strike, not to end it.''
He said the miners would hold the government to its word: ``If
the government doesn't keep its promises, we will go back on
strike.''
The 26-member strike committee met today with a half-dozen
representatives to the national parliament and called for municipal
elections to be advanced from the spring to the first half of
November.
</P>
<P>
The last local elections in Kuznetsk were held two years ago,
before Gorbachev's reforms made elections more democratic by
offering multiple candidates.
</P>
<P>
The strike wave began 11 days ago in Kuznetsk, the country's
second-largest coal field.
</P>
<P>
Tass said late Thursday that strikes had ended at six mines in
the Donetsk region but that most mines in the area remained on
strike.
</P>
<P>
Miners at three shafts in Chervonograd, near the Polish border,
joined the walkout Thursday night, said Anatoly M. Dotsenko, a
spokesman for the Ukrainian Helsinki Watch Group.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry employs more than 1 million workers.
</P>
<P>
Tass today quoted Coal Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov as saying
the government agreed to make all Soviet coal operations
economically and legally independent.
</P>
<P>
He said authorities had agreed to additional payments for night
and evening shifts and to give workers Sundays off.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Aug. 1, mines and other industries in the ``coal
mining complex'' will gain the right to sell for negotiated prices
in the USSR and abroad products which they make over and above the
state plan,'' Tass quoted the agreement as stipulating.
</P>
<P>
It said local managers will be able to raise coal prices to
reflect actual production costs.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is trying to end the longtime Soviet practice of
setting prices for goods that bear no relation to their free-market
value and encourage and end to central control of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Akulov said that beginning Jan. 1, the Kuznetzk coal basin will
become economically autonomous.
``The Coal Mining Ministry will continue to run the mines, but
the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels
and allocating the profits,'' he said.
``Our politics have gotten freer under perestroika,'' Akulov
said of Gorbachev's economic reform program. ``But our living
conditions have not improved.''
Until Gorbachev rose to power in 1985, strikes were not
tolerated.

<P>
Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region
are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments,
the Soviet news media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises of
improved living and job conditions.
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuel
rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.
</P>
<P>
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced a bill in parliament that
would increase pension benefits by about 40 percent and upgrade
benefits for coal miners, the official Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Komsomolskaya Pravda youth newspaper, in an article giving a
sympathetic view of the workers condition's in the Arctic Cirle
coal-mining districts, said many miners do not see daylight for
months because of their underground work and the sun dips below the
horizon in the winter.
</P>
<P>
A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that the latest round of
strikes is illegal but did not impose any penalties. The miners's
unions said the decision will be appealed.
</P>
<P>
Coal miners in the northern region and the Ukraine struck for
two weeks this summer but returned to work in July after parliament
passed a resolution promising reforms, including improved social
and economic conditions. The miners say the government has renedged
on its promises.
</P>
<P>
The news media gave these accounts of the latest strikes:
Workers at the Vorgashor mine in the Arctic Circle, the largest
mine in the Vorkuta region, continued their strike for an eighth
day, according to Tass.
</P>
<P>
Komsomolskaya Pravda said night-shift workers walked out at
three mines in Vorkuta and at another one the miners were still
working but were preventing the coal from being shipped outside the
region.
</P>
<P>
In the Ukraine's Donetsk Coal Basin, the nation's major
coal-producing area, miner representatives were discussing another
strike. Tens of thousands of miners walked off the job for two
hours Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tass said that in Donetsk the miners gathered in front of the
House of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline for
implementing reforms.

Donetsk Oblast [no date as received] - As UNIAN 
reported, miners at the "Ordzhonikidzevuhillya" coal production 
association and the "Yenakiyevo" and "Poltava" pits went on 
strike in Yenakiyevo on 27 June, demanding payment of wage 
arrears. The strike continued at these mines on 28 June. Some 
of the miners at the Karl Marx, "Chernovonyy Zhovten," 
"Chervonyy Profinter," and "Yunkom" pits joined the strike. A 
total of 1,200 of the association's 2,248 workers are on strike. 
</P>
<P>
A rally consisting of 350 miners was held on 28 June near the 
town council building where demands were made to pay the wages 
and dismiss the director general of the "Ordzhonikidzevuhillya" 
production association. 
</P>
<P>
A strike committee consisting of 12 persons was elected (one 
of the members is a former Komsomol leader and former USSR 
people's deputy Viktor Honcharov) and it was decided to continue 
the strike until the demands that had been raised have been 
completely fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
On 28 June, 118 of 258 workers on the second shift at the 
"PivdennoDonbass" mine of the "Donetskvuhillya" production 
association in the town of Ugledar refused to start work for the 
same reasons - delay in paying wages. After a meeting with the 
mine's director, who promised to pay the arrears, the miners on 
the third shift returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
On 27 June, all miners on the fourth shift at the "Karbomid" 
and "Pervomaysk" mines in Pervomaysk, Lugansk oblast, refused to 
start work (142 and 157 miners respectively). 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of the mine's representatives, who wished not 
to be identified, the strike has a clear political hue - to 
attempt to compromise the existing authorities and, 
particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round 
of presidential elections. According to some reports, among the 
leaders of the striking pits there are members of the 
Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Bloc of Reforms. 
</P>
<P>
As Kostyantyn Fesenko, chairman of the coal industry workers 
trade union, informed a UNIAN correspondent, Viktor Yushchenko, 
the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, in a telephone 
conversation on 29 June, gave assurances that the money for the 
miners' wages as well as subsidies for the following month would 
be found and forwarded in the next few days.

FT  21 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poland's copper combine hit by
strike
</HL>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
WORKERS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday
as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's
pits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions
representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage
increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages
by 20 per cent. Further increases could only come if the government eased
prohibitive wage control taxes, thus providing a powerful precedent for wage
demands by other groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a
clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scattered
stoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that
cash strapped managements can ill afford.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coal
mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as the
government moved to control the budget deficit. The industry is experiencing
a coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amounting to some
12m tonnes, the equivalent of a month's output.
</P>
<P>
This has led to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' incomes and led
to the present bout of unrest. Polish mines produced 69.7m tonnes of coal in
the first half of the year or 1.5 per cent less than in the same period last
year. Meanwhile KGHM produced 197,000 tonnes of refined copper in the same
period or 3.9 per cent more than in the first half of 1991.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Romanian coal miners flex their muscles

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform
rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike,
pressing the government for higher wages.
</P>
<P>
But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in. It has
instead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered its
second week, declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
The miners' position seems untenable. Romanians appear solidly opposed to
the strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the
equivalent of Dollars 290 a month. Most workers earn less than Dollars 80.
</P>
<P>
Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored
appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each
year in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy. The
region's coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants, which
together account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity,
could also be run using lignite and gas.
</P>
<P>
The ministry further argues that the miners are in danger of pricing their
coal out of the market. According to the ministry, if the miners' pay
demands were met, the cost of their coal would double. Even at present
prices, Ukrainian coal is being imported to the Romanian market.
</P>
<P>
The strike seems motivated by a number of factors. The rank and file have
come out because they want more money to compensate for the difficult
conditions in which they live and work.
</P>
<P>
They are also following the call of their charismatic leader, Mr Miron
Cosma, the man who led them on protests to Bucharest and secured their
earlier wage increases.
</P>
<P>
Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he has
the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.
</P>
<P>
The ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into
charges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH company
officials. The company's chief accountant and budget director have already
been fired, following earlier investigations.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Industry officials argue the strike could be an attempt to
divert attention from the investigations.
</P>
<P>
Mr Cosma, however, appears confident. One of his bargaining tools is the
threat, albeit veiled, of fresh violence.
</P>
<P>
In response to the question as to whether he intends to lead his men, who
appear to support him whole-heartedly, to Bucharest again, he says: 'With
miners, anything is possible.'
But he is also making political threats. In recent months, Mr Cosma has
claimed he has evidence that senior government officials, including
President Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to
consolidate their own power.
</P>
<P>
Mr Cosma appears increasingly willing to talk if his demands are not met. It
remains to be seen whether those involved in the incidents of 1990 and 1991
now feel confident enough to ignore him.

A one-day strike by coal miners in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine has grown into a
nationwide walkout involving up to 100,000 miners demanding President Mikhail
Gorbachev surrender power to the restive republics, a union leader said
Friday.;    "The government doesn't want to negotiate with us. They understand
that we're not like the phony unions they had before," said Pavel Shushpanov,
chairman of the executive committee of the 5-month-old Independent Union of
Miners.  
</P>
<P>
Most of the country's 1.2 million coal miners are still working, but output
in some key regions has been halved, saddling Gorbachev with a substantial
labor and fuel problem even as he struggles to revive the Soviet economy.;   
The strike is the new union's first major test of strength. It began March 1
as a warning action in the Karaganda coal field of Kazakhstan and the
Krasnoarmeisk area of the Ukraine but gradually spread to all of the country's
major coal regions.;    The strikers are seeking wage increases of at least
100 percent, better working conditions and earlier retirement. They claim the
government has not kept promises it made to raise miners' living standards as
settlement of a nationwide coal strike in July 1989.;    The 1989 strike,
which involved more than 500,000 miners, made only economic demands. This
time, Shushpanov said, the miners also want three major political
concessions.;    First, he said, they want "real sovereignty" for the 15
Soviet republics. They are unhappy with Gorbachev's proposed Union Treaty,
which would leave the central government in control of the economy, defense,
foreign policy and communications, he said.;    Second, the union is demanding
more power for Gorbachev's Federation Council, which includes the presidents
of all the republics.;    Finally, the union wants a "law on property" that
would define what belongs to the government and allow private ownership of
land and industry, including some mines, he said.;    According to the state
news agency Tass, the strike has spread to the Donetsk coal basin of the
Ukraine, the Vorkuta and Inta regions of northern Russia, and the Kuznetsk
coal basin of western Siberia.

The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation. 
</P>
<P>
The strike initially would cover more than half of South Africa's gold mines and about one-fifth of its coal mines, said Cyril Ramaphosa, the union's general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
If workers in mines not included in current negotiations join in sympathy strikes, a total of 300,000 miners could be on strike, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and coal account for more than half of South Africa's foreign-currency earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The union's announcement produced little immediate reaction on South African financial markets, where analysts said a strike had been expected and probably wouldn't have much impact unless it lasted more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Mine owners reportedly have been building stockpiles for several weeks in anticipation of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Mining companies' shares rose along with the price of gold, but the metal's rise came mainly in reaction to increased tensions in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The South African rand was slightly firmer. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Ramaphosa said the union is demanding a 30%, across-the-board wage increase for black miners, who the union says earn an average of 225 rand ($109) a month. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Mines, which represents the nation's six biggest mining houses, says black miners earn about twice that much. 
</P>
<P>
It implemented wage increases ranging from 15% to 23.4% last month. 
</P>
<P>
Anglo American Corp., the huge South African mining house, warned against a strike, saying miners had received a good wage increase in July and wouldn't gain further raises by a job action. 
</P>
<P>
But "at this stage it seems the strike seems inevitable," said Mr. Ramaphosa, who added that there hadn't been any negotiations with management since a strike ballot received "overwhelming support" during the week of July 12. 
</P>
<P>
He also warned of possible confrontations with police, saying: "We have issued instructions to our members that if they are attacked they should defend themselves." 
Miners' strikes in recent years have featured clashes with police, leaving dozens of people dead. 
</P>
<P>
"The total mines that will be affected are 28 gold mines around the country and 18 collieries," the union official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our union is at the same time in dispute with a number of other companies, where strike action could take place at any time, should the various mine managements refuse to accede to our members' demands." 
He said such other companies included De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's largest diamond miner. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the general wage increase, Mr. Ramaphosa said the union is demanding pay for black miners doing dangerous work. 
</P>
<P>
The black miners also are asking for 30 days' leave each year, and a paid holiday on June 16, the anniversary of the 1976 Soweto riots. 
</P>
<P>
They also want an increase in death benefits to five years from two.
