<P>
Former East German leader Erich
Honecker may be moved to a monastery to protect him from a possible
lynching by enraged citizens, a newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a front-page story, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said
``Lynch Danger _ Church Wants to Grant Honecker Asylum.''
Since Honecker was ousted Oct. 18, the former Communist Party
leader and other party officials have come under investigation for
charges of corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.
</P>
<P>
In December, seven former Politburo members were arrested, and
Honecker was placed under house arrest in the government housing
area of Wandlitz outside East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The Wandlitz homes, including the one in which Honecker still
lives, are being converted to a medical rehabilitation center for
children. Honecker is expected to be forced out of the compound in
February.
</P>
<P>
Bild said it had information that ``Lutheran and Catholic church
sources have offered Honecker _ who is threated by public rage _
protection and refuge.''
``This is the only possibility to protect Erich Honecker from
the rage of the East German people,'' Bild quoted the source as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It was the churches that became the venues for gathering of
pro-democracy groups that eventually brought the overthrow of his
18-year leadership.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, East German groups have called for punishing
Honecker and for moving him to smaller quarters ``with an outside
toilet,'' Bild said.
</P>
<P>
The current leadership fears that in such a situation, Honecker
``might be attacked and become a victim of lynch justice,'' Bild
said.
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, underwent gall-bladder surgery in August, and East
German media reported he remains seriously ill.
``Sources say the ailing ex-leader may be placed in a
church-operated home for the elderly, or even in a monastery,''
Bild reported.

Honecker's Final Weeks In Power Described

<P>
As protests gathered strength last fall, East
Germany's longtime orthodox leader Erich Honecker ``lost touch with
reality,'' according to the man who succeeded him as Communist
leader only to be ousted later.
</P>
<P>
Egon Krenz, the successor, and former Politburo member Guenter
Schabowski on Wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentality
that engulfed the hard-liners toward the end.
``There was the notion in the former party leadership that
everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by
the Communist youth group was an action organized by enemy
forces,'' Krenz told an investigating commission in East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The testimony was broadcast on East German television.
</P>
<P>
Schabowski said Honecker had personally ordered police attacks
against demonstrators in early October, working closely with his
then-secret police chief, Erich Mielke.
``Honecker took things into his own hands,'' Schabowski said.
``All decisions and orders that led to the police actions against
demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through
Honecker and Mielke.''
Like Krenz, Schabowski denied any personal responsibility for
the orders to attack the demonstrators in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The attempts at suppression were engineered by Honecker and
Mielke, bypassing the other 19 members of the ruling Politburo,
Krenz insisted.
``Then-general secretary Erich Honecker and the internal
security chief Erich Mielke immediately after each session of the
Politburo consulted with each other on the security situation of
the German Democratic Republic,'' Krenz said.
</P>
<P>
Honecker and Mielke are now targeted for an indictment for high
treason.
</P>
<P>
The East Berlin city government commission is probing possible
criminal charges stemming from police brutality during the October
attacks in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Club-swinging riot police brutally beat demonstrators on Oct. 7
and 8, when Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in town to
commemorate the country's 40th anniversary. The uprising was a
turning point that speeded Honecker's downfall 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
Krenz, who had responsibility for many internal security
functions before Honecker's ouster, criticized the use of force
during his testimony Wednesday.
``The excessive action of law enforcement authorities was
neither politically nor morally justifiable,'' he told the panel,
speaking confidently and wearing a gray suit.
</P>
<P>
Krenz, who was thrown out six weeks after succeeding Honecker on
Oct. 18, insisted he knew nothing about any orders to shoot
demonstrators. Numerous news media accounts have said Honecker
either planned or issued such orders.
</P>
<P>
Krenz said he accepted ``joint responsibility for misjudging
dissident citizens and dissident groups for years.''
``From today's viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was
no general Politburo discussion about the negative developments
then taking place in society,'' said Krenz, an influential
Politburo member even before Honecker's fall.
</P>
<P>
Krenz added that he and other then-members of the Politburo
failed to realize that the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches
were ``not working against but rather for the German Democratic
Republic.''
``Honecker had lost touch with reality and had unrealistic
perspectives,'' Krenz said of his one-time patron, who for years
treated him like a son.
</P>
<P>
Honecker has been in ill health following gallbladder surgery
last summer. He was recently operated on for a malignant kidney
tumor.
</P>
<P>
Krenz's current occupation has not been publicized, following
his fall as party chief on Dec. 3.

Honecker Arrested, Taken to Prison
</HL>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who
is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday
morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the
official news agency ADN said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the 77-year-old Honecker was arrested after
being released from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had
undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
</P>
<P>
Honecker was immediately taken to East Berlin's Rummelsburg
prison, the brief dispatch said. Honecker joins other members of
his ousted Politburo already in prison awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker and
former state security chief Erich Mielke would be charged with
treason and corruption charges for misuse of their positions and
state funds.
</P>
<P>
Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East
Germany for 18 years until his ouster on Oct. 18, had previously
been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
ADN said that the director of Charite urology clinic, Dr. Peter
Althaus, repeated on Monday that in his opinion Honecker was still
not well enough to be jailed.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said
Honecker would be arrested, but that he would be held at a prison
hospital because of his condition. ADN made not mention if
Rummelsburg prison was equipped with a medical facility.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, East Germany's Luthern Church had offered to
put Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the
hospital.

<P>
Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was
arrested and taken to prison today, and a prosecutor said he will
tried for high treason in March.
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, was detained after his release from East Berlin's
Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant
kidney tumor, the official ADN news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph told Parliament that
Honecker and former Politburo members Erich Mielke, Guenter Mittag
and Joachim Herrmann would be tried by the Supreme Court on treason
charges in March. All four have been expelled from the party.
</P>
<P>
Mielke was Honecker's security chief, Mittag oversaw the economy
and Herrmann headed the party's propaganda department. Eleven
members of Honecker's ousted Politburo already are in prison
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
Honecker's lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, asked the chief prosecutor to
free the former leader from Rummelburg prison based on a doctor's
statement that he is too ill to stay in jail, ADN said. Vogel is
East Germany's most prominent lawyer.
</P>
<P>
One of Honecker's doctors, Horst Vogler, said the former leader
was ``very depressed'' and his mental state ``impaired'' following
two major surgical operations since August.
</P>
<P>
West German television showed an impassive Honecker being led
out of the hospital by his wife, Margot, in pre-dawn darkness. She
kissed him goodbye before he was taken away in a large limousine.
</P>
<P>
Honecker's daughter, son-in-law and youngest grandchild also
came to see him off at the hospital, ADN quoted Vogler as saying.
</P>
<P>
The charge of high treason carries a maximum life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The conviction used to carry the death penalty, but that was
abolished in reforms that followed Honecker's ouster Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
East Germany has been caught up in a virtual frenzy to root out
corruption and abuse of office.
</P>
<P>
Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East
Germany for 18 years, had previously been declared too ill to
withstand imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
ADN said the director of Charite urology clinic, Dr. Peter
Althaus, repeated today that in his opinion Honecker is still not

Panel: Honecker Unfit to be Held but Fit to be Tried
</HL>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich
Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be
tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
ADN, quoting a Health Ministry statement, said Honecker was
still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in January and was
not well enough to be incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
But a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition
to be questioned and to stand trial, ADN said.
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was
ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept
the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist
government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist
officials, who had been among Honecker's closest aides, were all
fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.
</P>
<P>
It said former secret police chief Erich Mielke, former
economics czar Guenter Mittag and former labor chief Harry Tisch
were under arrest, while the other four remained free. All three
had been members of the ruling Politburo under Honecker. Mielke was
arrested on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Honecker and the seven are charged with corruption and abuse of
office. They had been arrested soon after Honecker's fall but were
later released because of advanced age and poor health.
</P>
<P>
Honecker has been staying at a Soviet military hospital outside
East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
ADN quoted Federal Prosecutor Guenter Seidel as saying he
intended to continue his investigation against the former East
German leaders, although their poor health often disrupted the
proceedings.

Authorities Interrogate Honecker in Murder Probe
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany authorities on Friday
interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his role
in the killings of people who tried to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
Honecker and Erich Mielke, head of East Germany's once-feared
secret police agency, were interrogated by federal prosecutors,
said Peter Przybylski, a Justice Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land mines
as they tried to escape from East Germany's Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
The government announced in June that Honecker, Mielke and
several border guards would be investigated on possible murder
charges in connection with those deaths.
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77 and in failing health, and several other members of
his ousted regime already have been charged with corruption and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The murder charge could put Honecker behind bars for life, but
his poor health makes prosecution questionable. He is staying in a
Soviet hospital outside Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a medical panel ruled that Honecker was too ill to
be jailed pending investigation but fit enough to be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Mielke was ordered jailed.
</P>
<P>
East Germany's democratic government has changed its mind
several times on whether to pursue charges against the aging
members of the former hard-line regime that was toppled in last
autumn's pro-democracy protests.

Report: Honecker Unlikely To Go to Trial in East Germany
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will
not stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist
country exists, a West German newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag said Saturday that it would
report in its Sunday editions that Honecker could be prosecuted in
a united Germany, however, for violation of property laws.
</P>
<P>
Bild quoted Guenter Seidel, an East German prosecutor, as saying
that Honecker had used $42 million for stocking a private housing
estate for leaders of the former Communist government.
</P>
<P>
However, Seidel said that the investigation was not far enough
along to determine whether charges could be filed against Honecker
before East Germany merges with West Germany on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators are still working out the merger of the two German
legal systems.
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 78, was ousted as East Germany's leader on Oct. 18,
paving the way for the country's first freely elected government in
March. Honecker is in poor health and remains confined to a Soviet
military hospital in Beelitz outside East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
He is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power,
corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot-to-kill orders
to prevent East Germans from escaping to West Germany when he
served as the country's leader.
</P>
<P>
Bild said that Erich Mielke, the ex-head of East Germany's
former secret police, was also unlikely to go to court in East
Germany.
``I am at the end. I am a dead man,'' Bild quoted Mielke, 82, as
saying at his last interrogation.

Report: Ousted Stasi Chief Threatened Honecker in Jail
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's ousted secret police
chief threatened to break former Communist leader Erich Honecker's
neck when the two faced each other in jail, a West German newspaper
reported Wednesday.
``You traitor!'' 82-year-old former security chief Erich Mielke
shouted at Honecker, according to Bild newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Mielke also screamed at Honecker ``I'll break your neck!'' the
newspaper quoted witnesses as describing the scene when the two met
in an East German jail. Honecker, 78, was jailed for one day in
January.
</P>
<P>
Mielke for years headed the dreaded secret police, known as
Stasi, which built up files on 6 million East Germans and kept a
tight rein on the population. He was one of Honecker's closest
aides.
</P>
<P>
After the popular revolt last fall that ousted the Communist
regime and opened the way to German unification, Mielke and other
former Communist leaders were jailed.
</P>
<P>
Mielke remains in custody. Honecker was released from jail for
health reasons.
</P>
<P>
West German authorities on Tuesday opened a criminal
investigation of Mielke. He is suspected of giving sanctuary to
members of West Germany's leftist terrorist group, the Red Army
Faction, and of setting up contacts between the group and
Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Honecker is also the target of several criminal investigations,
one in West Germany for obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Bild said the imprisoned Mielke also accused other former
Communist officials of betrayal and threatened to retaliate against
them.
</P>
<P>
One prison warden told Bild that many of the guards had worked
for Mielke's Stasi and that they might interpret his threat against
Honecker as an order to kill the former Communist chief.
</P>
<P>
Bild said Mielke and other members of Honecker's ruling circle
will be moved to a West Berlin prison after German unification on
Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
Honecker also will be moved to the same jail if his health
improves enough for him to be imprisoned. He is suffering from
kidney cancer and is being kept at a Soviet military hospital
oustide East Berlin.

Report: High-Ranking German Demands Soviets Hand Over Honecker
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker,
who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Federal lawmaker Johannes Gerster said refusal to turn over the
deposed East German leader for trial could ``burden'' Bonn and
Moscow's ``outstanding relations,'' the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker, 78, on
the manslaughter charges. He is accused of issuing shoot-to-kill
orders to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
Honecker has denied all charges against him, including that he
was personally responsible for the estimated 200 people who died
trying to escape his repressive government.
</P>
<P>
He has taken refuge at a Soviet military hospital in Beelitz,
outside Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have said Honecker is staying at the hospital
for humanitarian reasons, and German police need permission from
the Soviets to gain entry.
``I demand that the Soviet government immediately release Erich
Honecker and extradite him to German justice officials,'' the
Osnabrueck newspaper quoted Gerster, a member of Kohl's Christian
Democrats, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Honecker's fate is one of the first issues facing Bonn and
Moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two
nations closer together.

   Erich Honecker Dies in Chile 29 May

<TEXT>

BFN 
Berlin - Erich Honecker, the former GDR head of 
state, died at his house in Santiago, Chile on Sunday morning 
[29 May], according to his lawyer. Lawyer Nicolas Becker, who 
had represented 81-year-old Honecker before the Berlin court in 
1992 and early 1993, told DPA on Sunday afternoon that Honecker 
had rejected an operation. However, everything that was 
sensible had been done with regard to his cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Becker could not comment on the exact cause of Honecker's 
death. His colleague, Wolfgang Ziegler, had said earlier that 
the former most powerful man in the GDR had obviously died from 
his liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said he did not know whether Honecker has left a will 
or where the funeral would be held. This will be decided by the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he cannot say whether Margot Honecker, who had 
informed Becker of her husband's death, will be allowed to stay 
in Chile. After being released from prison in 1993, Honecker 
had traveled to Santiago to join his daughter, who is married to 
a Chilean. Since then, he and his wife had been living in a 
house in a wealthy Santiago area.

  HONECKER FATE STILL UNDECIDED
GORBACHEV URGES A GO-SLOW APPROACH  
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev urged all sides Tuesday to take their time in deciding the
fate of Erich Honecker, as the fugitive former East German leader spent a
seventh day of refuge inside the Chilean Embassy.;   A day after the Russian
government backed down from its threat to expel him, diplomats sought to
settle the fate of the 79-year-old Honecker.  
</P>
<P>
Germany wants to try him for ordering the shooting of people who attempted
to flee to the West during his years in power. But speculation lingers that
German politicians have little real interest in trying a man who may possess
embarrassing secrets.;   "Let's forget about the issue of Erich Honecker for
several days. Let's hope this special issue will be resolved," Gorbachev's
spokesman, Andrei Grachev, quoted the Soviet president as telling German
media.;   But Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying he did not exclude the
possibility that Honecker would leave Russia for North Korea in the next few
days.;   Gorbachev had served as Honecker's protector until the Soviet
leader's political fortunes declined. Last week Russia abruptly ordered
Honecker to leave the country or face expulsion.;   North Korean and Russian
diplomats confirmed that talks were held Tuesday about a North Korean offer
for Honecker to travel to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, for medical
treatment.;   Li Cher Gvan, a consul at the North Korean Embassy, said a
commercial North Korean airliner remained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport
ready to fly Honecker to Pyongyang. But he said his country was still awaiting
a positive reply from the Russian government on the offer to accept Honecker.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said it had not yet formulated a response.;  
Outside the Chilean Embassy, several dozen demonstrators continued their
vigil, demanding humane treatment for Honecker.
