Historic Turkish Wreck Located Off Greek Island
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath
the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden
Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the
island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical
accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter
Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert.
</P>
<P>
The Bourloti Seimaz _ or ``Explosives Invincible'' _ was set
afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for
Turkish killing and looting on Chios.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked
other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek
struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Greece won
independence in 1830.
</P>
<P>
The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture,
``The Massacre of Chios,'' based on the raids.
``It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book
we used to read in school about the War of Independence,''
Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Nicolaides, who heard about the wreck while teaching an
underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter, started
querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
He pinpointed the wreck on May 3, he said.
``When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking out of the muddy
seabed and dozens of objects _ Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls,
a candlestick, even a chalice from a Greek Orthodox church,'' he
said.
``The ship was obviously crammed with loot from Chios. I think
there may be gold and silver items as well,'' he said. ``I also saw
what I recognized as human bones,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet
in length.
</P>
<P>
According to historians, more than 1,000 people _ including 400
Greek captives _ were aboard the ship when Kanaris staged his
attack in the early hours of June 7, 1822.
</P>
<P>
The Greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of Psara, towing
a boat stuffed with explosives. Its pointed bow was rammed into the
mouth of a cannon on the Bourloti Seimaz and a fuse lit.
</P>
<P>
The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, was killed in the blast
that split the ship. Kanaris and his crew of Greeks escaped.
``This is a very significant, very emotive find, coming from
this particular period of history,'' said George
Papathanassopoulos, the Culture Ministry's adviser on marine
archaeology.
</P>
<P>
Papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site
will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology
rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet, but he said, ``This is
a ship that must be explored.''
Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap American
and Turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international
project.
</P>
<P>
American experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at
Texas A 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
M University, working in cooperation with Turkish divers,
have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast.
</P>
<P>
Greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying
historic wrecks scattered around the Aegean and rarely carry out
excavations.

Ship Sinks, Crew Rescued

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A freighter carrying a cargo of
beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine
crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The ship sank at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28
nautical miles north of the island of Ameland.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29
miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard
spokesman, who was not identified. There were no casualties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview,
identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra
and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer. He did not give the
ship's origin or destination.
</P>
<P>
The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking
in high winds. They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter
from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the
sinking, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the
scene.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry,
possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes
between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.
</P>
<P>
Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its
vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in
West Germany.

Parliamentary President Resigns Under Pressure
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament
and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party,
resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of
ship 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down
because of his alleged involvement in the so-called ``Lucona''
scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a
parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Karl Blecha, like Gratz a onetime protege of
former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, resigned Jan.19.
</P>
<P>
Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch,
the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian
Ocean. Six sailors died.
</P>
<P>
The Lucona's cargo was officially described by Proksch as for a
uranium processing plant and insured for $16 million.
</P>
<P>
The insurance company has never paid, claiming the cargo was only
scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to
collect the insurance money.
</P>
<P>
Proksch, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and
insurance fraud, has been variously described to be living in Syria,
the Philippines and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
In several interviews, Gratz described himself as a close friend
of Proksch, but when Proksch fled to escape prosecution, Gratz
criticized him.
</P>
<P>
Gratz told Parliament today he would give up his seat in
February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious
posts in Austria.
``My decision is a personal one and it is politically
motivated,'' Gratz told the house.
``If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take
a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of
parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context
in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council
(parliament) in such a way as is his duty.'' In past newspaper
stories, Gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from
abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment
was for a uranium processing plant.
</P>
<P>
Gratz, who denied the allegations, was also accused of helping
Proksch in several other ways. Like Blecha, Gratz is to appear
before the parliamentary investigation committee.

Argentine Ship Sinks Off Antarctica

<TEXT>
<P>
An Argentine supply ship that ran
aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds,
the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could
leak and damage the environment.
</P>
<P>
The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from
the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic
could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel
aboard the ship were to spill.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the
crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south
of Cape Horn, the tip of South America. Salvage efforts had been
hampered by 50 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the
government news agency Telam said, citing a navy communique. Telam
did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when
it went down.
</P>
<P>
The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline
and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science
Foundation said in a statement released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer
Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the
continent's tip. It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and
some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing
ashore near Palmer station.
</P>
<P>
The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a
vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins,
sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation
statement said.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the
wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
</P>
<P>
Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank
that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife,
had stopped.
``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may
already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement
said. It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive
Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
</P>
<P>
Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82
passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and
taken to Palmer Station.
</P>
<P>
The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to
the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the
South American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the
station, said Renerie.
</P>
<P>
Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been
rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement
said.

<P>
Two sailors were missing Monday evening after a
652-foot freighter en route from Greece apparently sank in rough
seas 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod. Twenty-three crew members
were rescued.
</P>
<P>
The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria were found on a
lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast
Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York.
``They're all in good shape, some minor cuts and scrapes,''
Midgett said.
</P>
<P>
The two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft,
which was the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot
Ravenscraig and five Navy and Coast Guard search planes, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ravenscraig's crew spotted a second life raft, but it turned
out to be empty.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the sinking was not immediately known, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The Star of Alexandria had been en route from Athens, Greece, to
New York with a load of cement when it began taking on water in
12-foot seas and winds up to 35 mph, Midgett said. The first mayday
call went out at 9:05 a.m.
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a C-130
plane from Elizabeth City, N.C., converged on the ship. The
lifeboat was spotted around noon.
</P>
<P>
The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat
carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish
communications, Midgett said. About four hours later, they were
rescued by the Ravenscraig.
</P>
<P>
The Star of Alexandria was not spotted, and was presumed to be
sinking or sunk, Midgett said. Visibility in the rough seas was
five to eight miles Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Star of Alexandria was built in 1966, and was registered in
England. It was designed to carry bulk freight, and was owned by
Caribene Investments Ltd. of Gibraltar, according to Bureau
Veritas, a Paris-based shipping registry.
</P>
<P>
The Ravenscraig had been bound for England, but its destination
after its rescue mission was not immediately known.

Hitler Yacht Sunk in Wrong Spot, Must Be Moved
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A yacht built for Adolf Hitler and sunk
with great fanfare to commemorate the ``Voyage of the Damned'' was
mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping
lane, officials said Tuesday.
``They're going to have to move it,'' said Coast Guard
spokeswoman Veronica Cady.
</P>
<P>
The 85-foot Ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial
reef in 250 feet of water about two miles off the coast.
</P>
<P>
It was sunk June 4, 50 years after the U.S. Coast Guard turned
away the SS St. Louis as its more than 900 Jewish passengers were
seeking refuge from the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
The sinking site was supposed to be near where the Coast Guard
intercepted the St. Louis, whose passengers also were turned away by
Cuba and forced to return to Europe. Most of the passengers later
died in Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
For unexplained reasons, the Ostwind was pushed off a barge about
a mile north of the site, and is resting in 25 feet of water on a
living reef.
``It was truly an incredible, incredible historic event, and
suddenly _ boom! _ somebody made a mistake,'' said Mayor Abe
Resnick, a Holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event.
</P>
<P>
Federal and Dade County officials who allowed Resnick to sink the
boat are upset about the result.
``They didn't even come close,'' complained Susan Markely, an
administrator with Dade's environmental department.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Lt. Al Crespo said the yacht is balanced on a
delicate living reef, threatening damage to coral and sponges. It's
also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels
heading to the port of Miami and has been marked with a flashing
buoy, he said.
``It's close enough that if a ship swings on its anchor, it could
hit it,'' Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers said the Ostwind must be moved or cut
to pieces by June 22. If it's not, the government will remove it and
bill Resnick.
</P>
<P>
Resnick blames the mistake on A.M. Daly Jr., captain of the tug
that towed the yacht to where it was sunk.
</P>
<P>
Daly, however, said Chris Cadley, captain of a passenger boat
that accompanied him, had agreed to lead him to the site.
</P>
<P>
Cadley denied that, saying he only agreed to meet Daly off the
coast.
</P>
<P>
Resnick said someone will have to pay.
``I think's that's going to end up being decided by attorneys,''
said Ben Mostkoff, the county's artificial reef director.
</P>
<P>
The Ostwind was built at Hitler's direction, although he rarely
used it. After World War II, the badly decayed boat wound up in the
hands of a Jacksonville marina owner.

Nazis Scuttled the Ship, Discover Says; He Leaves Its Fate to Germans

<P>
A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests
that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was
scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a
celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his
ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck ``sitting upright and
proud'' two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British
background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed
himself to the German people in German.
``I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter,'' he said,
translating himself back into English. ``We found no human remains.
</P>
<P>
We touched nothing and took nothing. ... The future of the Bismarck
is in the hands of the German people.''
He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so
Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship,
which sank after a battle May 27, 1941.
</P>
<P>
Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him
that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to
surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire.
``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German
pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the
neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ships.
</P>
<P>
Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the
secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons.
</P>
<P>
In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked
out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her
secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking
hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered
British biplanes, it was unable to escape.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by
ceasing fire, Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas
it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized
that the Germans were giving up.
</P>
<P>
Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's
technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands.
</P>
<P>
The Bismarck was found by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of
water about 600 miles west of Brest, France. He said it was in
remarkably good shape, ``elegant, well preserved.''
Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had
left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit
with a ringing three-word command: ``Sink the Bismarck!''
Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
</P>
<P>
British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of
German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might
have been a German U-boat. German vessels later rescued only five
more survivors.
</P>
<P>
The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie.
</P>
<P>
The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation. If unstopped, it could have
posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut
British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against
combined German sea and air power.
</P>
<P>
The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within
five days of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a
three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the
vessel's crew of 1,419.
</P>
<P>
The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of crucial importance.
</P>
<P>
Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the
property of the German people.
</P>
<P>
The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same
remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago to find the
wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912
after striking an iceberg.

<P>
A Florida couple said their pleasure boat
was sunk by whales off Costa Rica and they survived 66 days at sea
by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the U.S. Coast Guard
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, were ``weak
but recovering'' at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being
rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, said
U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo.
</P>
<P>
The survivors told authorities they lost about 50 pounds each
from the ordeal, said Vallecillo, who spoke to the couple by
telephone early Sunday. The U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Command is
headquartered in Alameda, 10 miles east of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
William Butler told Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure
boat Sibonay was attacked and sunk by ``several'' whales on June 15
about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
``They were large, according to Mr. Butler,'' Vallecillo said.
``But he didn't know how many whales.''
The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to
their daughter in Miami, the Coast Guard spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Vallecillo said he'd heard of boats running into marine mammals
when there's poor visibility, but isn't sure if there are any
recorded cases of whale aggression.
``This happened in the early morning hours'' with good
visibility, he said. ``This is the first (case) I've documented.''
As the boat was sinking, the couple said, they grabbed fishing
rods and a salt-water purifier and and got into a rubber lifeboat,
where they remained for the next two months, Vallecillo said.
</P>
<P>
As the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two months, the
Butlers said, they caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and
survived multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft
repair kit.
</P>
<P>
Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times the
couple spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship making its ``fisheries'' patrol
about 30 miles off the coast of Golfito spotted the raft and rescued
the couple.
</P>
<P>
They were sailing from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to
Honolulu, where they planned to vacation, Vallecillo said. Butler is
an experienced sailor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Their daughter, Sally Smith, and son, Bill Butler, were flying to
Costa Rica on Sunday evening to be reunited with their parents,
Vallecillo said.

   Navy Says Fishing Boat `Sunk by Its Own Crew'

BFN 
Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) - Today, the Foreign 
Ministry said that control operations carried out by the 
corvette Spiro against a Korean-flagged [as received] ship 
fishing illegally in Argentine waters were carried out "in 
accordance with international law and in coordination with the 
Foreign Ministry." 
The Foreign Ministry thus approved the intervention by the 
Argentine corvette when it discovered the Korean ship Chin Yuan 
Hsing violating Argentine jurisdictional waters on 21 May. 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine Navy reported today that the corvette Spiro 
stayed near the Korean ship "given the adverse weather 
conditions, and fulfilling its responsibilities of sea search 
and rescue." 
The Korean ship, which had been fishing illegally in 
Argentine waters, was sunk by its own crew after failing to 
answer to the Argentine ship's warnings. 
</P>
<P>
The crew was transferred to the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was 
sailing nearby and approached to rescue the crew of the sinking 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy reported that around 15 nautical miles off the 
coast 
of Malvinas and "in accordance with bilateral agreements with 
Great Britain, the Spiro transferred assistance responsibility 
to British authorities." 
The Foreign Ministry said "an understanding with the UK for 
operations in cases of uninterrupted persecution of illegally 
fishing ships was implemented." 
The Foreign Ministry also said the policy "is in accordance 
with the growing international opinion currently giving priority 
to the preservation, regulation, and the sustainable use of 
marine live resources and the effective punishment of violators 
of national laws on the matter."

Ferries are among the safest vessels afloat. But, as the tragic sinking of
the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates, when they do
go down the toll in human life can be high.
</P>
<P>
As ferries increase in size, so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical
failure or a crew error go up. The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with
vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the
risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash
in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its
members, the ship-owning nations, have devoted much thought over the past
two decades to ship safety. But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a
new review of ferry safety. Particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports
which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of
the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987. Unlike the Herald, the
Estonia appears to have had its doors closed, but ro-ros are undoubtedly
very vulnerable to water penetration.
</P>
<P>
Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues. First the
subject of ferry design should be reconsidered. Additional stability could
be provided by the addition of sponsons, stabilising bulges which project
from the ship's side just above the water line. Greater resistance to an
influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or
bulkheads to break up the large car decks. These proposals were looked at by
the British government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free
Enterprise. It calculated that it would cost between Pounds 70m and Pounds
85m to improve standards on the 57 vessels in the UK ferry fleet, with a
further Pounds 22m in extra annual running costs.
</P>
<P>
Higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares - unwelcome to ferry
operators when, on the short cross-Channel routes, they face competition
from the Channel tunnel. But the difficulty of pushing through fare rises
would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Second, the IMO and national governments must look closely at how to improve
enforcement of existing regulations. The IMO has been trying to move
enforcement up its agenda, but it depends on the good will and
professionalism of governments and shipowners. Third, the IMO should be
given support by national governments in its campaign, launched yesterday,
to improve crew training. Much of the regulation in recent years has
concentrated on improving the ship and its equipment.
</P>
<P>
Above all, if new regulation does turn out to be necessary, it must be
introduced speedily. As things stand, it can take years before changes are
ratified by enough governments to give them force. The European Union, which
Sweden and Finland are getting ready to join, could take a lead in speeding
up the process.
</P>
<P>
Ship safety is not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector. Five
(small) ferries were lost last year, according to Lloyd's Register. But this
figure pales into insignificance compared with the 96 general cargo ships
and 12 tankers which also went down.
</P>
<P>
When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant ocean,
very little attention is paid. If the loss of a relatively modern passenger
vessel in European waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for
governments and the public, this will be some small compensation for the
loss of life from the Estonia.
