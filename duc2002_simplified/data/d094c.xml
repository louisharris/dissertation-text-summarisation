Emperor's Blood Pressure Drops Briefly
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure and pulse dropped
sharply Thursday, but the vital signs later returned to normal as
the ailing monarch's internal bleeding continued.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito, 87, discharged more blood and was given emergency
transfusions, but was resting peacefully by nightfall, an imperial
palace spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60 in the afternoon
to 112 over 50 by evening, and his pulse from 104 per minute in the
morning to 84 in the evening, said Kenji Maeda, chief of the
Imperial Household Agency's General Affairs Division.
``The emperor's blood pressure has returned to what is normal
for him, and the head court physician says he is not worried,''
Maeda said.
</P>
<P>
One of Hirohito's daughters, Atsuko Ikeda, said Wednesday the
emperor had coughed severely during her visit to him and had hardly
responded to her.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, Hirohito's two sons, Crown Prince Akihito
and Prince Hitachi, visited him, and he was fully conscious and
alert, a senior palace source said.
</P>
<P>
The monarch has been bedridden for a month with an intestinal
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
There was renewed bleeding Thursday and the pace of the
discharges was quickening, Maeda said.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito has received nearly 22{ pints of blood since his
illness worsened Sept. 19, and the transfusions had put a strain on
Hirohito's heart and kidneys, Maeda said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The only solid food Hirohito has eaten since falling ill are a
few spoonfuls of porridge. Otherwise he is being fed intravenously,
which gives him 600-700 calories a day, said the senior palace
official, who refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Before his illness, Hirohito was taking about 1,300 calories
daily, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The emperor complains of fatigue but does not appear to be in
pain, he said.
</P>
<P>
Crown Princess Michiko, Hirohito's daughter-in-law, scaled down
celebrations for her 54th birthday Thursday, canceling a
traditional birthday news conference, another palace official said.
</P>
<P>
She planned a quiet gathering with members of the imperial family,
the official said.

Emperor Hirohito has lost nearly 40 pounds in the
two months since he fell ill and now weighs only 66 pounds, a palace
official was quoted as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 87-year-old emperor's condition weakened Friday, but doctors
speculated that a scab had stopped internal bleeding in his upper
intestinal area, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji
Maeda.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not
discharged blood in nine days.
</P>
<P>
The emperor responds to queries from aides but is ``less
talkative than before,'' Maeda told reporters. He added that doctors
sometimes have trouble determining whether Hirohito is awake.
</P>
<P>
News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito has shed much of his
normal 104 pounds during his confinement and now weighs about 66
pounds.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito had a temperature of 99.1 degrees Friday evening, up
slightly from the morning. His normal temperature is about 95.9
degrees.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have said he suffers from jaundice and anemia. Maeda said
the emperor's heart and kidneys were functioning normally.
</P>
<P>
Since Sept. 19, when he was confined to intensive care after
vomiting blood, Hirohito has received 42 pints of blood in
transfusions.
</P>
<P>
Palace officials have not given details on Hirohito's illness,
and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperor
has pancreatic cancer.

The Biggest Decision of a 62-Year Reign _ Surrender in World War
II

<P>
TOKYO (AP _ Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one
overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must bow to
defeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacific
conflict in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that decision, and for most of his reign, Hirohito
became a figurehead, isolated from his subjects by tradition and
steeped in his great love, the study of marine biology. He was the
last survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era.
</P>
<P>
But in his first 20 years, the ``Son of Heaven'' was worshiped as
a divinity descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu.
</P>
<P>
The solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so
intrigued Hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who
became the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of
25 on Christmas Day 1926, designating his reign ``Showa'' _
``enlightened peace.''
The emperor was generally portrayed as having played no
significant role in planning or carrying out Japan's military
adventures in the 1930s and 1940s. But it was his first effective
decision as emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the Pacific
conflict.
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 10, 1945, four days after history's first atomic bomb
devastated Hiroshima and one day after a U.S. bomber dropped the
second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the generals and admirals of
Imperial Japan's wartime government argued for hours in the
sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the Tokyo palace.
</P>
<P>
Should Japan agree to the Allies' surrender demand, or fight on
until annihilation?
</P>
<P>
Speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and
obviously nervous monotone, Hirohito, the spiritual and titular
leader, offered his opinion for the first time. He spoke of his
sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war, and of
families who lost everything in air raids.
``I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer,'' he
said. ``Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to
relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is
burdened.''
Then, evoking a memory of his grandfather, the Emperor Meiji,
whose reign (1867-1912) saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japanese
isolation from the outside world, Hirohito told the officers:
``The time has come when we must bear the unbearable.''
In the days that followed, Hirohito continued his break with
tradition. In a national radio broadcast Aug. 15 _ the first time
ordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice _ he personally
announced the decision to surrender.
</P>
<P>
He told the ravaged nation that ``the war situation has developed
not necessarily to our advantage.''
Three weeks later, Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat, striped
trousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander, Gen. Douglas A.
</P>
<P>
MacArthur, at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. It was the first time
Hirohito had ever gone to see anyone, and the first of several calls
on the general who had led the Pacific war against Japan and became
its postwar governor.
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Day 1946, at MacArthur's insistence, the emperor
publicly renounced his divinity. It was a choice that enabled
Hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured
that he would not face charges as a war criminal, as some abroad had
demanded.
</P>
<P>
It also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this
gentle, shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a
``living god.''
The emperor's status in the eyes of many Japanese changed to that
of a kind uncle.
</P>
<P>
He became a widely respected authority on marine biology. He
possessed rare collections of marine life, discovered several
species himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 books on
hydrozoa, or sea animals, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, his life had become the subject of a popular
comic book series.
</P>
<P>
Still, Hirohito and the imperial system remained important to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in
March 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polled
supported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it should
be abolished. Five percent said the emperor should have more power.
</P>
<P>
From 1946 to 1954, Hirohito toured Japan to encourage the people
to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
The Imperial Household Agency, which ran his affairs, said
Hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling
times of his life, in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery
from a war that cost 3.1 million Japanese lives.
</P>
<P>
Despite the humanization of the Imperial family, Hirohito
remained under strict control of the Imperial Household Agency.
</P>
<P>
Protocol was maintained at nearly all times and he was prohibited
from speaking on any controversial subject.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito was born on April 29, 1901. In accordance with age-old
imperial custom, he was taken from his parents as an infant to be
reared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for one
role, that of emperor.
</P>
<P>
His education came as Japan surged into the modern world. The
feudal samurai ethic was still strong; when his grandfather died,
Gen. Maresuke Nogi, the mentor for the 11-year-old prince, calmly
committed ritual suicide to follow the emperor, his master, to the
grave.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito studied government and law with private tutors. When he
was 20, his father, Emperor Taisho, sent him abroad _ the first time
any member of the immediate imperial family was allowed outside
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito visited England, Scotland, France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Italy, receiving various decorations. He was also
received by Pope Benedict XV.
</P>
<P>
The young man handled money for the first time, paying his own
fare on the Paris subway. He developed a passion for bacon and eggs
and it became a lifelong breakfast habit. A palace chamberlain said
in a 1980 interview that Hirohito shunned Japanese food ``unless it
is forced on him by an unwitting host.''
Hirohito also acquired a preference for Western clothes. He was
never seen in public wearing traditional Japanese garb, and a palace
official confided that the Emperor of Japan did not even own a
kimono.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito became prince regent on Nov. 25, 1921, after his father
became a mental and physical invalid, became emperor five years
later and was formally enthroned in 1928.

<P>
World leaders from President Reagan to Malaysia's king mourned
today's death of Emperor Hirohito, who surrendered a broken nation
to the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economic
pre-eminence.
</P>
<P>
Reaction to Hirohito's death at age 87, however, was decidedly
cool in several Asian countries, including South Korea, which
endured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan.
</P>
<P>
While South Korea President Roh Tae-Woo sent his condolences, a
government party statement added, ``We reserve further comment,
considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan
relationship.''
The main opposition party led by Kim Dae-jung said, ``We have
complex feelings at the death of Hirohito in view of Japan's 20-year
rule over Korea during his reign.''
A leading newspaper in Seoul, The Joong-Ang Daily News, wrote
that Hirohito's death ``reminds all the Korean people of a disgraced
period and ... humiliation. ... Hirohito is the symbolic figure who
must assume most and final responsibility for (Japan's) preposterous
crimes to the Korean people.''
Korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist
south in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's rule that
began in 1910 with Japan's forced annexation of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinese
government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between
Taiwan and Japan, but the mass circulation Chinese daily United
Evening News said:
``Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of
Japan's militarists during World War II may bury their animosity
with Hirohito's death. ... Chinese suffered the most from the
Japanese invasion.
``It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the United
States and Europe for the war, he did not direct a single word to
China to show his sorrow.Now, Hirohito has died. We may not want to
collect the reparations, but we shall never forget the painful
historic lessions.''
In the United States, President Reagan said in a statement, ``His
Majesty's 62-year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous, and yet
at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind _ an
age of unprecedented economic collapse, a most vicious war,
astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic political and
social changes throughout the world.
``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majesty
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two
peoples to an end,'' Reagan said, referring to Hirohito's decision
to end World War II.
</P>
<P>
In New Zealand, Prime Minister David Lange said Hirohito's death
marks the end of an era.
``During his reign he saw the transition from the most turbulent
period in Japan's modern history to the stability and prosperity of
today,'' Lange said.
</P>
<P>
President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines sent condolences to
the imperial family and her foreign secretary, Raul Manglapus, a
Japanese prisoner of war during World War II, praised Hirohito as
``a stabilizing factor'' in the creation of a democratic Japan.
``He provided a figurehead that kept the Japanese people firmly
committed to peaceful means of achieving their national goals,''
Manglapus said.
</P>
<P>
Condolences also came from King Sultan Mahmood Iskandar of
Malaysia to Hirohito's oldest son, Crown Prince Akihito, who
immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia paid his respects in a
message to Japanese Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita: ``Throughout
his long life, the emperor was held in the highest esteem by his
people. Now, as Japan enters a period of mourning and prepares for a
new age, our thoughts are with you.''
But Bruce Ruxton, an official of the Returned Services League,
which representing almost 300,000 Australian war veterans, said
there would not ``be too many tears shed around the world.'' He
described Hirohito, whose role in the war has been debated, as ``one
of the worst war criminals.''
Marine biologists paid homage to another facet of the monarch's
life _ his 12 books published on hydrozoa, or sea animals. Robert
Hessler of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., said Hirohito preferred the quiet study to his destined role
as leader.
``The poor man didn't really get to do what he wanted to do. He
had to be emperor first, then second a scientist and normal human
being,'' Hessler said.

World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences and some
declared states of mourning after Emperor Hirohito's death Saturday,
but painful memories of World War II still generated criticism of
the Japanese monarch.
</P>
<P>
President Reagan said Hirohito's 62-year reign ``spanned one of
the most tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras in
the history of mankind.
``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majesty
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two
peoples to an end,'' Reagan said, referring to Hirohito's decision
to end World War II.
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union sent his
``sincere condolences'' and ``profound sympathy'' to the Japanese
people.
</P>
<P>
His two-sentence telegram made no mention of wartime hostilities
with what still is known officially as ``militarist Japan.'' The
Kremlin currently is striving for better ties and increased trade
with Japan.
</P>
<P>
India declared a three-day national state of mourning in honor of
Hirohito and Norway's King Olav V announced a three-week court
mourning. President Francois Mitterrand of France opened an
international conference on chemical weapons with a minute of
silence.
</P>
<P>
But some reaction to Hirohito's death was cool in South Korea,
which endured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan.
</P>
<P>
While President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea sent his condolences,
a government party statement added, ``We reserve further comment,
considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan
relationship.''
China extended condolences and Taiwan said it will send a
delegation to the funeral.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan's daily United Evening News said:
``It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the United
States and Europe for the war, he did not direct a single word to
China to show his sorrow.''
Most historians believe Hirohito was a powerless figurehead but
had approved orders that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor and put
most of East Asia under an often brutal Japanese rule. Hirohito
called on his nation to surrender in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The emperor's death drew mixed reaction in the Netherlands, which
lost more than 20,000 people under Japan's wartime occupation of the
former Dutch East Indies.
</P>
<P>
The government said it sent its sympathy for ``the loss that has
befallen the Japanese people,'' without mentioning the name of
Hirohito, branded a war criminal by survivors of the wartime
occupation of the colony that became Indonesia in 1949.
``To many war victims, only now has World War II finally come to
an end,'' said Gen. Ruud Boekholt, chairman of the August 15
Commemoration Foundation, a group representing 127,000 Dutch
citizens who underwent Japanese internment.
``Daily, they still feel the pain of the wartime suffering that
was inflicted on them in the name of Emperor Hirohito,'' Boekholt
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
But Indonesian President Suharto cabled his condolences to Crown
Prince Akihito, Hirohito's eldest son who immediately ascended the
Chrysanthemum Throne, and said he will personally pay the last
homage to Hirohito, presidential spokesman Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II expressed his condolences and sent telegrams to
Hirohito's family, Vatican radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II said she was saddened and Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said she shares the Japanese people's sorrow. But
opposition lawmakers said Britain should boycott his funeral.
``No one should go to that funeral from this country,'' said Ron
Brown, a lawmaker of the opposition Labor Party, who denounced
Hirohito as ``a war criminal of the worst kind.''
``It would be a grave insult to the many men and women ...
imprisoned in slave camps,'' he said. ``Many of them died, but those
who survived still suffer today.''
King Juan Carlos of Spain, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and other
Persian Gulf monarchs, King Birendra of Nepal and Sultan Mahmood
Iskandar of Malaysia also sent condolences to Akihito.
</P>
<P>
Brazil called Hirohito ``a superior symbol of the Japanese
nation, its culture and its anxieties in a period of drastic
transformations in the world and his country and in a time of grave
new challenges in the world.''

BBC Show Says U.S. Helped Spare Hirohito From War Crimes Trial

U.S. prosecutors pressured Japan's wartime prime
minister, Gen. Hideki Tojo, into changing testimony at his trial to
avoid incriminating Emperor Hirohito in war crimes, a television
documentary claims.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corp. documentary, details of which were
released Wednesday by its maker Edward Behr, said the U.S.
prosecutors worked with the emperor's aides to find a way to avoid
putting Hirohito on trial.
</P>
<P>
The documentary challenges Hirohito's image as a peaceful man
forced to go along with his generals' plans and alleges among other
things that he:
_Must have known about the massacre of at least 20,000 Chinese at
Nanking in 1937 because he received regular detailed reports from
the China front.
_Knew more than a month in advance of Japanese plans to attack
the U.S. navy at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
</P>
<P>
The BBC will show ``Hirohito _ Behind the Myth'' on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
Behr is a Paris-based journalist. His biography of China's last
monarch was used for the award-winning film ``The Last Emperor.''
It has been reported previously that American prosecutors wanted
to keep Hirohito out of the war crimes trial and asked Tojo to
suggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on the
advice of the High Command.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces occupying
Japan, wrote in his book ``Reminiscences'' that he fended off
pressure from Britain and the Soviet Union to indict Hirohito,
arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
Behr told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday
that the documentary will be shown in the United States by PBS on
March 13.
</P>
<P>
The BBC has also sold it to Australia, Austria, Canada, Hong
Kong, Israel, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Hirohito died Saturday at the age of 87.
</P>
<P>
The documentary says the decision not to prosecute Hirohito came
from President Harry S. Truman and that Tojo's evidence was altered
so the emperor would not be incriminated.

<P>
To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor
Hirohito, but in Japan his given name was seldom used. In Japanese
he was simply called Tenno Heika, meaning His Majesty The Emperor.
</P>
<P>
The foreign habit of using his name rankled some Japanese, who
found it impolite, and unnecessary since to them there is only one
emperor. Some Japanese complained that after his death it even
became inaccurate to call him Hirohito because he has been given the
posthumous name Showa.
</P>
<P>
In Japanese histories, he will be recorded as Emperor Showa, the
name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 1926. It
means Enlightened Peace, and has been succeeded by Heisei, or
Achieving Peace, the name the government chose for the reign of
Hirohito's son Akihito a few hours after the emperor died Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
But for the convenience of the rest of the world, which is not so
able to keep track of the person behind the changed name, even
official agencies have used the name Hirohito in English-language
publications.
</P>
<P>
The obituary issued in English by the Foreign Press Center, which
is supported by the Foreign Ministry, was headed ``His late Majesty
The Emperor Hirohito.''
English-language newspapers published in Japan quickly began
using the name Showa for Hirohito after his death, but it did not
become truly official until Jan. 31, when Emperor Akihito conducted
a ceremony in which Showa became the late emperor's posthumous name.
</P>
<P>
A stone tablet placed in his tomb is engraved only with the
posthumous name and the dates of his death and burial.
</P>
<P>
The custom of renaming emperors after the completion of their
reigns began after the death in 1912 of Emperor Meiji, Hirohito's
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, years are numbered according to the emperor's tenure on
the throne. Thus 1926 became Showa 1 as Crown Prince Hirohito
ascended to the throne on Dec. 25 when his father, Emperor Taisho,
died. The year 1927 was Showa 2, and 1989 was Showa 64 until
Hirohito's death on Jan. 7. Now this year is Heisei 1.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese custom of changing imperial names is not unique
among world royalty, where an individual may have a variety of names
and titles in a royal career. In Britain, Prince Andrew became the
Duke of York upon his marriage in 1986.

Hirohito Leaves $13 Million in Taxable Property

<P>
Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable
property, a tax office near the Imperial Palace announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the
amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official in the Kojimachi

Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87. He was succeeded by
Akihito, his eldest son. Hirohito's wife, Nagako, became empress
dowager.
</P>
<P>
Akihito has paid $2.99 million in inheritance taxes on his half
of his father's estate, which he divided evenly with his mother. The
empress dowager, as Hirohito's spouse, was exempt from paying
inheritance taxes, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese constitution, drafted by U.S. occupation forces
shortly after the end of World War II in 1945, stipulates the
emperor is the ``symbol of the state and the unity of the people.''
Hirohito's estate included stocks and other personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
Three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and jewels _ which were
transferred from emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were about
3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that were donated to the state,
the tax office official said.

DEATH OF HIROHITO

<TEXT>
<P>
The death of Emperor Hirohito finished the list of political and military 
leaders of the World War II era, one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of 
history on either the European or Asian continents. 
</P>
<P>
The political and military role that Emperor Hirohito played before and during 
the war was never clear to us. He may not have had that kind of influence now, 
but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with 
religious vigor. At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito 
was spared punishment because "it was his ambitious military generals who made 
the decision to invade the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
I found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his 
position, in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do 
with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some Japanese military leaders were executed after the war for 
criminal acts they were responsible for. I often wonder if Hirohito ever felt 
grateful to those generals who were sacrificed, in part, so that he could live 
for another 43 years. I only wish that the soul of Emperor Hirohito be ready to 
face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of 
innocent men, women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name 
during the war.
