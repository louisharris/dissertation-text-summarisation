Australian Novelist Wins Booker Prize
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australian novelist Peter Carey was awarded the
coveted Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday night for his love story,
``Oscar and Lucinda.''
A panel of five judges unanimously announced the award of the
$26,250 prize after an 80-minute deliberation during a banquet at
London's ancient Guildhall.
</P>
<P>
The judges made their selection from 102 books published in
Britain in the past 12 months and which they read in their homes.
</P>
<P>
Carey, who lives in Sydney with his wife and son, said in a brief
speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to
attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won.
``If I'd known I was going to win I think I would have taken a
bit more trouble with my handwriting,'' he said as he stared down at
his notes.
</P>
<P>
He was unsuccessful in the prize competition in 1985 when his
novel, ``Illywhacker,'' was among the final six.
</P>
<P>
Carey called the award a ``great honor'' and he thanked the prize
sponsors for ``provoking so much passionate discussion about
literature _ perhaps there will be more tomorrow.''
``Everyone who loves good books benefits from this, surely,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
The winning novel is a fitting choice for Australia's
bicentennial year.
</P>
<P>
It tells of a romance between an English gambler and an
Australian heiress who meet on a steamship's maiden voyage to
Australia in the mid-19th century. The story weaves in Australian
history from its founding in 1788 by British immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Panel chairman Michael Foot, a writer and former leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said the judges agreed that entries this
year had been ``exceptionally strong'' and that choosing the last
six novels was extremely difficult.
``We hope there will be no criticisms but if there are, then
people should start reading the books for themselves,'' Foot said.
</P>
<P>
Carey was the only non-Briton in the final six. The son of an
auto dealer, he was born in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, and attended
Geelong Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne, where the
Prince of Wales was also a pupil as an 18-year-old in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Carey was an advertising copywriter before turning to writing
books in 1965.
</P>
<P>
The first Booker Prize was awarded in 1969. It is administered by
Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books, and is sponsored
by Booker, an international food and farming business.

Bookmakers Pick Japanese Author to Win Booker Prize
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six novels have been nominated for the Booker
Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say
the favorite is ``The Remains of the Day'' by Japanese author Kazuo
Ishiguro.
</P>
<P>
The award, to be announced Oct. 26, carries a $31,600 prize
funded by the Booker McConnell food company.
</P>
<P>
Oddsmaker William Hill gave 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about
a butler's travels through Britain's West Country and said it was
``a firm favorite'' to win.
</P>
<P>
Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the
Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger
this time in our view,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
The other books nominated are:
_ ``Cat's Eye,'' a story of painter Elaine Risley and her return
to her childhood home in Toronto by Canadian author Margaret Atwood,
also a previous nominee.
_ ``The Book of Evidence,'' a prison story of kidnap and murder
convict Freddie Montgomery by John Banville, literary editor of The
Irish Times newspaper.
_ ``Jigsaw,'' by Sybille Bedford, an autobiographical novel about
an adolescent's travels through Germany, Italy and France.
_ ``A Disaffection,'' Scottish novelist James Kelman's story
about a school teacher, Patrick Doyle, whose professional
frustrations are fueled by a drinking problem and unrequited love
for a colleague.
_ ``Restoration,'' British author Rose Tremain's story of Robert
Merivel, a favorite of King Charles II who married the monarch's
youngest mistress.
``We expect more interest in this year's Booker Prize than ever
before, partly thanks to last year's controversy over Salman
Rushdie's `Satanic Verses,''' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie was nominated for the prize last year but it was won by
Australian author Peter Carey for his love story ``Oscar and
Lucinda.''
Rushdie, a British citizen, has been in hiding since Feb. 14 when
the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered he be
killed for allegedly blaspheming Islam in ``Satanic Verses.''
This year's six nominees were chosen Thursday from 102 books
considered by a panel headed by David Lodge, a British literary
critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for
his book, ``Nice Work.''

Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker
Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel ``The Remains of
the Day,'' judges announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prize is worth $32,000.
</P>
<P>
Judges praised the novel, a love story about a butler's English
vacation, as ``a cunningly structured and beautifully paced
performance.''
Other finalists this year were Canadian Margaret Atwood for
``Cat's Eye,'' Irish author John Banville for ``Book of Evidence,''
Scotland's James Kelman for ``A Disaffection'' and English writers
Sybille Bedford for ``Jigsaw'' and Rose Tremain for ``Restoration.''
After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman
Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in
February when he was threatened with death by Moslems who said his
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed their faith.
``Now that circumstances have changed, when perhaps it is
inconvenient for many people to support his writing, I just felt it
was fitting that we should not turn our backs on him,'' Ishiguro
said.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie lives in England. Ishiguro, 39, arrived in England at
age 6 and now lives in south London. He writes in English.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the winner, the judges said: ```The Remains of the
Day' renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and
explores the large, vexed themes of class, tradition and duty. It
was narrowly preferred but universally admired.''
Ishiguro was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his
novel ``An Artist of the Floating World.''
The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food
and agriculture business.

The Booker - Britain's Favorite Literary Prize
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Booker Prize is Britain's literary event of
the year, guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen novel after the
award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in London's ancient
Guildhall.
</P>
<P>
The prize to the author is a check for 20,000 pounds (nearly
$38,000), sponsored by Booker, an international food and
agriculture business.
``British publishers are very secretive about their sales but we
know that when Thomas Keneally won it in 1982 for `Schindler's
Ark,' his publishers, who had printed 15,000 copies, sold 75,000
over the next 23 weeks,'' said Christine Shaw of Book Trust.
</P>
<P>
The trust is a charity promoting reading and books and
administers the prize.
``The prize has become internationally known, and the worldwide
demand for the winning book, in English and translations, is
spectacular,'' said Shaw.
</P>
<P>
The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker
and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant
literary award to encourage and reward good writing.
</P>
<P>
British publishers can submit three new novels by British and
Commonwealth writers. There were 110 submissions last year.
</P>
<P>
A management committee of authors, booksellers, librarians and
the sponsors chooses a jury of five: a writer or two, an academic,
a politician interested in literature and a literary editor or
critic.
</P>
<P>
Each juror reads every book submitted, lists about six favorites
and meets the other jurors to select and announce six finalists.
</P>
<P>
As public debate rages over who's in, who's out and who might
win, with bookmakers across the country calling the odds, the
jurors meet again and finally select the winner on the afternoon of
announcement day.
</P>
<P>
This year's finalists: Beryl Bainbridge ``An Awfully Big
Adventure,'' A.S. Byatt ``Possession,'' Penelope Fitzgerald ``The
Gate of Angels,'' John McGahern ``Amongst Women,'' Brian Moore
``Lies of Silence'' and Mordecai Richler ``Solomon Gursky Was
Here.''

A.S. Byatt Wins Britain's Top Literary Prize
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Critic and novelist A.S. Byatt on Tuesday won the
Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award, for her
tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of
imaginary Victorian poets.
</P>
<P>
The five judges deliberated two hours before awarding the
$39,000 prize to Antonia Byatt for ``Possession,'' one of six
finalists in the 21-year-old competition.
</P>
<P>
Last year's Booker winner was Kazuo Ishiguro for his novel,
``The Remains of the Day.''
Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judge's
panel, announced the prize at a banquet in London's Elizabethan
Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor.
``There was very strong individual support for several books on
the short list and finally `Possession' by A.S. Byatt was the
winner by a majority vote,'' said the judges.
``The panel was unanimous, however, in agreeing that the
standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this
made their decision unusually interesting and unusually
difficult.''
Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish
Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work,
has published five novels since 1964.
</P>
<P>
In ``Possession,'' she tells how two graduate students piece
together the relationship and lives of two imaginary Victorian
poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets'
journeys across England and to France. The influence of the past on
the living is a theme throughout the book.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Byatt, born in 1936, is the daughter of a lawyer and sister
of novelist Margaret Drabble.
</P>
<P>
Her first novel, ``Shadow of a Sun,'' concerned the efforts of a
woman to escape the shadow of her novelist father. A 1978 work,
``The Virgin in the Garden,'' makes allegorical allusions to
Shakespeare and other English literary geniuses in a tale of a play
performed at a country house.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Byatt taught English and American literature at University
College in London until 1983, when she quit to write fulltime.
</P>
<P>
Other finalists this year were 1979 Booker Prize winner Penelope
Fitzgerald with ``The Gate of Angels,'' Irish novelist John
McGahern's ``Amongst Women,'' Canadian-born Mordecai Richler's
``Solomon Gursky Was Here,'' Brian Moore's ``Lies of Silence,'' and
Beryl Bainbridge's ``An Awfully Big Adventure.'' They were chosen
from a list of 113 books published in the United Kingdom in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food
and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust. It is
Britain's top literary award.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Arts: Booker Prize shortlist
</HL>

<TEXT>
<P>
THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judges for
this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British (and Commonwealth) fiction
announced the shortlist.
</P>
<P>
The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no
longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and
sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to
public attention.
</P>
<P>
Its critics say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the annual fiction
industry and the intense media hype of the shortlisted authors does a
disservice to the hordes of other gifted but unlisted writers.
</P>
<P>
This year's shortlist contains no surprises. London's litterati have for
weeks been betting on Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient - those of them
who have seen a proof copy because it is not officially published until next
week. Last night the bookmakers William Hill made it the 5-2 favourite.
</P>
<P>
The shortlist is:
Serenity House by Christopher Hope (MacMillan Pounds 14.99). Black comedy by
a master South Africa-born specialist in the trade. Set in a Highgate
'eventide refuge' where euthanasia is an unspoken word and its senior
citizen, Max Montfalcon, turns out to be a geriatric Nazi scientist. The FT
review next Saturday will describe it as 'surreal farce .. scabrously
enjoyable ..'
The Butcher's Boy by Patrick McCabe (Picador Pounds 14.99). An Irish
murderer, a soft-in-the-head orphan jailed for life, recalls his life in
grisly detail. The FT reviewer said that 'the misery and deprivation of
working class life have never been so brutally evoked ..'
Black Dogs by Ian McEwan (Secker 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Warburg Pounds 14.99). McEwan's fiction
is uniquely disturbing - some would say deliberately offensive. He is the
novelist of misanthropy. This is the tale of a failed marriage, episodically
told, and the black dogs of evil are both metaphorical and literal.
</P>
<P>
The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje (Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99). The Sri
Lankan poet and novelist Ondaatje, who lives in Canada, has followed 'in the
skin of a lion' with an extraordinary book about four characters in a Tuscan
villa in the closing months of the last war. The central metaphor is bombs -
disposal of, and then Hiroshima. The 'English patient' is a central mystery
around which the others' stories orbit: he fell out of the sky in flames;
who is he? The FT review on Saturday will hail it as a masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
Daughters of the House by Michele Roberts (Virago Pounds 14.99). The
surprise contender because it is not yet published. Roberts comes from an
Anglo-French Catholic background and this informs her new novel with a
strong rural-Normandy atmosphere. Two cousins, one pious, one worldly.
</P>
<P>
Shades of Saint Therese of Lisieux. Lots of action in the kitchen; something
is hidden in the cellar.
</P>
<P>
Sacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth (Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99). Unsworth's
massive novel about the 1750s slave trade came out early this year to
widespread critical praise. The shipboard detail - the horrors of the trade
-are brilliantly done. The judges will have to rule on the characterisation
of the European protagonists who go off to found a Utopia in Florida.
</P>
<P>
The judges this year, who will include Independent journalist Mark Lawson
and John Coldstream, literary editor of The Daily Telegraph, will be chaired
by the biographer Victoria Glendinning.
</P>
<P>
The winner will be named at a Guildhall dinner on Tuesday October 13.
</P>
<P>
Last year the prize was won by Ben Okri, for his book The Famished Road.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Arts: Literature turns over an old leaf - Jackie
Wullschlager looks at changing attitudes to the novel
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a sensational shortlist: a bestseller about love and hypnotism, a
blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania, and a pornographic
shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure
Newcastle publisher would risk printing it. Out are the eminences gris of
Victorian letters - novels by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advised
Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make the grade.
</P>
<P>
This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be
announced by six judges, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and
broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. They have avoided dull and worthy classics and
chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling
today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda,
George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the
Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide. The winner will be revealed
on October 15 (four days after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the
Cheltenham Festival of Literature.
</P>
<P>
Like today's Booker Prize, it is a publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is
backing the spoof award, is a significant publisher of classic Victorian
novels. But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in
historical reconstruction. It raises questions about how the relationship
between literature and society has changed in the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
First, the similarities. A good yarn is a good yarn. Of the 1894 books,
Trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when
mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croaks like a crow when
he dies during one of her concerts. The Prisoner of Zenda tells of an
Englishman impersonating the King of Ruritania and rescuing him from demons.
</P>
<P>
On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy
and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels
re-enacts the wolf-child legend. All the books on both lists are gripping
stories.
</P>
<P>
The lists share key themes. Both, for instance, have books about colonial
exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise,
which is set in the First World War in German East Africa. Both provoke in
similar ways.
</P>
<P>
The controversial books of 1894 were Trilby, with its louche vie boheme
milieu, and Esther Waters, in which a 17-year-old girl is seduced,
impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a
fiver. It is now seen as Moore's best work, but in 1894 it had problems
finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take
it.
</P>
<P>
A century on, the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remains
vexed. Last week, a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan
Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love, The Folding Star, on the
Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics.
</P>
<P>
But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker, his novel will not become the
succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling
novel of the 19th century. For the great difference between then and now is
that in 1894 a Booker Prize was not needed to sell fiction.
</P>
<P>
Today, we accept the gap between literary writing, such as Hollinghurst's,
and popular bestsellers by writers like Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland.
</P>
<P>
This is the gap the Booker tries to bridge by giving high-level publicity to
works which would not normally reach a mass audience. The trick works - last
year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback
copies. Before the short-list was announced it sold 10,600.
</P>
<P>
The Victorians, in contrast, were lovers of contemporary fiction. Novels
accounted for 20 per cent of published books, and no distinction was made
between high and low art. In the mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds
12,000 for Little Dorrit, the equivalent of nearly Pounds 400,000 today.
</P>
<P>
Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK was half that of today
and the literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold
400,000 copies. All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were
also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100
years later.
</P>
<P>
Why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894? Social, cultural
and psychological reasons play a part. Socially, the 1890s reading public
was a vastly more homogenous group than today: a small number of middle
class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be
literate was to belong to an elite. The idea of a two-tier, up and
down-market, fiction was irrelevant. Culturally, these writers and readers
were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel was their
political and intellectual forum.
</P>
<P>
Today we no longer share the Victorian confidence in the novel as a key
genre of our age. Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by
Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the
divergence between highbrow and lowbrow. The dominance of film and
television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer
attract the most creative talents. George du Maurier originally offered the
outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he thought would write a better novel.
</P>
<P>
Today du Maurier would have sold it to Hollywood or the BBC.
</P>
<P>
The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if
we know them, was answered in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th
century we have TV soaps. Just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters
from EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop was running as a
serial there was widespread press speculation on whether Little Nell would
die, and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved. Sentimentality,
accessibility, topicality - what characterises today's soaps were clear
features of the novel in 1894. Both In the Year of Jubilee and Esther
Waters, for example, centre on the burning 1890s debate about marriage,
feminism and the 'New Woman', yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
The 1894 books are compelling because they prefigure our own times and yet
are set back from them. Trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a
decade away from Freud; The Ebb Tide paved the way for Conrad's Heart of
Darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression.
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that the 1994 Booker choices will speak as eloquently of new
trends today. Whereas the 1894 titles had contemporary settings, many of the
1994 books are historical (such as Paradise) or are driven by nostalgia
(such as Beside the Ocean of Time). Which book will win on October 15?
</P>
<P>
Stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in 1894 in Samoa, the
setting of The Ebb Tide. Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote,
because it is the best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones in
the lost paradise of Mowgli's jungle; its position on the list may also
rescue it from schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it as a serious
novel about a young man's self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
My vote goes to Trilby. Soft-focus, ideologically shaky - in its
anti-Semitic portrait of Svengali - and sometimes sloppy, it is a story of
demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after
better-written works have faded from memory. Like Rebecca, the popular novel
by du Maurier's granddaughter, it is a natural equivalent of what the
current Booker Prize seeks to create: a combination of the classic and the
bestseller.

FT  06 SEP 94 / Booker shortlist fields a 'B-team'
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction,
announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who?' from many in
the publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
According to one insider, some on the list 'are B-team writers at best'.
</P>
<P>
The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto
and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as
a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by
young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late
(Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was
almost universally well-reviewed.
</P>
<P>
As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical
fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by
Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John
Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they
don't make the grade'.
</P>
<P>
The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of
the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new
fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for
consideration for the award. Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems an
astonishing omission, as do new novels by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia
McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace.
</P>
<P>
But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be
disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife
as ever.
</P>
<P>
One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was
Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before
it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief
literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.
</P>
<P>
Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former
Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's
failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud.

But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the
award according to some critics. 'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must
have dealt a final death blow to the Booker.' The winner, selected from an
original 130, will be announced on October 11.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Judges split as Kelman wins Booker
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as 'mad' by
one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr
James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg.
</P>
<P>
The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian
dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have
damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and -
worst of all - unsaleable.
</P>
<P>
Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledged that Mr
Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible. 'We had an
extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided,' he said after
three hours of debate.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, said she was
made extremely cross by the decision. 'It's just a drunken Scotsman railing
against bureaucracy,' she said. 'My eyes are stretched in disbelief. The
voting system is completely mad. Kelman was the least favourite of the three
front runners. If it had been a short story it would have been fine.'
Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observers, the most difficult work to
have won the prize. In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceived by some
as a Scottish isolationist, anticipated the criticism, by declaring: 'My
culture and my language have the right to exist.'
One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman
Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked:
'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is.'
The Booker prize has, in its 26-year history, always provoked controversy.
</P>
<P>
But this year's rows have been of a particularly fine vintage.
</P>
<P>
Prof Bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary
fiction. Another judge, Mr James Wood, literary critic of The Guardian, was
attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for
the award, Ms Claire Messud, was in fact Mrs James Wood.
</P>
<P>
Most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers, who dismissed the
shortlist as narcoleptic. The other contenders were The Folding Star by Alan
Hollinghurst, Beside the Ocean of Time by George Mackay Brown, Paradise by
Abdulrazak Gurnah, Reef by Romesh Gunesekera and Knowledge of Angels by Jill
Paton Walsh.
</P>
<P>
In spite of heavy publicity, the novels nominated have been selling 50 per
cent less than last year's shortlist. Last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's
Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, sold 350,000 copies. 'Kelman's novel is unlikely to
come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said.
</P>
<P>
Mr Kelman was also shortlisted for the prize in 1989 for his novel A
Disaffection.

<P>
On the day of the Big Event, Ladbroke, the large British betting agency, posted the final odds. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Moore was the favorite at 7-4, followed by Peter Ackroyd (5-2), Iris Murdoch (3-1) and Chinua Achebe (9-2). 
</P>
<P>
The two dark horses, Nina Bawden and Penelope Lively, were each tipped at 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
You may have noticed a distinctly literary tilt to that lineup, an affinity with the bookshelf, not the bookie. 
</P>
<P>
All of those people published new works of fiction here in Britain during the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
And for the last few weeks, literary punters throughout the British Isles have been placing bets on which of those writers would win the Booker Prize, the best-known, best-liked and, almost incidentally, most prestigious fiction award in the land. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks the Booker contenders have received almost as much press coverage as the Charles and Di rift. 
</P>
<P>
And nearly every article, from book reviews to author interviews, has featured the latest odds. 
</P>
<P>
The betting is done largely by literary insiders, says Graham Sharpe, who sets the Booker odds at William Hill, Britain's other big betting agency. 
</P>
<P>
"They read the books, hear the gossip and want to pull off a little coup for themselves," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's winner, "The Old Devils" by Kingsley Amis, was a 5-2 favorite, but this year, anyone who chose the victor made some dough. 
</P>
<P>
"When she accepted her prize for "Moon Tiger," Penelope Lively looked surprised and pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a betting woman, and I have slight reservations about books becoming a spectator sport," she said in soft Oxbridge tones. 
</P>
<P>
"But those who are in the know tell me that 7-1 was an irresistible flutter." 
Her 65-year-old mother was among those who made a killing. 
</P>
<P>
America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards, but in terms of excitement, hoopla and man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound ($26,000) Booker Prize. 
</P>
<P>
With the possible exception of France's respected Prix Goncourt, there's nothing quite like it anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Britons wryly compare the Booker to the Academy Awards, and though there's just one prize and no envelope, similarities exist. 
</P>
<P>
There's a team of judges and a pool of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
This year each British publisher could submit three new titles, for a grand total of 93. 
</P>
<P>
As one judge noted wearily, "By August, I was in more than a slight panic, sometimes reading all day and evening; reading while standing at the bus stop, reading while cooking, reading, almost, while talking on the telephone." 
Next comes the "short-list," the judges' top six, which was announced with great fanfare in late September. 
</P>
<P>
This year the works included Brian Moore's political thriller "The Color of Blood" (E.P. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton, 182 pages, $16.95); Peter Ackroyd's "Chatterton" (Grove Press, 240 pages, $17.95); Nina Bawden's "Circles of Deceit" (St. Martin's Press, 208 pages, $14.95); Iris Murdoch's 23rd novel "The Book and the Brotherhood" (Viking, 608 pages, $19.95); Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe's "Anthills of the Savannah" (Doubleday, 240 pages, $16.95); and "Moon Tiger" (Grove Press, 216 pages, $15.95). 
</P>
<P>
The awards presentation came on the last Thursday in October, and like any major awards presentation, it came complete with limousines, banquet (salmon mousse, champagne sorbet and English roast beef) and television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
The suspense was genuine; the judges chose the winner just three hours before the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the ratings for the prime-time broadcast didn't upstage those of "Eastenders," Britain's popular soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
Yet interest was sufficient for Andre Deutsch, "Moon Tiger's" British publisher, to order up an additional 20,000 copies almost the minute Mrs. Lively - and the nation - heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
By British standards, sales figures for recent Booker winners are stunning, from "The Old Devils" (80,000 hard-cover copies) to Anita Brookner's "Hotel du Lac" (40,000 copies). 
</P>
<P>
Even Keri Hulme's "The Bone People," a look at Maori culture that most readers found impenetrable, reached a respectable 21,000 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Short-listed authors are just a few paces behind, sharing the best-seller list with Dick Francis and Scott Turow. 
</P>
<P>
Heinemann initially printed 3,000 copies of "Anthills of the Savannah," the usual run for contemporary literary fiction. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 10,000 copies have sold. 
</P>
<P>
"Being short-listed probably changed the destiny of that book," declares a member of the Heinemann sales staff. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there's currently talk of initiating a similar prize with a similar purse for the year's best biography. 
</P>
<P>
Another notable spinoff is the Booker harpies, readers intent on digesting all six titles, then vigorously disputing the choices, which never please everyone. 
</P>
<P>
This year the Sunday Times offered readers a complete autographed collection of the six books for the equivalent of $112, perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always this way, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Headlines were modest back in 1969 when P.H. Newby won the first ever Booker Prize for "Something to Answer For." (The wonderfully appropriate name comes from Booker-McConnell PLC, the international food and agriculture conglomerate that puts up the prize money each year.) 
The idea was to devise a British equivalent to the Prix Goncourt, and like that august French award, the Booker attracted attention the minute it kicked up controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The early fuss was kept within the literary world, with critics sniping over choices and the prize's varied ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
The real world took notice in 1974, when Elizabeth Jane Howard, one of the three judges, wrote a letter to the Times claiming that in her opinion Kingsley Amis's "Ending Up," one of the short-listed books, was his best ever. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, she was married to Mr. Amis at the time. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
But many credit the Booker's current appeal to the 1982 competition and Thomas Keneally's "Schindler's Ark," or "Schindler's List" as it is known in the U.S. Written as a novel, the book told the true story of a remarkable German who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews in concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
But even after it won the Booker, people argued that it wasn't a novel. 
</P>
<P>
"The more people questioned it, the more it sold," says Ion Trewin, editorial director at Hodder 
</P>
<P>
amp;
</P>
<P>
Stoughton. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first year the prize caught the media and public imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly the Booker gained inches on front pages." 
Oh yes, "Moon Tigers" is a dying woman's recollection of her life as a World War II war correspondent and her affair with a young tank officer.
