Within hours of the schoolyard shootings
that left five children and the gunman dead and 30 wounded Tuesday,
dozens of translators rushed to assist the many Southeast Asian
parents who arrived at the hospital desperate for word of their
youngsters.
``I would imagine it is absolute panic. They are not sure what
happened, not sure what's going on around them,'' said Laura Dixon,
of the Charterhouse Center refugee program, in Stockton, describing
the scene translators found when they arrived at San Joaquin County
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Many of the parents speak no English and were unable to ask
whether their children were among those killed or wounded when a
heavily armed gunman in combat fatigues invaded Cleveland Elementary
School and opened fire before taking his own life.
``They do have people on staff at the hospital, but they are so
overloaded they need every extra person they can secure,'' said
Dixon, whose organization began calling throughout Stockton for
volunteers speaking Southeast Asian languages. About a dozen
translators were sent to the county hospital, after officials there
called for help.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, thousands of Southeast Asians have settled in
Stockton, drawn in part by the farming and fishing that flourish in
the area. School officials said 60 percent of the children were
Southeast Asian refugees _ either from Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.
</P>
<P>
All five of the children killed were of this background,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
A Stockton woman who runs an after-school program teaching
English to Cambodian refugees dispatched 25 translators, including
volunteers from all over the city, to the school and the hospital,
Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin County Mental Health Department told Dixon a
grief center might be established at Charterhouse to help survivors,
whose recovery will be complicated by the language barrier.
</P>
<P>
Charterhouse is funded by the Episcopal Church and private
donations.

A man fired several dozen shots from an
automatic rifle in an elementary school Tuesday, killing six
children, wounding at least 35 other people and then shooting
himself in the head, authorities said.
``We have at least one suspect in custody who has a gunshot wound
to the head,'' Deputy Police Chief Ralph Tribble said.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Fernandez, spokesman for the county office of emergency
services, said six people had died.
</P>
<P>
Ellen Rich at St. Joseph's Medical Center said eight victims were
being treated there, and said the total, including those being
treated at other hospitals, was 35 wounded.
``We have at least 30 people that we've sent out to area
hospitals,'' said Police Chief Jack Calkins.
</P>
<P>
The attack at Cleveland Elementary School came shortly before
noon. Other children were kept in their rooms, said John Klose,
Stockton Unified School District information officer.
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. James Monk said his office learned that a ``man went
berserk with an automatic weapon and we have several (people) down.''
``Several dozen shots were heard from an automatic rifle,'' said
Monk.

The 26-year-old drifter with a long criminal
record who launched a mute, murderous assault on a California
elementary school Tuesday was described by his aunt as a loner and
childhood alcoholic, police said.
</P>
<P>
Patrick E. Purdy purchased an AK-47 rifle in this Portland suburb
several months ago, then returned to his hometown of Stockton,
Calif., where he used the gun to kill five children and wound 29
others, along with a teacher, at Cleveland Elementary School before
taking his own life, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Purdy, who went by the alias of Patrick West, had lived with an
aunt and uncle in Sandy from the first of July until late October,
said Sandy Police Chief Fred Punzel. He later moved to Lodi, Calif.,
where he listed his mailing address under the name of his
grandmother, Julia Chumbley, although he did not live with her,
authorities said.
``I'm shocked. It's just horrible. I don't understand why and I
probably won't ever know why,'' said Ms. Chumbley, a 63-year-old
retired cannery worker.
``It troubles me to think that such a terrible thing can happen.
</P>
<P>
It's like a nightmare. This sort of thing happens to others, not
you. Your own grandson.''
Stockton is about 15 miles southwest of Lodi.
</P>
<P>
Punzel said Purdy's aunt, Julie Michael, ``told me he was a loner
and as a child he was an alcoholic.''
Mrs. Michael said through a closed front door at her residence
that she was too upset to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Her next-door neighbor, Pat Thomas, 45, said she met West when he
lived with his relatives last summer.
``He seemed like a real nice young man,'' she said. ``He was here
looking for work.''
However, Purdy had an ``extensive criminal history,'' mostly in
the Los Angeles area, said Lucian Neely, deputy police chief in
Stockton, an agricultural city 60 miles east of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Purdy had no criminal record in Sandy, Clackamas County or
Portland, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Neely said Purdy originally was from Stockton and that he had
purchased the gun at the Sandy Trading Post Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
Punzel said Mrs. Michael told him Purdy left Oregon for a job as
a boilermaker in Texas. That job fell through and he went to
Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
The aunt and uncle last heard from Purdy at Thanksgiving, when he
was in Connecticut, Punzel said.
</P>
<P>
His mother lives in Sacramento, Calif., and his father was killed
in 1980 or 1981 when he was struck by a car as a pedestrian, Punzel
said.
</P>
<P>
State Division of Motor Vehicles records identify Purdy as
5-foot-11, 150 pounds, with blue eyes and blond hair, said spokesman
Dave Davis.

Neighborhood in Shock at School's `Killing Field'
</HL>

<DATELINE>STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children whose families escaped the
horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a
killing field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and
a pistol bearing the word ``victory.''
After the massacre at recess, the bodies of three Southeast Asian
children were outlined in blue on the playground of Cleveland
Elementary School where they died. Two others had been dragged by
teachers inside to a classroom, but also died. Twenty-nine other
pupils were wounded, along with a teacher.
``There was shooting all over. ... I was scared,'' said
sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the
final days of war and had never before heard gunfire. ``Everybody
was crying in my class.''
Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26,
armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the
school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds
before he shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on the
ground near a pool of blood and the gunman's body. The word
``victory'' was written on the pistol handle.
</P>
<P>
Binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began
outside the wood-and-stucco school building. Her teacher told
students to get under their desks.
</P>
<P>
The gunfire startled Michael Cuevas, whose first thought was that
the University of the Pacific fraternities near his house were
firing their miniature cannon again.
</P>
<P>
But the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon, and the scream
of sirens that followed told him this time was no prank.
``I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in
Stockton,'' said Cuevas, a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port of
Stockton who lives down the street from the elementary school.
``It's always in some other town, some other place. It's a shock
to my senses. I don't think it's even hit me as hard as it's going
to. You don't know whether to be excited, or confused or what.''
Police cars and news reporters crowded the street, which
typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their
children.
``Why here?'' said Jeff Russell, 37, who was born and reared in
the neighborhood. ``This has always been a sleepy little town. (The
shooting) put us back on the map.''
Lutheran and Baptist churches border the school in a neighborhood
of ranch-style homes, postage-stamp lawns and streets lined with
sycamore and oak trees in this agricultural city of 150,000 people
60 miles southeast of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old neighborhood near the University of the Pacific
is still home to many retired couples who raised their familes
there. But the city has been changing with the influx of Southeast
Asian refugees.
</P>
<P>
When school officials called clergy to console grieving families,
Buddhist priests in sandals and saffron robes arrived along with
their white-collared Christian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of Cleveland Elementary's students are of
Southeast Asian descent, said John Klose, spokesman for the Stockton
School District. The five children who were killed were Vietnamese
and Cambodian.
``This is one of our best neighborhood schools,'' Klose said.
``Of all of our schools that I would think of something like this
happening, this would be the last one I would think of.''
Across the street, Sarah Abbott stood astride her bicycle and
gazed at the school where she graduated ``many years ago.'' The
professional nanny said she was at the house of her 97-year-old
grandfather about a block from the school when the gunman set his
car on fire before starting to shoot.
``When the car exploded, my grandpa's house just shook,'' Abbott
said. ``It scared me. ... It was just too close.''

A South Carolina school where a gunman
killed two 8-year-old girls Sept. 26 will send cards and offer words
of encouragement to a California school that lost five pupils in a
shooting rampage.
``We will tell them they can survive this,'' said Kat Finkbeiner,
a physical education teacher whose jaw was shattered in the shooting
spree last year at Greenwood's Oakland Elementary School. ``I would
tell them, `Lean on your community, share the sorrow.' We've lived
through this. I know we can help.''
On Sept. 26, a man with a history of mental problems opened fire
with a handgun at Oakland Elementary School, killing two youngsters
and wounding nine other people. Ms. Finkbeiner helped subdue the
gunman, Jamie Wilson, 19.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a 26-year-old drifter with a long crimnal record
opened fire with an assault rifle at Cleveland Elementary School in
Stockton, Calif., killing five children and wounding 30 other people
before taking his own life.
``It's unpleasant. It's unhappy, but they can live through it;
they can be happy another day,'' Ms. Finkbeiner said.
</P>
<P>
Children at the Greenwood school will be asked to send cards to
the California school, while the principal, Eleanor Rice, and Ms.
</P>
<P>
Finkbeiner said they will contact officials at the Stockton school
to offer encouragement.
``Our wounds have not closed. We are still hurting. It makes us
more compassionate for these people,'' the principal said.
</P>
<P>
Eveline Higginbotham, the third-grade teacher in whose classroom
the two little girls died, said the California tragedy ``just brings
it all back again.''
``I'm just in shock,'' she said.

Here is a profile of the gunman who took the lives of five
children at a Stockton, Calif., school Tuesday. It is based on
information from police and relatives, and on background reported by
the Sacramento Bee newspaper.
</P>
</TEXT>

Prayers, Counseling in Aftermath of School Shooting

<TEXT>
<P>
Grief-stricken family and friends mourned
the deaths of five school children gunned down during recess, while
the killer was buried nearly unnoticed in a nearby town.
</P>
<P>
Parents and teachers continued counseling the children who
witnessed Tuesday's schoolyard slayings, trying to help them deal
with the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Purdy, 24, opened fire outside the Cleveland Elementary
School with an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle, firing more than
100 rounds, killing five children and wounding 29 others and one
teacher.
</P>
<P>
Three days and nights of prayer began Thursday for two of the
youngsters killed, and services for the other children were being
held today and Monday. Gov. George Deukmejian was to attend Monday's
services.
</P>
<P>
Purdy was buried Friday in nearby Lodi, said his grandmother,
Julia Chumbley. He was interred following a service at Cherokee
Memorial Cemetery, which several of his relatives attended, she said.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the wounded students were still hospitalized, but
most were reported in improved conditions.
</P>
<P>
At Cleveland School, about three-quarters of the school's 970
pupils had returned to classes by Friday, about three times the
number who attended Wednesday, but it was anything but a routine
school day.
</P>
<P>
Counselors and school psychologists were assisting teachers in
classrooms, and some parents sat in with their children to comfort
and reassure them.
</P>
<P>
One mother, who asked not to be identified, told reporters that
her youngest son, a 7-year-old second grader who was on playground
when the shootings occurred, would only come back to school if she
stayed with him.
``They're making it back, slowly but surely,'' she said, adding
that she planned to spend Friday as she did Thursday, at her son's
side in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
Cleveland School is in the heart of California's third-largest
community of refugees from Southeast Asia, and nearly two-thirds of
the school's population is from Asia. All of the dead children were
from refugee families, as were 19 of the 29 wounded.
</P>
<P>
School authorities said they were particularly concerned that the
killing might not only revive the psychological trauma of the
horrors they experienced in Southeast Asia, but that those families
might flee from the area without accepting counseling if they feared
a racial motive in the attack.
``We want to pass the word to the community that this is not a
racist act ... It could happen to anybody, anywhere, anytime. This
is a crazy action from one individual. It is not racism,'' said An
Tran of the Southeast Asian Refugee Resettlement Program.
</P>
<P>
Stockton Police Capt. Dennis Perry also repeated that there was
no evidence that Purdy, who committed suicide after the attack, was
specifically targeting Asians.
``It wasn't any one race or group of people. He hated
everybody,'' Perry said of Purdy, who as a child 14 years earlier
had attended Cleveland School.

Grieving relatives and friends gathered
at memorial services Saturday to mourn the five school children
slain by a camouflage-garbed, suicidal drifter.
``Although there are some people in the United States who do bad
things, most of the people in the United States do good things,''
said Patricia Busher, principal of Cleveland Elementary School,
where the killings and the woundings of 29 students and one teacher
happened last Tuesday.
``The tragedy that occurred at our school could have happened
anywhere. There is no way to protect us from this kind of tragedy
... this senseless tragedy. In time, some of the cutting edge of the
pain will go away,'' Busher said.
</P>
<P>
Her speech, at a memorial service attended by 200 people for the
four Cambodian children killed, was translated as she spoke into the
Cambodian language.
``Tragedy has followed you,'' state Sen. John Garamendi told the
families, refugees from a country where more than 1 million people
were killed in executions and enforced hardship after a 1975
communist takeover.
</P>
<P>
The service, held in Central Methodist Church, was for 8-year-old
Oeun Lim, 9-year-old Rathanan Or, 8-year-old Ram Chun and 6-year-old
Sokhim An.
</P>
<P>
During the morning, a Catholic funeral mass and burial were held
for 6-year-old Thuy Tran, daughter of Vietnamese refugees.
</P>
<P>
Another memorial service for the four Cambodians was planned
Sunday at a mortuary.
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian planned to speak at a service Monday
morning for all five children at Stockton Civic Auditorium. People
attending that service were asked to follow a Southeast Asian
cultural tradition and wear black-and-white ribbons.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a gun on himself after firing
more than 100 rounds from an AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifle at
Cleveland Elementary, where he had attended grade school, was buried
Friday in an unmarked grave in a family plot at Lodi.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the wounded children and the wounded teacher remained
hospitalized Saturday. Three children were discharged Friday.
</P>
<P>
Stockton police said they have located all of Purdy's close
relatives, except for his mother, identified as 43-year-old Kathy
Snyder. Police said she has had four different surnames and that
when she renewed her driver's license a year ago, she used an
address in La Mesa that turned out to be a chemical shed.

GUNMAN ATTENDED SCHOOL HE TURNED INTO WAR ZONE; 
KILLER OF 5 A 'NORMAL STUDENT' 
</HL>

STOCKTON

<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a powerful assault rifle on a crowded school 
playground Tuesday, killing five children and wounding 29 more, had been a 
student at the school from kindergarten through third grade, officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation's significance was not immediately clear, although it appeared 
to suggest that the attack at Cleveland Elementary was not altogether random. 
Police officials said they still had not determined what set off Purdy, a 
troubled drifter in his mid-20s with a history of relatively minor brushes with 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
The midday attack, which lasted only minutes, ended when Purdy mortally wounded 
himself in the head with a pistol, leaving his motive unexplained. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why, and I probably won't ever know why," said Purdy's 
grandmother, 63-year-old Julia Chumbley, who lives nearby in Lodi. Other 
relatives described Purdy as a child alcoholic and a loner who had bounced 
across America, looking for work as a welder. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Elementary was in session today, although only a little more than 200 
pupils - roughly one-fourth of the student body - showed up for classes. 
</P>
<P>
Those who did attend were greeted at the school by escorts who guided them 
through a thicket of reporters and cameras. Counselors were stationed in each 
classroom to help the children come to grips with the horror of the previous 
day. Each child was given a stuffed animal at the principal's office. Teachers 
said they did not know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just try to get through the day," said Vicki Braga, who teaches fourth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
The front entrance of the school was decorated with bouquets of yellow 
gladioli, purple mums and five red roses. Someone also had placed there a pink 
teddy bear with angel's wings. A banner stretched across the front said 
"Racists are ugly - let's stop them." 
</P>
<P>
The banner's message enunciated an early suspicion that the racial composition 
of the student body might have contributed to Purdy's motivation. More than 600 
of the 980 students are the sons and daughters of refugees from Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Police, however, said there was as yet no evidence that race played a role. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether he had some feelings against the Southeast Asian community as a whole, 
we haven't determined that," said Stockton Police Capt. Dennis Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had not yet determined if any teachers at Cleveland Elementary 
were there when Purdy was in attendance from 1969 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
His record at the school showed "normal behavior," officials said. He 
transferred out in the third grade to a school in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators last night searched the Lodi motel room where Purdy had 
been staying. He had checked in the day after Christmas, and was paid up 
through Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
They found more than 100 plastic toy soldiers arrayed about the room, along 
with toy jeeps and tanks, in what appeared to be a imaginary battle scene. 
</P>
<P>
"What the significance is, I don't know," Perry said. "He obviously had a 
military hang-up of some kind."

Incense burned and Buddhist monks in saffron-colored robes chanted prayers of 
mourning Friday as the immigrant families of children slain in this week's 
schoolyard massacre were joined by scores of other members of Stockton's Asian 
community in vigils of grief. 
</P>
<P>
City officials readied the city's Civic Auditorium for a Monday memorial 
ceremony for the families and friends of a Vietnamese student and four 
Cambodian pupils gunned down in the playground at Cleveland Elementary School 
Tuesday by armed drifter Patrick Edward Purdy, who killed himself with a single 
pistol shot to the head. 
</P>
<P>
A separate funeral for 6-year-old Thuy Tran, the Vietnamese student killed in 
the shooting spree, will be held today. 
</P>
<P>
Vu-Duc Vuong, executive director of the city's Center for Southeast Asian 
Resettlement, said citizens throughout California will be asked to take part 
Monday in a five-minute period of silence starting at 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Five minutes for five children who are dead," Vuong said. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions Improved 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the 29 students injured in the attack remained in hospitals Friday, 
but in almost all cases, their conditions were reported improved. One teacher 
was also wounded and remains hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Buddhist priests led prayers at the homes of three Cambodian families Friday in 
mourning ceremonies that last three days and three nights. More than 100 people 
gathered at the Village Oak apartments, where the families of two victims, 
8-year-old Ram Chun and 6-year-old Sokhim An, live. Neighbors provided the five 
robed monks with incense, rice and money during their vigil. 
</P>
<P>
But a similar vigil at the home of a third victim, Rathanan Or, 9, was marred 
by a bitter reunion between the dead boy's parents. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Ly, 40, a Cambodian refugee from Ohio who recognized his son's face among 
televised pictures of children slain in the mass shooting spree, met for the 
first time since 1979 with family members grieving for his son. 
</P>
<P>
Watching News 
</P>
<P>
Ly said he was watching a news report about the massacre Tuesday morning in 
which five children and the gunman were killed when he spotted the picture of a 
9-year-old victim he recognized as his lost son. In a telephone call later that 
day, a Stockton official verified that "my son had been killed at school." 
</P>
<P>
"I almost passed out," Ly said. 
</P>
<P>
Now remarried with a 2-year-old son, Ly flew alone to Stockton on Thursday, 
where he was reunited with In Or, 36, Rathanan's mother and Ly's former wife. 
</P>
<P>
Ly insisted that Or knew of his existence in Ohio. Or had told reporters after 
Tuesday's shooting that her husband was reported killed in a firefight in 
Cambodia a decade ago. Or said Friday that she had no idea Ly had survived, and 
she complained that Ly had not been in touch with her or her children since he 
arrived in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He never introduced himself as the father of my boy until he was dead," Or 
said. "If he loved the kids, why didn't he come to support his child?" 
</P>
<P>
Ly said he had been in touch with his former family by sending money. He also 
said that soon after he had emigrated to Ohio, he learned that his wife and 
children were living in Stockton and tried unsuccessfully to visit them. 
</P>
<P>
"When I learned they were alive, I flew out here, but she didn't meet me," Ly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ly, who had been a captain in the Cambodian army, said that he became separated 
from Or, then three months pregnant with Rathanan, when the country was 
occupied by Khmer Rouge guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
He said he made his way to Thailand and came to the United States in 1980, 
settling in Canton, Ohio, where he has worked since as a cook in a 
German-American club. When he first arrived, thinking his family had perished, 
Ly said he remarried. He said that Or has been angry with him since she learned 
that he was alive and had a new wife. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the five victims are being aided by funds provided by the San 
Joaquin County Victim/Witness Assistance Program. The state-supported agency 
will provide up to $2,800 for each funeral and up to $46,000 for hospital and 
counseling expenses for victims and relatives, said Diane Beatrice, a 
spokeswoman for the county district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice added that "thousands and thousands of dollars" have been donated to 
the Cleveland School Memorial Fund, a program set up to help the families of 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gov. George Deukmejian, in an unusual letter to Atty. Gen John K. 
Van de Kamp, asked Friday for a complete report on Purdy's criminal record and 
detailed information about his weapons purchases. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Van de Kamp said the attorney general will cooperate fully with 
the governor and provide him with whatever information he requests. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, said in Sacramento that Deukmejian 
is seeking the information to help him assess various legislative proposals 
stemming from the shooting, including a proposed ban on the sale of 
military-style assault weapons, such as the AK-47 that Purdy used. 
</P>
<P>
"The deaths of five children and the injury of 30 others, all victims of a 
wanton and senseless act by a person who had a criminal record, raises a number 
of questions," Deukmejian said in his letter to the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Purdy was buried Friday in Lodi, a family spokesman said.
