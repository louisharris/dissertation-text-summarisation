Jurors Deadlocked on 13 Charges
</HL>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts
in the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they are
deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nation's longest,
costliest criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from the
jurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearing
for Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52
sealed verdicts.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would deal
with the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial on
those counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the jury
back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts.
</P>
<P>
He said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury
back. However, the judge noted that ``The attorneys are hopeful all
the counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts.''
Pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys before
quizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further.
</P>
<P>
The jurors are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and his
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent of
charges they molested children at their family-owned McMartin
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
The jury that spent 2{ years hearing evidence in the case have
agreed on 52 verdicts. They have all been sealed. None of the
verdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed by
the jury.
</P>
<P>
Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations. Buckey and his
mother are charged with 64 counts of child molestation and the one
shared count of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
One of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is
the conspiracy charge which names both defendants.
</P>
<P>
Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict
one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemed
perplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could
convict just one of the defendants on the charge ``if you feel that
the defendant conspired with one or more other persons.''
However, he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged
overt acts, some of them naming only one defendant. A split
verdict, he said, would require elimination of overt acts alleged
against a defendant acquitted of the charge.
</P>
<P>
It was at that point, he said, that some jurors began shaking
their heads in confusion.
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to stand
trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing. Five women teachers
who worked at the McMartin Pre-School had charges against them
dismissed. Among those were Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, and his
grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the prestigious but now
defunct nursery school.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, deliberations were halted at midday because a juror
became ill. On Wednesday, the talks did not begin until 1 p.m.
because another juror's child was ill.
</P>
<P>
No alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that
losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial.

Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin
Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors
botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of
justice over hysteria and hype.
</P>
<P>
Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and Raymond
Buckey, 31, wept as the verdicts were announced. Jurors found the
pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13
other counts. Prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges
in a new trial.
``I just said, `I told you Ray,''' Mrs. Buckey said. Asked if
her son was surprised, she said. ``He had fear, definitely.''
Buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his
lawyer.
``If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to
you, too. If it had not been in my faith in God I wouldn't be here
today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
But several parents of former students at the school said the
Buckeys won because the system lost.
``It was never done properly,'' said parent Alan Lagunoff, who
moved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach. ``I have
to sit back and figure out what to do with my son. I fear that
because of this verdict, no child will be seen as a credible
witness from now on.''
His son, now 10, attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't a
witness at the trial.
``I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into the
courts. It will just be another six-year travesty,'' Lagunoff said.
``The system is not going to protect children,'' said Jackie
McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but
didn't testify in the case. ``I don't know what the message is that
the jury wanted to get out. I'm anxious to hear that.''
Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and husband of Mrs. Buckey,
suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the
case for its entire six years, was motivated by personal ambition.
``My concern primarily was Lael Rubin, who is `anything goes' in
order to secure a conviction. ... If you don't win, you don't get
promoted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Juror Brenda Williams said the evidence failed to convince the
jury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges.
``Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't
necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,''
Ms. Williams told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail
during the case, which defense attorneys said was the result of
community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic
mother of one child at the preschool.
</P>
<P>
Some observers accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosian
of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-election
campaign against Ira Reiner, who beat him and now runs the district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
Philibosian, however, insisted he would not have handled the
matter differently.
``Ira Reiner has had that case for five years, and I am not
going to take any public criticism directed at me. Let him respond
to the criticism,'' said Philibosian, now in private law practice.
</P>
<P>
Also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a
private child therapy group, Children's Institute International, to
conduct the original interviews with the children. Defense
attorneys maintained that questions by the institute's researchers
were leading and prejudicial.
</P>
<P>
Jurors agreed.
``We never got the children's stories in their own words,'' said
juror John Breese.
</P>
<P>
Children's Institute officials didn't immediately return
telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
Originally, there were seven defendants, including Raymond
Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, the
founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother of
Raymond Buckey.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the
case, which gained worldwide attention with its tales of
underground tunnels at the school and Satanic rituals.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years as
Reiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendants
after reviewing the case. The underground tunnels were never found.
</P>
<P>
No proof was ever produced of Satanic rituals.
</P>
<P>
Reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long,
expensive prosecution.
``It took far too long and cost far too much money to have what
has been called perfect justice. We need reform,'' Reiner said,
adding that in trying to describe the case, ``Insane is the word
that comes to mind.''
The case was the longest and the costliest in American judicial
history, at 2{ years and $15 million. Superior Court Judge William
Pounders said he did what he could to limit its length, cutting 50
witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case.
</P>
<P>
For parents and others, there was more to ponder than legal
questions.
``Life is not fair. I tell my children all the time ... there is
no such thing as fair,'' said Robert Currie, whose son attended
McMartin but didn't testify at the trial.
``It's really a travesty for a case to take this long,'' said
Ms. Rubin, the prosecutor. ``...Not only for the families, the
children in this case, but also for the defendants as well.''

Jury Denounces Child Therapy Center, Police Letter

<P>
Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation
case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a
police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case.
</P>
<P>
Seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference
after acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin
Buckey, on 52 molestation charges Thursday said they felt some
children who testified may have been molested _ but not at the
family-run McMartin Pre-School.
</P>
<P>
And they said some children may have merely repeated stories
told them by their parents and interviewers at Children's Institute
International.
</P>
<P>
The private child therapy center, which specializes in abused
children, videotaped interviews with children from the McMartin
school after reports of molestations surfaced. Jurors saw the tapes
in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and
leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from
children.
</P>
<P>
Asked what led to acquittals, juror Brenda Williams focused on
the taped interviews from the center jurors call CII.
``The CII interviews _ I could not accept them,'' Mrs. Williams
said. ``I believe the children believe what they were saying was
true. But at CII, I could not tell if the children were saying what
was told to them (by interviewers) or if they were repeating what
their parents had told them.
``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had
not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,'''
Mrs. Williams said.
``The CII tapes did not help me. They gave me a lot of
reasonable doubt,'' agreed juror Julie Peters, 47, a supermarket
meat wrapper.
``The children were never allowed to say in their own words what
happened to them. All the questions were leading. They never had a
chance to tell their stories,'' said juror John Breese, 51, a
medical technician and grandfather of five.
``I tried to believe the children,'' said juror Daryl Hutchins
28, an oil company lease operator. ``But if the child was so
contaminated (by the interviews) I couldn't.''
Equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by the
Manhattan Beach Police Department to parents of McMartin school
children. The letter alerted parents to a claim of molestation at
the school and to Buckey's arrest.
``The police letter should never have been sent,'' said juror
Sally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker. ``It put the information
out there too early. The whole city knew.''
At that point, jurors said, they felt parents had been
programmed to believe their children had been molested.
``One child said his parents told him that he was molested even
before he went to CII,'' Mrs. Williams recalled.
</P>
<P>
The panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic
allegations, including some children's accounts of being molested
in a car wash. ``We just dismissed those,'' said Mrs. Williams.
</P>
<P>
They said a series of medical slides shown to them lacked impact
because they weren't sure what they were seeing in the photos of
children's genitals.
</P>
<P>
Although they acquitted defendants of most charges, the jurors
deadlocked on 13 counts. Some said they were unsure whether Buckey
was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove
its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they didn't rule out that some children in the case
were molested _ but not by these defendants.
``Even if you accept that the children were molested,'' said
juror Mark Bassett, ``the evidence didn't establish that they were
molested at the McMartin Pre-School.''
The panelists said they were aware of the trial's enormous toll
on defendants as well as children and parents.
``I think everybody is a victim,'' said Ms. Peters. ``I don't
think anybody came out of this case a winner. I think it's sad
because everybody lost something. The defendants _ their lives have
been ruined. They lost their business, their reputation. It's sad.''
Mrs. Williams added, ``The children have to live with this. The
parents have to live with this. There's nothing I can say that will
make it better.''
As for themselves, the jurors said their lives were ``put on
hold'' for nearly three years. Bassett lost his job as a research
computer scientist when his company folded. Mrs. Williams got
married. Breese said his wife died during the trial and he has
since remarried.
``It's been very hard,'' said Mrs. Williams, a telephone company
service representative. ``There were days when I thought I couldn't
stand it anymore.
``I don't really know my job anymore,'' she said. ``It's going
to be hard getting back into the real world.''
The jury foreman and four other jurors declined interviews.

<P>
The McMartin Pre-school molestation case was
the longest criminal trial in U.S. history. Here is a chronology of
the case:
</P>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<P>
_Aug. 12, 1983: Judy Johnson makes a phone call to Manhattan
Beach Police Department and tells Detective Jane Hoag that she
believes her 2{-year-old son was molested by Raymond Buckey at the
McMartin Pre-School.
_Sept. 7, 1983: Ms. Hoag arrests Buckey, but he is released
later that day for lack of evidence. Police continue the
investigation and stir controversy by sending letters to 200
parents naming Buckey as a child molestation suspect and asking
them to interrogate their children about oral sex, fondling of
genitals and sodomy.
_Fall of 1983 to spring of 1984: Nearly 400 children are
interviewed by Children's Institute International, and 41 are
listed as victims in a complaint filed by the state.
_Feb. 2, 1984: KABC-TV reporter Wayne Satz, in a newscast,
describes dozens of alleged acts of oral copulation and sodomy with
children.
_March 22, 1984: Public outcry prompts Los Angeles District
Attorney Robert Philibosian to send the case to grand jurors, who
indict Buckey; his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey; his sister, Peggy
Ann Buckey; his grandmother Virginia McMartin, and three employees,
Mary Ann Jackson, Babette Spitler and Betty Raidor, on 115 charges
of child molestation.
_March 24, 1984: All seven defendants are arrested and jailed.
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother are held without bail. Bail for he others
ranges from $50,000 to $350,000. Lael Rubin, Christine Johnston and
Glenn Stevens are assigned to the prosecution team. Stevens is
later removed for expressing doubts about evidence, and Ms.
</P>
<P>
Johnston asks for reassignment.
_April 20, 1984: The seven defendants plead innocent at an
arraignment, during which they are charged with sexually abusing 18
children over 10 years and using death threats to silence them.
_June 6, 1984: A preliminary hearing starts with Municipal Judge
Aviva K. Bobb presiding. Thirteen of the 41 alleged victims chosen
from CII interviews take the stand during the 18-month hearing.
_Jan. 22, 1985: The first child witness in the preliminary
hearing testifies that he and other pupils played ``naked games''
and that he had been touched on his genitals by some of the
defendants.
_Jan. 9, 1986: Judge Bobb orders all seven defendants to stand
trial in Superior Court on 135 counts of molestation and
conspiracy, ending the longest preliminary hearing in California
history. The cost of the hearing was estimated at $4 million.
_Jan. 17, 1986: District Attorney Ira Reiner says there is
insufficient evidence to warrant a trial for five of the seven
defendants and asks dismissal of charges against Virginia McMartin,
Peggy Ann Buckey, Mary Ann Jackson, Babette Spitler and Betty
Raidor. The remaining defendants, Buckey and his mother, still face
100 counts of molestation and conspiracy.
_Jan. 23, 1986: Mrs. Buckey is released on $295,000 bail,
reduced from $495,000.
_Dec. 19, 1986: Judy Johnson, the mother who made the first
allegations against Buckey, is found dead, naked and face down in
her home, at age 44. The coroner says she died of fatty
metamorphosis of the liver, an ailment commonly found in alcoholics.
_April 20, 1987: The trial begins with jury selection. By July
1, 12 jurors and six alternates are chosen from 500 prospective
panelists.
_July 13, 1987: Opening statements begin after efforts to move
the case elsewhere are quashed by Superior Court Judge William R.
</P>
<P>
Pounders.
_July 29, 1987: The first parent to testify says his daughter's
behavior indicates she may have been abused at the school, but he
didn't recognize the warning signs at the time.
_Dec. 10, 1987: Paul Bynum, 39, a former police officer who once
served as a defense investigator in the case, is found dead from an
apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

being jailed nearly five years.
_April 27, 1989: The trial, hitting the 2-year, 4-day mark,
becomes the longest criminal hearing in U.S. history when it
surpasses by one day the Hillside Strangler trial of Angelo Buono
in 1982-83.
_May 16, 1989: Peggy McMartin Buckey takes the stand for the
first time and strongly denies she ever sexually assaulted her
students.
_July 26, 1989: Buckey takes the stand and denies he has ever
molested children.
_Nov. 2, 1989: Jurors adjourn to select a foreman and begin
deliberations. The eight-men, four-women panel must sift through
volumes of testimony from 124 witnesses.
_Jan. 18, 1990: The jury acquits Buckey and his mother of 52
counts. The judge declares a mistrial on 13 other counts _ 12
against Buckey and one against both Buckey and his mother.

<P>
A therapist defended her interviews of
alleged victims in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial,
despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions
undermined the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother,
Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts and
deadlocked on 13 other counts.
</P>
<P>
Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds of
McMartin students, and suggested that the goals of therapy are at
odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal
prosecution.
``What is in the interest of children is not always in the
interest of the legal system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest
and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history included
videotaped interviews of the alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
Many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the
sexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane, a social worker and
director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's Institute
International.
</P>
<P>
MacFarlane said Thursday she still believes children from the
school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their
accounts of abuse.
``This agency would never have gone all the way through what we
have if we did not believe these children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
At least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed the
evidence showed children had been molested. But the jurors were
sharply critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute.
``The children were never allowed to say in their own words what
happened to them,'' said juror John Breese. ``All the questions
were leading.''
``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had
not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,''
juror Brenda Williams said.
</P>
<P>
But MacFarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound,
noting that small children must be interviewed differently than
adults.
``I didn't put words into their mouths,'' she said. ``I tried to
enable them to get over their fears.''
MacFarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been
done differently, including conducting more interviews over a
longer period of time. She called the outcome of the case a
``tragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to these
children.''
But the institute's executive director, Mary M. Emmons, said
some good may come out of the case.
``It has greatly increased the awareness about the issue of
child sexual abuse and about the problems of prosecuting these
cases,'' she said.

Blame Plentiful in Preschool Molestation Case

<P>
There was plenty of blame to go around at the
end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation
trial, but no one was willing to accept it.
</P>
<P>
In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and
his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52
child molestation charges. The jury deadlocked on 13 other charges.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the district attorney who filed the case criticized
the current district attorney. The current district attorney blamed
his predecessor and defense attorneys. And some of the parents of
children who attended the school blamed everybody.
``The system is not going to protect children,'' said Jackie
McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but
didn't testify in the case. ``Life is not fair,'' said Robert
Curry, whose son attended the McMartin school. ``I tell my children
all the time ... there is no such thing as fair.''
The district attorney who originally pursued the case said he
would not have done anything differently.
</P>
<P>
Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissed
accusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984 _ with the
news media acting as eager accomplices _ to boost his public
profile as he ran for district attorney.
``I was a professional prosecutor for 16 years before this case
was brought,'' he said. ``To have people who know very little about
professional or prosecutorial ethics, to criticize me personally
that I have some political motive is totally unjustified.''
Philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated
him, current District Attorney Ira Reiner. Philibosian said Reiner
hurt prosecutor's chances by dismissing charges against five of the
original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 ``60
Minutes'' interview.
</P>
<P>
But Reiner, calling his dismissal of charges for lack of
evidence ``the decision we're proud of,'' said the trial took so
long because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system,
delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by
Philibosian.
``This is a case I inherited,'' Reiner said.
</P>
<P>
In interviews, many jurors said they believed some of the
children were molested, but the prosecution never established that
the defendants were responsible.
``Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't
necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,''
said juror Brenda Williams.

``Ray Will Die'' is scrawled in
big black letters on the faded green paint of the McMartin
Pre-School, testimony to the rage inflamed by the notorious
child-molesting case.
</P>
<P>
Former McMartin teachers Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday of 52 charges of molesting
students. Jurors were deadlocked on 13 other counts.
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens on those charges, few in this
upper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb would disagree with the judge
in the trial, William Pounders, who once said, ``The case has
poisoned everyone who had contact with it.''
Sue Brown, a receptionist at a medical office across the street
from the school, said she had two friends who were involved in the
case and had been convinced of the Buckeys' guilt.
``I think they got off scot-free,'' Brown said. ``I'm really
sick about it.''
Alan Lagunoff, whose son, now 10, testified against the Buckeys,
stood in front of the run-down, long-closed nursery school and
talked about his disappointment.
``The defense did everything to prolong the case and the
prosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the case
properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
A cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as Lagunoff
leaned on the rusted chain-link fence surrounding the dilapidated
L-shaped building.
``I'd like to see the school become a center for abused
children,'' he said. ``It should be put to some good use rather
than tear it down.''
But another longtime Manhattan Beach resident disagreed.
``I'd like to see it torn down,'' said Brenda Platt. ``I'd like
to have no memories of this.''
Platt, who has two children aged 1 and 3, said she has serious
doubts about placing them in a day-care center because of the
McMartin trial.
``I think (the McMartin case) is a disgrace to Manhattan Beach
and society. It's totally upsetting,'' Platt said.
</P>
<P>
Linda Geisert, another resident of the beach city, was also
upset.
``I'm greatly disappointed in the legal system and quite frankly
in the jurors,'' Geisert said.
</P>
<P>
For all his disappointment, Lagunoff said he did not feel the
prosecutors should retry the remaining 13 counts.
``It would be just more of the same circus,'' he said.
``We put so much faith and hope in our courts,'' said Robert
Canter, 74. ``And this is what we get _ frustration.''

MCMARTIN VERDICT: NOT GUILTY; 
JUSTICE: THE JURY'S FINDINGS CLOSE THE LONGEST AND COSTLIEST CRIMINAL TRIAL IN 
HISTORY. NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE ON RETRYING RAY BUCKEY ON 13 UNDECIDED 
COUNTS. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty 
Thursday of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in 
Manhattan Beach, a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest 
criminal trial in history. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-man, four-woman jury - 10 of the members parents themselves - 
acquitted the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation after deliberating for nine 
weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two 
years. The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a 
mistrial was declared on those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey, 31, left the courtroom without comment - free on his own 
recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will 
retry him on the 13 undecided counts. But his 63-year-old mother and 
co-defendant reacted with anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone through hell and now we've lost everything," she said outside the 
court. "My concern was for my son and what they've done to him . . . because my 
son would never harm a child." 
</P>
<P>
Most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been 
molested, but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the Buckeys were culpable. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not convinced that he (Ray Buckey) is innocent," said juror Sally 
Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker. "But it was not proven to me that he did 
it. Whether I believe he did it and whether it was proven are very different." 
</P>
<P>
The end of the case came in a tense and crowded courtroom. The Buckeys, who 
spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system, had sat 
silently, staring straight ahead, as the jury filed into the room shortly 
before 10:30 a.m. and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in 
anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
"All the verdicts are the same," said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William 
Pounders, handing them to his court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Clerk Stan Ferrell listed the counts numerically and then, reading from the 
verdict form, delivered in a single, almost anti-climactic sentence the 
historic trial's close: 
</P>
<P>
"We the jury in the above entitled actions find the defendants not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
The quiet of the courtroom was split by a few gasps and sobs. At first, the 
defendants remained stoic, then their eyes began to rim with tears. Ray 
Buckey's lower lip quivered. His mother dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. 
They said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Peggy McMartin Buckey insisted she was not bitter. "I knew God would 
set my son and me free because we have done nothing," she said as she was 
driven away. Her optimism was not matched by her son, however, who she said had 
"had fear, definitely," about what the jury would decide. 
</P>
<P>
"I held his hand," Buckey's mother said after the verdicts were announced, "and 
I told him: 'I told you, Ray,' and he felt like he wanted to cry but he 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history, a case that 
stemmed from a 2 1/2-year-old's report to his mother six years ago that he had 
been sodomized at his school by a "Mr. Ray." The case ultimately cost taxpayers 
more than $15 million, altered scores of lives and careers, and provided a 
national focal point for the issue of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Pounders said he was not surprised by the verdicts: "I found it difficult 
to determine how they would view the evidence in the first place. I thought 
that based on the evidence that was presented, the jury could do almost 
anything and still find rational support for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to test the credibility of children, and when you go 
beyond that, the natural tendency for adults is to look for corroboration. It 
was very difficult to find corroboration in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the case was worth its cost in money, lives and stress, Pounders said 
he thinks society benefited from the case. 
</P>
<P>
"People will be much more alert to the possibility of this type of offense 
taking place at preschool and at schools," Pounders said. "People are no longer 
dropping their children off and walking away blindly. They look back. They 
check things out more." 
</P>
<P>
In the crowded courthouse hallways, parents of alleged victims lashed out at 
the prosecutors for bungling the case and insisted that their children had not 
been well served by the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
"The system doesn't allow us to protect kids," said the father of two alleged 
victims. "I have no doubt these children were abused. 
</P>
<P>
Said a tearful mother: "I guess maybe it's OK to (molest) kids! I can't believe 
this." 
</P>
<P>
The children themselves reacted calmly and stood by their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that we are telling the truth," said a 15-year-old boy who had 
testified. "No matter what the jury says, whatever anybody says, this is the 
truth. We were molested." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the children said that, when the clerk read "not guilty" on the 
verdict form, "my stomach just hollowed out. I was beyond tears. Those words 
will stick with me probably the rest of my life. I'll never forget those two 
words." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were critical of the prosecutors' methods. In particular, they cited the 
prosecution's reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of 
the young witnesses at a Los Angeles child-abuse center. They also criticized 
the Manhattan Beach Police Department's decision, early in the investigation, 
to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and 
soliciting information. 
</P>
<P>
"The children," said juror John Breese, 51, a biomedical technician, "were 
never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them. That was 
crucial." 
</P>
<P>
Said jury foreman Luis Chang, an electrical engineer: "The key evidence that 
swayed me was the interview tapes. They were too biased, too leading. That's 
the main crux of it." 
</P>
<P>
All said they had entered the jury deliberation room with open minds, not only 
because the judge had so instructed, but also because the disjointed testimony 
had left them confused. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into the jury room as confused and uncertain as I was the day I first 
sat in the jury box the first day of this trial," said Brenda Williams, 38, a 
Pacific Bell service representative. "I felt I had missed out on something, 
maybe I had dozed off during some important testimony and I was hoping some of 
my fellow jurors had something in their notes that I didn't have in mine that 
would make it all come together." 
</P>
<P>
Said juror Mark Bassett, 33, a computer specialist: "We just didn't really know 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the case, said a decision has not 
been made about whether to pursue the 13 counts involved in a mistrial. These 
counts involve 12 molestation charges against Ray Buckey, and a conspiracy 
count that accused both him and his mother. The conspiracy count against Peggy 
McMartin Buckey was dismissed outright Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We ultimately must respect the jury's decision," Rubin said, "even though I 
personally disagree with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The system worked well for them," she said in reference to the Buckeys. "They 
were lucky. I just hope to God that years from now we don't hear about Ray 
Buckey molesting children." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner blamed the criminal justice system 
for the length of the trial, and said he backs two state court-reform 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much time and too much money has gone into this case. This is insane. The 
very idea a case can go to trial for 2 1/2 years and there can be a rational 
result is preposterous. The McMartin case is the very worst example that we 
have, period. But it does not stand alone." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Dean Gits and Danny Davis were beaming after the verdict 
announcement. "I feel great," Gits said, indicating he had found hope that the 
decision would go the defense way last week when the jury informed the judge it 
was reaching deadlock on a conspiracy count. 
</P>
<P>
With the acquittal, Pounders freed more than $3 million worth of property that 
had been posted by Buckey supporters as bail last year so that he could be 
released after five years in jail. Buckey's mother had been free on a smaller 
bail amount earlier after spending nearly two years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin case - which included allegations not only of rape, sodomy, oral 
copulation, and other sex crimes, but also of pornographic photography 
sessions, "naked games," field trips away from the school for illicit purposes, 
animal mutilation, threats and satanic-like ritual and sacrifice - began in 
the fall of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of a 2 1/2-year-old complained to Manhattan Beach police that her 
son had been sodomized by "Mr. Ray," and subsequent physical examinations 
indicated he had been sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey was arrested in September of that year, but was released as the 
investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the 
Manhattan Beach nursery school, among them his grandmother, dozens of 
"uncharged suspects," and eight other South Bay nursery schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach Police Department sent a form letter to hundreds of 
McMartin school parents asking for information, and a wave of hysteria swept 
through the affluent beach town. Many parents took their youngsters to 
Children's Institute International, a Los Angeles child-abuse diagnostic and 
treatment center, for evaluation; the majority were told that their children 
had been victimized. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1984, Ray Buckey was rearrested, along with his sister, Peggy Ann 
Buckey, his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, 
and teachers Betty Raidor, Babette Spitler and Mary Ann Jackson. A county grand 
jury had indicted them on 115 counts; that indictment was superseded in May by 
a criminal complaint charging them with 208 counts involving 41 children. 
</P>
<P>
The case was hastily filed, and it was flawed from the beginning. Then-Dist. 
Atty. Robert Philibosian, running for reelection, and the media, which caught 
wind of the investigation, were pressing for action. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Institute International, deluged with concerned parents, enlisted 
untrained therapists to assess the children, resulting in videotaped interviews 
filled with leading and suggestive questions that would later prove 
embarrassing to the prosecution and provide the defense with grounds for 
claiming that the alleged victims had been programmed to believe that they had 
been molested. 
</P>
<P>
Hysteria grew. Hundreds of South Bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide 
conspiracy and pornography ring, it was alleged, and an angry mob spray-painted 
"Ray Must Die" on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an 
adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-month preliminary hearing, which began in the fall of 1984, was marked 
by frequent shouting matches between three prosecutors, nine defense attorneys 
and Municipal Judge Aviva Bobb, and lengthy questioning of child witnesses that 
lasted in one instance for 16 days. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was riveted by the daily images of youngsters clambering atop a 
booster chair in their Sunday best to face their alleged molesters. They 
munched cookies, swigged root beer, and sometimes sobbed as they told of their 
experiences at McMartin. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most poignant moment came when an 8-year-old girl told in a wispy 
voice of having been raped, photographed, tied up and placed in a dark closet 
by her teachers five years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Bobb ordered all seven defendants to stand trial on 135 charges, 
telling each, "The court believes there is sufficient cause to believe you are 
guilty." The remaining charges had been dropped after only 14 of the scheduled 
child witnesses came forward to testify. One child was allowed to testify by 
closed-circuit television, under a new state law passed especially for the 
McMartin case. 
</P>
<P>
But a week later, in January, 1986, the new district attorney, Ira Reiner, who 
had inherited the case from Philibosian, dropped charges against five of the 
seven defendants, citing "incredibly weak evidence" and deciding to proceed 
only against Ray Buckey and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
The trial itself began with jury selection in April, 1987. Testimony began in 
July. The scope of the trial was narrowed again when several parents decided 
not to allow their children to testify. Eventually nine of 11 named victims 
took the witness stand, all sticking to their earlier accounts, but for minor 
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
Toddlers at the time of their alleged abuse and now nearing adolescence, they 
described in graphic detail the abuses they say they suffered at the hands of 
the Buckeys. Their testimony was often raw and unsettling. The children's 
allegations were supported by medical evidence testified to by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
But both Buckey and his mother also took the stand and staunchly maintained 
their innocence. And fellow teachers, including former defendants, testified 
that no improprieties in the small school could have occurred without their 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution sought to show that the children repeatedly had been abused 
sexually, but silenced for years by threats, and also that their child-like 
efforts to tell their parents that something was wrong had been ignored or 
misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
The defense contended that nothing untoward happened at the school, but that 
the children were programmed by therapists to believe that something bad had 
happened to them. It claimed that their stories defied common sense and that 
the medical evidence was unreliable and perhaps fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-long case was marked by twists and turns and tragedies, prompting 
the judge to comment that it had "poisoned" everyone it had touched. Day after 
day, it was punctuated with the unexpected and bizarre: 
</P>
<P>
* Ailing family matriarch Virginia McMartin, now 82, wrote poetry, conducted 
colorful hallway interviews and tested the judge's patience with such outbursts 
as, "This awful court. These awful people. These awful lies." 
</P>
<P>
* Therapist Kee MacFarlane, who conducted many of the interviews in which 
children first disclosed that they had been molested, came under fire when it 
was revealed not only that she had minimal previous experience in the field but 
also that she was involved romantically with the television newsman who broke 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
* Former prosecutor Glenn Stevens became a key defense witness after leaking 
information that he believed that the defendants were innocent, and signed a 
movie contract to tell his revised version of events. 
</P>
<P>
* A 10-year-old boy, testifying at the preliminary hearing, identified everyone 
from the city attorney and a movie star to a priest and four nuns as among his 
molesters, and painted a picture of marching with his classmates to a cemetery 
where they dug up corpses with shovels and pick-axes. 
</P>
<P>
KEY FIGURES IN THE McMARTIN TRIAL 
</P>
<P>
THE JUDGE: 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM R. POUNDERS, 50 - Superior Court judge since 1985. A former state 
prosecutor who also did appellate work, he was assigned to the case after the 
litigants rejected three other judges as prejudiced. An intellectual who often 
uses expressions derived from his Air Force experience building nuclear 
missiles, Pounders' strengths are meticulous organization and an extensive 
knowledge of the law, which he augments with a 3-by-5 index card file system, 
as well as a new computer. A graduate of Loyola Law School, he is widely 
respected as a fair and thorough judge. 
</P>
<P>
THE DEFENDANTS: 
</P>
<P>
RAY BUCKEY, 31 - Key defendant in the McMartin case, Buckey is the grandson of 
nursery school founder Virginia McMartin and son of co-defendant Peggy McMartin 
Buckey. A quiet man who is a college dropout and has admitted having problems 
with drugs and alcohol, Buckey worked briefly at a San Diego child care center 
before joining his family's enterprise in Manhattan Beach. He was charged on 52 
counts of child molestation involving 11 children and one count of conspiracy 
shared with his mother. He denied all allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
PEGGY MCMARTIN BUCKEY, 63 - Co-defendant in the McMartin case, she both 
directed the Virginia McMartin Pre-School and taught there. She also hired her 
son as a teacher. A talkative, religious woman who drew pictures throughout the 
tedious proceedings and crocheted during breaks, she was charged on 12 counts 
of molestation involving four children and one count of conspiracy. She has 
maintained that neither she nor any member of her staff engaged in improper 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
THE PROSECUTORS: 
</P>
<P>
LAEL R. RUBIN, 47 - Co-prosecutor. A former high school English teacher, Rubin 
was a latecomer to the legal profession, graduating from the University of West 
Los Angeles School of Law in 1978. She quickly distinguished herself after 
joining the district attorney's office, successfully prosecuting "Black Cathy" 
Wilson for child pornography, Harry Sassounian for the assassination of the 
Turkish consul general in Los Angeles, and his brother, Harout Sassounian, for 
firebombing the Turkish consul general's house. She is the only original 
prosecutor remaining on the McMartin case. 
</P>
<P>
ROGER J. GUNSON, 50 - Co-prosecutor. A 20-year veteran of the district 
attorney's office and a graduate of UCLA Law School, the soft-spoken, 
unassuming Gunson most recently served as head deputy in the Sex Crimes and 
Child Abuse Division. He successfully prosecuted film director Roman Polanski 
for unlawful sex with a minor, and Susan Brophy, wife of former state 
assemblyman Bill Brophy, for vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS: 
</P>
<P>
amp; Charles for two years before turning to criminal law. 
Initially hired by the Buckey family, he was appointed to finish the case after 
their money ran out. He owns the now-defunct nursery school. 
</P>

MCMARTIN LAWSUITS MAY GO ON FOR YEARS 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the historic McMartin Pre-School criminal trial finally has ended in 
acquittals, a host of civil lawsuits generated by the Manhattan Beach 
molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for 
decades, legal experts say. 
</P>
<P>
A confusing array of civil actions await resolution. These include a federal 
civil rights suit filed Friday by Peggy McMartin Buckey against her accusers 
and others; a lawsuit filed by former defendants against a television station 
and reporter and suits the pre-school owners have filed against their liability 
insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Ray Buckey might file a federal suit similar to that of his mother, said 
his attorney, Scott Bernstein. And an attorney representing several parents of 
McMartin attendees said they might now refile lawsuits against the pre-school 
for emotional distress allegedly suffered by the children. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced this case will never end," Eli Gauna, who represents Babette 
Spitler, a former teacher at the school, said wearily. "It will always be 
there, until everyone who was ever involved gets to old age or dies." 
</P>
<P>
In the criminal case - the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S. 
history - Ray Buckey, 31, and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were 
acquitted Thursday of 52 counts of molestation involving 11 youngsters who 
attended the family nursery school in Manhattan Beach. The jury deadlocked on 
13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations. A 
decision is expected next week over whether those charges will be refiled 
against Ray Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was a high mark, but not the final moment, in a lengthy and 
entangled legal saga. The criminal case began in March, 1984, when seven 
McMartin teachers were indicted by a county grand jury on 115 counts of 
molestation. The indictment was superseded by a criminal complaint of 208 
counts of molestation and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
After an 18-month preliminary hearing, all seven were ordered to stand trial. 
Defendants included Buckey; his mother; his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who 
was the school founder; his sister Peggy Ann Buckey; and teachers Spitler, 
Betty Raidor and Mary Ann Jackson. But a week after the hearing ended, Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner dropped charges against the latter five defendants citing 
"incredibly weak evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the criminal case went to trial, civil litigation already was in 
the works. In 1984, a handful of lawsuits were filed by 22 families seeking 
monetary damages against the school for medical bills, cost of psychiatric 
therapy and emotional distress arising from the alleged molestations. But those 
lawsuits later were withdrawn to prevent the children's psychiatric histories 
from being introduced as evidence in the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Mooney, an attorney who represented some of the plaintiffs, explained that 
during the criminal preliminary hearing, defense attorneys had sought 
psychiatric records of the alleged victims. Defense attorneys argued that they 
should be entitled to the records because the children had waived their 
patient-therapist confidentiality by filing civil suits in which their 
psychiatric histories would be at issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The civil suits were withdrawn so they would not become an issue in the 
criminal case," Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Friday, however, that the civil lawsuits can now be refiled. Mooney 
said a decision on whether to refile will be made only after authorities decide 
what to do with the 13 remaining criminal counts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to predict how many parents will want to sue," Mooney said. 
"Somewhere between a handful and a bushelful." 
</P>
<P>
Any new suits would have to be filed only on behalf of the children. The 
parents could not seek damages on their own, because the one-year statute of 
limitations - the deadline in which a lawsuit can be filed - has passed. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, children who allege abuse have until they are 19 years old to 
file. Many of the children who attended McMartin are now entering their early 
teens, but the youngest of those who attended the school then is now 8 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts, however, say some courts have held that child abuse victims can 
file at any time in their life. In the so-called delayed-discovery theory, a 
statute of limitations does not take effect until the victim actually becomes 
aware of molestation, and some victims might suppress memories of such attacks 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility that hangs over the former defendants," said attorney 
Gauna, noting a recent landmark California court decision that set aside the 
statute of limitations for certain victims. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney said he knows of families that, seeking legal advantage, waited for the 
criminal trial to end before contemplating civil action. He explained that some 
families believed they might have a better advantage in civil court rather than 
in a criminal case: the burden of proof in civil litigation is the 
preponderance of the evidence, not reasonable doubt, as in a criminal trial. 
Also, in a civil case, only nine of the 12 jurors must agree on a verdict. 
Criminal convictions require unanimous juries. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the families would be willing to tackle more years of legal proceedings 
is yet to be seen. And some families question whether the McMartin defendants' 
insurance carriers would pay out to plaintiffs who successfully sued the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been any decisions yet. The parents need a little space between 
the events of this week and deciding what they will do," Mooney said. "There is 
some sentiment that says, 'Let's just put this behind us.' But there is also 
sentiment among others that maybe they should pick up the civil case where the 
criminal case left off. 
</P>
<P>
"They heard the jurors when they said they believed that things happened to the 
children. They think maybe since the criminal jury couldn't get the higher 
standard of proof, a civil jury would bring about a resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Said one McMartin attendee's parent, who asked not to be identified: "I might 
be tempted to file a civil suit to provide a trust fund for my child. But there 
apparently isn't any money there to be had." The only other reasons for filing 
such a suit, the parent added, would be "to work through a lot of emotional 
things, and we have already done that by participating in the criminal 
proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
Gauna, Spitler's attorney, said the litigation will go on because "maybe a 
half-dozen to a dozen hard-line parents won't let it go away. They will live 
this case until the day they die." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, already wending its way through court is a lawsuit filed by the 
early defendants. Peggy Ann Buckey, Virginia McMartin, Spitler and Raidor are 
suing the television station, the reporter who broke the McMartin story and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the station and reporter, Wayne Satz, were "creating 
rather than reporting the news." A lower court held that the station, KABC, was 
protected from the action on constitutional grounds, but a state appellate 
court ruled the case should proceed to trial, and the state Supreme Court 
upheld that decision. 
</P>
<P>
The case, now in the early pretrial stages, is being watched closely, because 
it could set precedent in the field of press law, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Another suit pits former McMartin defendants and the pre-school against their 
liability insurance carriers. The McMartin side alleges that the insurance 
carriers were required by the policy to pay for their attorney bills. 
</P>
<P>
While the insurers have paid a portion of the defense costs, they contend the 
defendants should have used only one attorney. However, the defendants are 
arguing that because of possible conflicts of interest, each needed their own 
counsel. One of the former defendants, preschool teacher Maryann Jackson, 
settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
As it becomes apparent that McMartin cases will stretch out for years to come, 
parents and the former criminal defendants alike are trying to resign 
themselves to the inevitability that the matter may be one they can never leave 
behind. Soon, some of the children will be able to make their own legal 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Noted one parent: "It's really not our decision as parents anymore. These 
children will soon be adults."

TRIAL FINALE IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF TV DEALS; 
MEDIA: MCMARTIN STORY IS HEADED FOR THE SMALL SCREEN AND BOOKSTORE SHELVES. BUT 
RETELLING THE CASE PRESENTS SOME TRICKY LEGAL AND MORAL PROBLEMS. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geraldo Rivera was interviewing Peggy Ann Buckey on TV. Abby Mann watched, 
listened - and saw the makings of a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey, one 
of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case. In that 1986 
interview, Peggy Buckey was "quite eloquent" in arguing that charges against 
her brother, Ray, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, should be dropped as well, 
Mann recalled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, an Oscar- and Emmy-winning screenwriter and producer, recognized a theme 
he had tapped before: the hysteria of a witch hunt. Soon, Mann became a 
controversial figure in the case itself - but he got the inside track on movie 
and book deals. And Thursday's not-guilty verdicts in Ray and Peggy McMartin 
Buckey's trial gave Mann the happy ending he was hoping for - happy, at least, 
from his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
But Mann and his wife, Myra, who have an 800-page manuscript in the works for 
Random House and say they are close to finishing a screenplay, aren't expected 
to monopolize the telling of the 6-year-old McMartin case - or the 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other books are planned, and at least one prominent television 
movie producer besides Mann says he is developing a McMartin project. That 
producer, who requested anonymity, said he is certain other producers are 
considering projects as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a TV thing," one agent said. "Just one of those perfect, 
high-concept, lurid television M-O-Ws" - an acronym for movies-of-the-week. 
"The producer chases down participants, gets rights - and then it's an easy 
sale to networks." 
</P>
<P>
Not that easy, network executives say. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the hottest true-life property of the moment - the Stuart murder case 
in Boston, which has CBS and The Fries Co. racing to produce the first 
docudrama - McMartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems. The jury's 
deadlock on 13 counts creates an ambiguity: Is Ray Buckey a villain or a 
victim? 
</P>
<P>
"None of the three networks would touch Ray Buckey's story," predicted Steven 
White, an independent producer who used to be a movie executive for both NBC 
and ABC. "First, the man is still accused of 13 crimes. . . . If I were sitting 
in my old job, I wouldn't touch this thing with a 10-foot pole." 
</P>
<P>
"It raises so many legal and ethical questions at this point it would have to 
be looked at with a microscope," said Larry Strichman, a senior executive in 
movie development at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the story you want to tell? Is it a story of justice done or justice 
denied? And it's real unclear at the moment what the answer to that question 
is. Unlike a documentary, it's hard to take an ambiguous position in a 
docudrama." 
</P>
<P>
Producers think network qualms can be overcome, however. One pointed out that 
the Billionaire Boys Club docudrama was broadcast before all the trials 
regarding the slayings were over. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no rules," the producer said. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's role in the McMartin case came to prominence early. Not long after 
the first allegations of child molestation six years ago, several producers 
pitched projects to networks. Though no explicit McMartin story was produced, 
child abuse and molestation was a recurring subject. One CBS fictional movie 
last year - "Did You Know the Muffin Man?" - featured a preschool and satanic 
child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, whose writing credits include the Academy Award-winning "Judgment at 
Nuremberg" in 1961, won an Emmy for "The Marcus-Nelson Murders," a three-hour 
"Kojak" drama based on a true case in which a black youth was wrongly convicted 
of the killings of two white women. The prosecutors, the media and the 
community seemed blinded by hysteria, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaining the confidence of the McMartin defendants, the Manns were ultimately 
hired as "investigators" by the defense. That and their earlier alliance with 
former prosecutor Glenn Stevens sparked charges from parents of alleged child 
molestation victims of a conspiracy to obstruct justice for monetary gain. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who said he had asked to be removed from the McMartin trial team in 
October, 1985, said he and Mann agreed in March, 1986, to produce a book and 
movie about the case with the understanding that their discussions would become 
public after the trial and appeals were over. But in late 1986, Mann released 
interviews with Stevens in which Stevens said he doubted the defendants' guilt. 
Mann said his attorneys had advised him that to withhold them would be an 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged parents suggested the real aim was a not-guilty verdict, which would 
improve the value of Mann's movie deal. But Stevens and the Manns have said 
their ambition from the start has been to get the truth out. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other perspectives may reach the bookstores. Ray Buckey's lawyer, 
Danny Davis, and writer Gordon Dillow, former columnist for the defunct Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner, have a book proposal that is being pitched to a 
variety of publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Lois Timnick, who covered the case from its early stages 
through the trial, also is planning a book. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said his script isn't a courtroom drama. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a trial movie. It's what happens to human beings. I intend to be fair 
to the parents. I don't mean to be vindicative. . . . For the most part, I have 
great sympathy for the parents."

MCMARTIN CASE FALLOUT TAKES ITS TOLL ON MINISTER; 
RELIGION: HE SAYS YEARS OF 'EXTREME STRESS' FIGHTING RUMORS THAT SATANIC 
RITUALS WERE PERFORMED AT HIS CHURCH HAVE FORCED HIM TO SEEK DISABILITY 
RETIREMENT. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hermosa Beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying 
his church to the McMartin Pre-School scandal announced Sunday that the 
"extreme stress" of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church - where McMartin pupils 
claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals - told the 
congregation during his sermon that, "after much prayer and consultation," he 
realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and 
vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin case, which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial 
in U.S. history, ended Thursday with the acquittal of defendants Ray Buckey and 
Peggy McMartin Buckey on a total of 52 counts of child molestation at the 
Manhattan Beach school. The jurors deadlocked on 13 other counts. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the case continues to divide and haunt the South Bay communities 
where it was centered. 
</P>
<P>
St. Cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither Eales nor any 
other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged. 
</P>
<P>
But since 1985, the church has struggled to shake a McMartin pupil's allegation 
during the preliminary hearing that, six years earlier, he and other students 
had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar 
of St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
When the then-10-year-old boy's allegation was reported in the local media, 
other children claimed that they too had been abused at the church. Though 
investigators using sophisticated equipment checked the altar and found no 
trace of blood, attendance dropped drastically at the church and the church-run 
preschool, which closed soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations never died, despite the passage of time and the announcement by 
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators that they had found no evidence to 
support the children's claims. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically over the years, Eales said, he would receive threatening phone 
calls at the church and rectory, and the harassment increased as the McMartin 
case began to wind down. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in December, the church and rectory were pelted with bottles and rotten 
eggs. In a note left in the rectory driveway after the second attack, the 
vandals, who identified themselves as "the Beach Cities' Conscience," warned 
that "there is simply no place for Satan worship in this town." 
</P>
<P>
The harassment was exacerbated by the arrest shortly after Christmas of a youth 
counselor at the church, who was charged with molesting two teen-age boys he 
had met through his work at St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
The counselor, it turned out, was a convicted child molester who had been 
brought into the fold about a year and a half earlier by an assistant pastor 
who was hired after the McMartin case broke. Then, just days after that 
assistant pastor resigned, the McMartin verdict came down, and, according to 
several church members, the anonymous phone calls returned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a violin string - you can only tighten it so far and then 
it snaps," Eales said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Though at 61 Eales has 11 more years until the diocese would mandate his 
retirement, he said his doctors told him that "the kind of stress you have been 
under kills." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, he said, he plans to extend a medical leave already scheduled 
to allow for some minor surgery next week and retire a year short of the 
10-year tenure that was his goal when he came to St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
His decision shocked and saddened parishioners, who credited Eales with 
shepherding the church through difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ron Russell, a 16-year member of the congregation: 
</P>
<P>
"We brought a good, strong man in here, and - well, this has ruined him."
