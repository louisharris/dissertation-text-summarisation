<P>
Beverly Sills, Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden
and Phyllis Newman are among performers who will sing, act and make
guest appearances at a birthday bash in August for conductor
Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a benefit
concert scheduled for the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to
raise money for the Tanglewood Music Center, where Bernstein got
his conducting start.
</P>
<P>
Sills will be host. Performances will include the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Pops Orchestra and the Tanglewood
Festival Chorus under the direction of some of the many conductors
whose careers have been guided by Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
Bacall and soprano Barbara Hendricks will perform a movement
from Bernstein's Symphony No. 3, ``Kaddish.'' Violin soloist Midori
will play two movements from his ``Serenade.''
The concert will celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments in
popular music with excerpts from ``West Side Story,'' ``On the
Town'' and others. Dame Gwyneth Jones and Frederica von Stade will
be among those performing highlights from ``Fidelio,'' ``Tristan
und Isolde'' and other works to honor Bernstein's landmark opera
recordings.
</P>
<P>
Tickets start at $20 for a spot on the lawn and run up to $5,000

Actresses Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden and
Phyllis Newman are among performers in the birthday bash being
thrown in August for conductor Leonard Bernstein at the music
center where he got his start.
</P>
<P>
The Tanglewood Music Center also is celebrating the 50th
anniversary of its Music Shed this summer with a special concert by
the resident Boston Symphony Orchestra featuring the same music,
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, that inaugurated the building in 1938.
</P>
<P>
The Bernstein weekend alone, with tickets as high as $5,000
each, may bring in more than $1 million for the festival's
endowment fund, according to Caroline Smedvig of the symphony.
``Because Tanglewood is so special for him and, conversely, he's
so special to us, the combination will produce what we hope will be
a unique event,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a four-day
affair beginning on the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to raise
money for the music center.
</P>
<P>
Beverly Sills, who announced last month that she will step down
as general director of the New York City Opera, will be the host of
the event. Bacall and soprano Barbara Hendricks will perform a
movement from Bernstein's Symphony No. 3, ``Kaddish.'' Violin
soloist Midori will play two movements from his ``Serenade.''
Dame Gwyneth Jones and Frederica von Stade will be among those
performing highlights from ``Fidelio'' and other works to honor
Bernstein's landmark opera recordings.
</P>
<P>
The concert will also celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments in
popular music with excerpts from such works as ``West Side Story''
and ``On the Town.''
The orchestra opened the nine-week season with the special July
1 concert marking the first half-century of the Music Shed.
</P>
<P>
The season of classical music will be expanded with performances
by such popular rock, jazz and folk artists as The Beach Boys,
George Benson and Leo Kottke.
</P>
<P>
But the highlight of the new season is the celebration of
Bernstein's birthday.
</P>
<P>
The BSO is even billing the birthday party as ``one of the music
world's great occasions'' and is negotiating the television rights
in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Among the conductor's friends who have been invited to the bash
are pop star Michael Jackson and British Princess Diana, although
Tanglewood officials say the have not yet received an answer from
the celebrities.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was a member of the original Tanglewood Music Center
class of 1940, where he became a protege of Tanglewood founder
Serge Koussevitzky.
</P>
<P>
When Koussevitzky retired in 1949, he tried to have the young
Bernstein named as his successor, but the BSO's trustees chose
Charles Munch because they considered Bernstein too young and
tainted by popular music.
</P>
<P>
He later wrote the score for the musical ``West Side Story'' and
returned every summer to conduct and teach.
</P>
<P>
Conductors Seiji Ozawa, John Williams, John Mauceri and Michael
Tillson Thomas will share the poduim featuring some of his works on
the night of his birth.
</P>
<P>
The following night, Ozawa and special guests will appear in a
Music Shed concert for a performance intended to show Bernstein's
influence on other musicians.
</P>
<P>
Aug. 27 will be given over to a performance of Bernstein's
``Mass'' by a 250-member troupe from the Indiana University school
of music.
</P>
<P>
The four-day celebration concludes with Bernstein conducting the
annual Serge and Ola Koussevitzky Memorial Concert, including a
performance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5, on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
All proceeds go to the music center's endowment fund, and to a
fund Bernstein established for aspiring young conductors. Ticket
prices start at $20 for a space on the lawn and go up to $5,000 for
front row seats for benefactors.
</P>
<P>
Other highlights of the new season include several major debuts,
including that of Soviet painist Vladimir Feltsman, who arrived in
the United States last August after an an eight-year battle to
emigrate; a return visit by the Israel Philharmonic; and a recital
by Irish flutist James Galway.
</P>
<P>
This summer is the second in a four-year jubilee of the
festival's 50th anniversary. Events climax in 1990 with observances
marking the 50th year of the music center, the festival's school.

Bernstein Celebrates 45th Conducting Anniversary
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in August
was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall with
the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphant
conducting debut there with the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
And of course, Monday night's program consisted of three
Bernstein compositions that were played shimmeringly well. As well
it should: It was the 1,215th time Bernstein conducted the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 14, 1943, Bernstein, the Philharmonic's then-assistant
conductor, filled for an ailing Bruno Walter on such short notice
there was no rehearsal. The concert was broadcast nationally on
radio. And there was such acclaim that Bernstein, who had never led
the orchestra in concert until that day, was catapulted to fame, at
age 25.
</P>
<P>
At intermission, Mrs. Artur Rodzinski, whose late husband was the
Philharmonic music's director in 1943 and hired Bernstein as his
assistant, was introduced from a box.
</P>
<P>
Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in the Philharmonic that
Sunday, is still a member and was playing on Monday night. Eight
others who also were members in 1943 _ violinist Louis Fishzohn,
oboist Albert Goltzer, timpanist Saul Goodman, bassist Homer Mensch,
cellist Martin Ormandy, assistant concertmaster Michael Rosenker,
and trumpeters James Smith and William Vacchiano _ went on stage.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein gave bear hugs to all nine.
``I feel older than all of them,'' said Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was given a silver box engraved with a reproduction of
Monday evening's program cover _ a caricature of him, with jutting
chin, bright eye, flowing hair and baton, and reading ``with love
and thanks of the Philharmonic family to Lennie.''
``Will this birthday never end?,'' he told the audience.
</P>
<P>
Monday's concert began with Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms,''
with the splendid Westminster Symphonic Choir. Todd Caruso, a member
of the American Boychoir whose voice is high, pure and moving, sang
the solo part.
</P>
<P>
Violinist Gidon Kremer, a native of the Latvian town of Riga in
the Soviet Union, was soloist in ``Serenade for Violin, String
Orchestra, Harp and Percussion.'' Kremer's sound isn't warm but his
technique is breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
Pianist Krystian Zimerman, who was born in Zabrze, Poland, often
performs with Bernstein in Europe. He was the respectful and
thoroughly engaged soloist in the final work on the program,
Bernstein's ``Symphony No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra,'' subtitled
``The Age of Anxiety'' after W.H. Auden's poem.
</P>
<P>
All the performers donated their services, with proceeds
benefiting the Philharmonic's efforts on behalf of American
conductors.

71-Year-Old Conductor Cancels Performances, Cites Exhaustion
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conductor Leonard Bernstein has canceled several
performances in Japan due to exhaustion and lingering illness and
will return to the United States to recover, his manager announced
today.
``Leonard Bernstein is suffering from exhaustion as a result of
trying to fulfill his professional obligations while not having
fully recovered from several ailments he suffered this spring.
</P>
<P>
Complete rest for an extended period is required if this remarkable
man is to regain his usual high energy level,'' said Dr. Kevin
Cahill, the conductor's personal physician.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, 71, has suffered from severe influenza, pleurisy, and
pneumonia since the beginning of the year, Cahill said in a
statement released by Harry Kraut, Bernstein's manager.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Angelo Aquista, an associate of Cahill, flew to Japan to
accompany the conductor back to New York, it said. Kraut did not
provide the time or date of Bernstein's departure.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein had been scheduled to conduct the London Symphony
Orchestra in four performances in Japan, ending with a concert on
July 22.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein issued a separate statement apologizing to his fans
and sponsors and saying that he had asked LSO principal conductor
Michael Tilson Thomas and Japanese conductor Eiji Oue to fulfill
his conducting responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday and Sunday, Bernstein canceled appearances with an
orchestra of young musicians from the Pacific-Asia region who had
been training under principals of the LSO during the three-week
Pacific Music Festival in northern Japan.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein inaugurated the festival last month. He started the
event along the lines of the Tanglewood music festival in
Massachusetts, where young musicians train with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
The Japan festival is believed to be the first festival in Asia
where young musicians can train with a professional orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Kraut's statement said it was not known whether Bernstein would
be able to conduct next month at the Tanglewood festival or during
the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra Tour in Europe later this
summer.

Leonard Bernstein Giving Up Conducting
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conductor Leonard Bernstein, the ``West Side
Story'' composer who mesmerized audiences with his passion and
physical flair at the podium, is giving up the baton because of
poor health.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old maestro suffers from a lung tumor, emphysema and
pulmonary infections and has been told by his doctor to stop
conducting and performing on the piano, his spokeswoman said
Tuesday.
``Leonard Bernstein will henceforth devote his professional
energies to composing, writing and education,'' said Margaret
Carson.
</P>
<P>
He last conducted Aug. 19 at the Tanglewood Music Center in
western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's announcement was met with dismay in the music world,
especially at the New York Philharmonic, which he directed from
1958 to 1969. ``I receive this unfortunate news in utter shock,''
said Zubin Mehta, music director.
</P>
<P>
Albert K. Webster, managing director of the Philharmonic, said:
``Leonard Bernstein has BEEN the New York Philharmonic for more
than 45 years. We all will be less for the loss of his magic
baton.''
Bernstein still hopes to participate in an AIDS benefit at
Carnegie Hall on Oct. 28 but canceled all appearances with
orchestras in New York, Israel, Vienna and London and with festival
orchestras at Tanglewood, Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, known for his vigorous style at the podium, once led
an orchestra performance at a liberated concentration camp. Last
Christmas, he celebrated the tumbling of the Berlin Wall by
conducting Beethoven's ``Ninth Symphony.''
In May, he canceled plans to conduct opening night of the
Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., citing ``a near brush with
pneumonia.''
Carson said Bernstein has had increased difficulty breathing in
past weeks. Dr. Kevin M. Cahill attributed the problem to emphysema
complicated by a tumor and pulmonary infections. Bernstein was once
a heavy smoker.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein is not hospitalized. Carson said the conductor was
told that rest offers the best hope for returning to limited
activities.
</P>
<P>
She said Bernstein plans to continue work on a new chamber music
piece to be performed next spring, a new musical theater work he
hopes to finish by summer and several educational, film and
recording projects, as well as his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was the wunderkind of American music at a time when
all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
His first published composition was ``The Clarinet Sonata'' in
1942. He conducted his first symphony, the ``Jeremiah,'' with the
Pittsburgh Symphony in 1944. That year his ballet, ``Fancy Free,''
choreographed by Jerome Robbins, opened and became the basis for
the Broadway musical ``On the Town.''
After Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor Serge Koussevitzky
died in 1951, Bernstein became head of the orchestra and conducting
departments at Tanglewood. His first opera, ``Trouble in Tahiti,''
was performed in 1952. He composed ``Candide'' in 1956 and ``West
Side Story'' in 1957.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, he retired from the post to concentrate on composing
and was appointed the Philharmonic's laureate conductor for life.
</P>
<P>
He has conducted 1,244 New York Philharmonic concerts, more than
any other conductor.

Leonard Bernstei Buried In Brooklyn

<TEXT>
<P>
Leonard Bernstein, whose wide-ranging talents
and flamboyant personality helped make him the first American
maestro to conquer music's international podium, was buried today
alongside his wife.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, who died of lung failure Sunday at age 72, was buried
this afternoon in private ceremonies at Greenwood Cemetery in
Brooklyn. His wife, Felicia Montealegre, died in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Flags at Lincoln Center, where the New York Philharmonic
performs, were lowered in memory of the orchestra's first
American-born music director. Bernstein was appointed in 1958 and
stepped down in 1969 to spend more time composing.
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic will perform an all-Bernstein program beginning
Thursday and continuing through Oct. 23. The schedule had called
for works by Shostakovich and Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
A memorial concert also is planned for Carnegie Hall on Nov. 14,
the 47th anniversary of Bernstein's Philharmonic debut.
</P>
<P>
Famed for his gymnastics at the podium, Bernstein composed
symphonies as well as movie scores and Broadway shows such as
``West Side Story,'' ``On the Town'' and ``Candide.''
His Emmy-winning ``Young People's Concerts'' on television
introduced thousands to classical music.
``He was the most unique musician of this century, there is no
doubt about it,'' said Zubin Mehta, music director of the New York
Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Larry Kert, who played Tony in the Broadway production of ``West
Side Story,'' said Bernstein himself played the piano for him
during rehearsals.
``He could have gotten a rehearsal pianist, but he cared too
much,'' Kert said. ``I was the new kid on the block and he stroked
me and took care of me - and I will never forget him for that.''

Bernstein's Philharmonic Lets His Music Speak for Them
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the New York Philharmonic, it was supposed
to be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich. The fates made it a
night of Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
The official catalog of his works says Bernstein led 74
orchestras. But this was HIS orchestra, and the musicians came to
pay tribute to THEIR laureate conductor, who led them through 1,244
concerts during his 47-year association with the Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
They let his music do the talking.
``Tonight's concert is not an evening in which we want to dwell
on the passing of a giant, but rather what he has left us,'' guest
conductor Leonard Slatkin told the audience at Avery Fisher Hall on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
So four nights after Bernstein's death at age 72, Beethoven's
``Violin Concerto'' became Bernstein's ``Serenade for Solo Violin,
String Orchestra, Harp and Percussion'' (1954); Shostakovich's
``Symphony No. 4'' became Bernstein's ``Symphony No. 1
(Jeremiah),'' written in 1942.
</P>
<P>
Also added were his ``Chichester Psalms'' (1965) and his
overture to ``Candide'' (1956). The substitute Bernstein program
was being repeated Friday night, Saturday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was an extraordinary concert.
</P>
<P>
There weren't many smiling faces among the audience or
musicians. Slatkin's brief introductory comments, followed by the
whimsical ``Candide,'' broke some of the tension.
</P>
<P>
Then came the eclectic ``Serenade,'' which Bernstein's program
notes says is supposed to be based on Plato's ``Symposium.'' It
begins with a lyrical praise of the Eros, the god of love. The
piece is sometimes jocular, sometimes melancholy, sometimes
assaulting and sometimes hedonistic. It ends in drunken revelry, an
intrusion of jazz - as if Bernstein was looking down from heaven
and telling the audience, ``It's O.K. to smile tonight.''
The soloist - concertmaster Glenn Dicterow - played with much
agility, especially through the difficult double stops and
especially considering the lack of preparation time.
</P>
<P>
The mourning returned after intermission, but not without
optimism.
``Jeremiah'' begins with suspenseful strings, followed by a
cantorial French horn, a melodic return to the strings and then a
prophetic blaring of brass. The second movement continues the
point-counterpoint of brass versus strings (Jeremiah versus the
corrupt priests, with Nebuchadnezzar looming on the horizon). In
the third movement, Jerusalem has fallen to the Babylonian king.
</P>
<P>
Judea is exiled. Jeremiah weeps.
``How she sits desolate -
``The city once so full of people -
``She is become as a widow.''
During her chanting of the prophet's ``Lamentations,''
mezzo-soprano Wendy White had to wipe a tear from her eye. S did
members of the audience.
</P>
<P>
Last on the program was another Hebraic elegy, ``Chichester
Psalms.'' The New York Choral Artists and a boy soloist joined the
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Two harpists dominated the center of the crowded stage.
``Awake, psaltery and harp!'' the choir begins in Hebrew.
``I will rouse the dawn.''
In the second movement an angelic 8th-grader, Evan Weber, sings
King David's 23rd Psalm, ``The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
want.''
After he finishes, the men's chorus bellows: ``Why do the
nations rage?''
The piece, however, ends in a Mahlerian motif and chorus
declaring a message Bernstein had sought for society:
``Behold how good,
``And how pleasant it is,
``For brethren to dwell
``Together in unity.''
To emphasize the point after the final note, Slatkin suspended
his hands for several long moments of silence. Then came the
cascade of applause. For Leonard Bernstein.

Bernstein Remembered at Concert on His Magical Day
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his
sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago,
the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included
selections from his ``Mass'' and ``Chichester Psalms.''
Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie Hall also came on the
90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend, Aaron
Copland. And it was the 36th anniversary of the first TV broadcast
by Bernstein, who died Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
Speakers, introducing various selections and often quoting from
Bernstein's writings, included Bernstein's three children,
son-in-law and friends Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's daughter Jamie Thomas said her father had loved
numerical coincidences ``and today there's a flock of them.''
The concert began with selections from Bernstein's ``Mass,''
which he composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center for
Performing Arts in Washington, and ended with Psalm 133, in Hebrew,
from Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms.''
Conductors were Michael Tilson Thomas, Michael Barrett,
Christoph Eschenbach and James Levine. The orchestra played the
overture to Bernstein's ``Candide'' with a symbolically empty
podium, which brought tears to some of the invited audience and a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played a Bach sarabande. Singers
were the Westminster Choir, mezzo-sopranos Marilyn Horne and
Christa Ludwig, soprano Clamma Dale, tenor Jerry Hadley and
baritones Thomas Hampson and Chester Ludgin.
</P>
<P>
First chair musicians from the Boston Symphony, Israel
Philharmonic, London Symphony, Santa Cecilia Orchestra and Vienna
Philharmonic flew here, at their orchestras' expense, to take part.
</P>
<P>
Two pieces by Copland were played. The concert also included
Schumann, Haydn and Mahler as well as excerpts from six Bernstein
works.
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was the New York Philharmonic's 25-year-old assistant
conductor on Nov. 14, 1943, when he filled in at the last minute
for an ailing Bruno Walter.

LEONARD BERNSTEIN DIES; CONDUCTOR, COMPOSER; 
MUSIC: RENAISSANCE MAN OF HIS ART WAS 72. THE LONGTIME LEADER OF THE N.Y. 
PHILHARMONIC CARVED A NICHE IN HISTORY WITH 'WEST SIDE STORY.' 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, 
composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of 
his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, known and beloved by the world as "Lenny," died at 6:15 p.m. in the 
presence of his son, Alexander, and physician, Kevin M. Cahill, who said the 
cause of death was complications of progressive lung failure. On Cahill's 
advice, the conductor had announced Tuesday that he would retire. Cahill said 
progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung 
infections had left Bernstein too weak to continue working. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Bernstein canceled performances with increasing frequency. 
His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood, Mass., on Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony 
orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, 
while conducting from the piano. 
</P>
<P>
He etched other niches in history by composing the indelible "West Side Story" 
and teaching a generation about classical music via the innovative television 
series "Omnibus." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish 
they possessed in merely one, Bernstein still might have remained an obscure 
musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as 
well as professional life. With it, he became a personality, well known even to 
people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
The dervish persona, including his upstart gymnastics on the podium, never 
lessened throughout his long life in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
He made classical music understandable and palatable to the masses. And he 
lifted popular music to a higher plane, infusing performers and listeners with 
his manic joy in creating tonal sound. 
</P>
<P>
"Some conductors mellow with age," commented Times music critic Martin 
Bernheimer when Bernstein conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic at UCLA in 
1986. "(But) Bernstein, at 68, remains a frenetic combination of orbiting 
rocket, aerobics master, super-juggler, matinee idol, booming cannon, 
hysterical mime, heart-rending tragedian, bouncing ball, sky writer, riveting 
machine, mawkish sentimentalist and danseur ignoble." 
</P>
<P>
Describing the conductor in the same concert, Bernheimer referred to him as 
"the shrugging, jumping, sighing, soaring, gushing, crouching, rocking, 
rolling, bounding, bobbing, leaping, jiggling, stabbing, hunching, bumping, 
grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis." 
</P>
<P>
Critics also were quick to agree that had his envied and often-criticized 
showmanship masked lazy, sloppy or inept musicianship, Bernstein could never 
have remained an internationally sought-after conductor for five decades. He 
knew what he was doing, and the musicians he accompanied, wrote for, conducted, 
or lectured to and taught admired him as one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Bernstein (so-named because his maternal grandmother insisted) was born 
Aug. 25, 1918, in Lawrence, Mass., to two Russian Jewish immigrants. His 
father, Samuel Joseph Bernstein, was an entrepreneur of women's hair care 
products and a Talmudic scholar. His mother, Jennie Resnick Bernstein, who 
survives him, said her son always had an ear for music. "When he was 4 or 5, he 
would play an imaginary piano on his windowsill." 
</P>
<P>
The parents preferred the name "Leonard" and called the boy that. When his 
kindergarten teacher asked "Louis Bernstein" to stand up, he remained seated 
and looked around the room to see who shared his last name. Bernstein changed 
his name legally at age 16, when he got his first driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
His mega musical talent emerged belatedly and almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
When Bernstein was 10, a divorcing aunt stored her old upright piano with his 
parents, and the boy who used to play at the windowsill became fascinated with 
it. He asked for lessons, and soon was playing better than his teacher, a 
neighbor's daughter who charged $1 a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
By age 12, he was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and had 
determined, despite his father's objections, that music - at that point 
playing the piano - would be his career. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's stunning instinctive talents for sight-reading, remembering 
complicated scores, and improvisation became evident as he played, and altered, 
classical, jazz and popular music. He produced his own shows and versions of 
"The Mikado" and "Carmen," and performed as piano soloist with his school 
orchestra and the State Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
He reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects 
taught at the 300-year-old Boston Latin School. 
</P>
<P>
At Harvard University, Bernstein studied piano and composition, but developed a 
serious interest in composing only after meeting American composer Aaron 
Copland. 
</P>
<P>
A fan and practitioner of his music, Bernstein met Copland in a typical 
it-could-only-happen-to-Lenny incident. Invited to a dance recital in New York, 
Bernstein sat in the balcony next to a man he did not recognize. Invited 
afterward to a post-recital birthday party for Copland, Bernstein commandeered 
the piano and played Copland's "Piano Variations." His performance captivated 
the man he had met in the balcony, who of course was Copland. 
</P>
<P>
They became lifelong friends. Copland introduced Bernstein to several composers 
and got him his first job - transcribing music for the publisher Boosey and 
Hawkes. Ironically, Copland subsequently urged the torn Bernstein to make 
conducting, rather than composing or even piano playing, his career. 
</P>
<P>
Conducting emerged as a possibility to Bernstein that same year - 1937, his 
sophomore year at Harvard - when he met the Greek conductor Dimitri 
Mitropoulos during the maestro's visit to campus. Mitropoulos was so impressed 
with Bernstein's playing that he invited him to attend rehearsals with the 
Boston Symphony. The maestro also talked with Bernstein privately in his 
dressing room after concerts, promising to keep in touch. 
</P>
<P>
"The influence of Mitropoulos on my life, on my conducting life is enormous and 
usually greatly underrated or not known at all," Bernstein wrote years later, 
after his mentors had all died, "because ordinarily the two great conductors 
with whom I studied are the ones who receive the credit for whatever conducting 
prowess I have, namely Serge Koussevitzky and Fritz Reiner. . . . But long 
before I met either of them, I had met Dimitri Mitropoulos . . . and watching 
him conduct those two weeks of rehearsals and concerts with the Boston Symphony 
laid some kind of conductorial passion and groundwork in my psyche which I 
wasn't even aware of until many years later." 
</P>
<P>
Graduated from Harvard and out of work after a summer in New York, Bernstein 
asked Mitropoulos what he should do. 
</P>
<P>
"You must be a conductor," Mitropoulos replied, urging him to study at 
Juilliard or with Reiner at Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. It was fall and 
conducting classes at Juilliard were full, so Bernstein went to Philadelphia 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
During the summers he studied under Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston 
Symphony, at the new school Koussevitzky was starting at the orchestra's summer 
home, Tanglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"He became like a surrogate father to me," Bernstein later said of 
Koussevitzky, his third major conducting mentor. "He had no children of his own 
and I had a father whom I loved very much but who was not for this musical 
thing at all. . . . And so I found another father: first Mitropoulos, then 
Reiner, and now Koussevitzky. But the Koussevitzky relationship was very 
special, very warm." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein later became Koussevitzky's assistant and returned to Tanglewood 
annually to conduct and teach. He so revered the maestro that he was married in 
Koussevitzky's shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff 
links. 
</P>
<P>
It was Koussevitzky - and fate - who arranged Bernstein's meteoric ascension 
to world-class conductor at the unheard-of age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
On his 25th birthday, Aug. 25, 1943, Bernstein was told by the Koussevitzkys 
that he should visit Artur Rodzinsky, newly appointed music director of the New 
York Philharmonic, at his Stockbridge, Conn., farm. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to need an assistant conductor," Rodzinsky told him. "I have gone 
through all the conductors I know of in my mind and I finally asked God whom I 
shall take and God said, 'Take Bernstein,' " he said, granting the position as 
a favor not to God but to Koussevitzky. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkable as his appointment was considering that he was an American and so 
young, Bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium. In the 
orchestra's history, no assistant conductor had ever been called on. 
</P>
<P>
But for "Lucky Lenny" history made an exception. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 14, less than three months after Bernstein got the job, guest conductor 
Bruno Walter fell ill and Rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm. 
</P>
<P>
Jennie Tourel had sung Bernstein's "I Hate Music" at her Town Hall debut the 
previous night, in itself an event big enough to bring his parents to town, and 
he had played for her and the post-recital party. 
</P>
<P>
With no rehearsal, a hangover and three hours sleep, Bernstein was to conduct a 
complex program broadcast nationwide on CBS radio. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times chronicled the epic event on Page One and stated in an 
editorial: "Mr. Bernstein had to have something approaching genius to make full 
use of his opportunity. . . . It's a good American success story. The warm, 
friendly triumph of it filled Carnegie Hall and spread over the airwaves." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was not to get his own orchestra until he took over the New York 
Philharmonic in 1957-58. He had no time for one. He was too much in demand 
around the world as the wunderkind guest conductor. 
</P>
<P>
Successful as a pianist, composer and conductor, Bernstein, according to Joan 
Peyser in a controversial biography, consulted psychiatrists because of his 
internal conflict over the three pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for me to make an exclusive choice among the various 
activities," Bernstein wrote in 1946. "What seems right for me at any given 
moment is what I must do. . . . The ends are music itself . . . and the means 
are my private problem." 
</P>
<P>
The piano became an occasional solo onstage or a celebrated party pastime. 
Bernstein concentrated seriously on composing while developing and 
commercializing his conducting career. 
</P>
<P>
His first major composition, a symphony titled "Jeremiah," was introduced in 
1942, and his first ballet, "Fancy Free," and related first musical, "On the 
Town," both debuted in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
He sought to be a classical composer, winning plaudits for symphonies 
("Jeremiah" was followed by "The Age of Anxiety" in 1949 and "Kaddish" in 
1963), sonatas, and the operas "Trouble in Tahiti" in 1953 and "A Quiet Place" 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In writing music, Bernstein achieved greater success on Broadway, and even in 
Hollywood, than in Lincoln Center. He followed "On the Town" with the musicals 
"Wonderful Town" in 1953, the score for the film "On the Waterfront" in 1954, 
and the critically acclaimed but less popular "Candide" in 1956. His best and 
best-remembered work, "West Side Story," debuted in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can write one real, moving American opera that any American can 
understand (and one that is, notwithstanding, a serious musical work), I shall 
be a happy man," Bernstein said in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
When many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with "West 
Side Story," he disagreed, saying: "There are moments when I think so, but as a 
sum total it fails to be an opera. Because at the denouement, at the dramatic 
unraveling, the music stops. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't love it any less," he added, reveling in the adulation his 
adaptation of the Romeo and Juliet conflict had produced. "It doesn't make it a 
stepchild or a foundling." 
</P>
<P>
In teaching, his fourth area of expertise, Bernstein taught regularly at 
Tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his Charles Eliot Norton 
Lectures on tonality at Harvard in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
It was on television in the 1950s and 1960s, with his "Young People's Concerts" 
of the Philharmonic and "Omnibus," that Bernstein taught the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"An assessment of Bernstein must include his talent and contribution as a 
teacher and popularizer of music, a role that has set him apart most from other 
performers," conductor, historian and Bard College President Leon Botstein 
wrote in Harper's in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Instinctively adept at television, Bernstein became a prototype for Carl Sagan, 
Alistair Cooke and others now familiar on instructive programs on the Public 
Broadcasting System. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's programs, Botstein said, "displayed his gift for analyzing and 
enthusing about classical music without sacrificing the integrity of the score, 
its complexity, or its simple genius. No one before or since Bernstein has been 
so effective - artistically and commercially - in proselytizing and bringing 
alive serious music to a mass audience." 
</P>
<P>
The television classics won Bernstein a coveted Peabody award. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was able to apply his innate ability for commercializing his art that 
had made him wealthy to the struggling New York Philharmonic. He introduced 
free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television, widening its 
audience and tripling paid concert attendance. 
</P>
<P>
He left the orchestra in 1969, after a record 11-year tenure at the helm, to 
have more time for composing and guest conducting. 
</P>
<P>
If two rings of the Bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music, the 
third was anchored in his uproarious personal life. Known for his emotional 
embraces of both sexes, Bernstein loved crowds and kept friends and family with 
him throughout the night at his Manhattan apartment or Connecticut country 
home. 
</P>
<P>
A heavy smoker and drinker who partied or worked until dawn and slept until 
noon, he claimed he composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people. 
</P>
<P>
"God knows, I should be dead by now," he said as he approached 70, 
characteristically cavalier about his health. "I smoke. I drink. I stay up all 
night. I'm overcommitted on all fronts. . . . I was told that if I didn't stop 
smoking I'd be dead at 35. Well, I beat the rap." 
</P>
<P>
Raising the high-brow music world's eyebrows, Bernstein campaigned with other 
celebrities for the civil rights of blacks in the 1960s and against the Vietnam 
War in the 1970s. Criticized for "radical chic," his leftist political 
philosophy prompted him to host a storied fund-raising party for the Black 
Panthers in 1970. In 1989, he rejected a National Medal of the Arts in protest 
of the withdrawn $10,000 grant (later reinstated) of the National Endowment for 
the Arts to an art show on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Although Peyser made a strong case in her 1987 biography that Bernstein had 
many homosexual affairs (Bernstein promised his children never to read the 
book), there was no question that he adored his family. On Sept. 9, 1951, he 
married Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, and, despite a short separation 
and subsequent reconciliation in 1976, remained devoted to her and went into a 
severe depression when she died of lung cancer in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein is also survived by two daughters, Jamie and Nina, as well as his 
sister, Shirley, and brother, Burton. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Margaret Carson said the funeral would be private. 
</P>
<P>
Staunchly opposed to retiring, until last Tuesday, Bernstein continued his 
guest conducting, composing, and recording, perhaps topping his more than 200 
records with the best of his best, a re-recording of "West Side Story" in 1985. 
The effort became Deutsche Grammaphon's all-time best-selling record and 
prompted Will Crutchfield to write in the New York Times that Bernstein was in 
a class with Giuseppe Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand saluted "West Side Story" anew in 1986 
when he made Bernstein a commander of the Legion of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
After a nationwide series of concerts and parties celebrating his 70th birthday 
in 1988, Bernstein said with uncharacteristic modesty: "I have no further 
requests of the fates . . . except for time. I've achieved more than I had any 
right to expect. Nobody has been as lucky as I have."

HOME TECH: MORE LEONARD BERNSTEIN RELEASES SET; 
MUSIC: SONY AND DEUTSCHE GRAMMOPHON PLAN EXPANDED RELEASE SCHEDULES OF 
RECORDINGS BY THE LATE CONDUCTOR. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in 
history, will undergo expanded release programs following the conductor's death 
on Sunday, said representatives of the recording companies controlling the late 
Bernstein's catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon, which control the bulk of 
Bernstein's recorded legacy, and BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal plan to step up 
timetables to deliver more Bernstein recordings to the marketplace. However, 
most of the repertory will be from previously released recordings, including 
some made early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only new recordings will be out next month - as originally 
scheduled, reported Karen Moody, vice president of Deutsche Grammophon. These 
are recent recordings Bernstein made with the New York Philharmonic 
(Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony), the Vienna Philharmonic (two Mozart symphonies 
and the clarinet concerto) and Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam (Schubert's 
Symphonies Nos. 5 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, 
director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin 
its three-year release of "The Bernstein Collection": "We will release 75 CDs 
of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and 
others, but also oratorio performances - works by Haydn, and the Requiems by 
Berlioz and Verdi - and other music never before released on CD." 
</P>
<P>
At Deutsche Grammophon, also in New York, Wende Persons, director of promotion, 
reported: "We are looking at (Bernstein's) active DG discography, which 
contains over 100 different recordings, and making sure everything is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"That's 120 titles (of standard classical repertory) and some of Bernstein's 
own (non-theatrical) music, plus another dozen videos." In his last years, 
Bernstein recorded exclusively for DG. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Deutsche Grammophon released in this country a 12-CD set of 
Bernstein recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic and L.A. 
Philharmonic. These recordings were made between 1977 and 1985 of music by 
Beethoven, Brahms, Bernstein, Haydn, Mozart, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and 
Gershwin. Called "The Bernstein Edition," it is being sold concurrently in 
Europe in a 25-CD set. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Moody, vice president of the classical label, would not reveal sales 
figures for "The Bernstein Edition," but said: "I can say that it is selling 
very well in this country, surprisingly well, given the U.S. market aversion to 
CD sets." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Carol Brown, West Coast manager of sales and marketing for BMG 
Classics/RCA Red Seal, told The Times on Thursday that her label now plans a 
March release of recordings by Bernstein conducting the RCA Symphony in 
Copland's "Billy the Kid" and a suite from Bernstein's "On the Town," 
recordings made in the 1940s, and representing the conductor/composer's first 
commercial recordings. 
</P>
<P>
BMG also plans, according to spokesman Carl Pritzkat, the spring release of an 
early Bernstein recording as pianist - in which he plays Copland's Piano 
Variations - as well as other recorded documents of the young 
composer/pianist. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Bernstein catalogue encompasses well over 200 classical recordings 
and occupies more than a full page in the Schwann catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
There is very little available on Bernstein in the home-video market, which is 
no surprise considering there are so few classical music titles on cassette. 
Three tapes of programs recorded in 1971, all on Phoenix/BFA Films and Video, 
are out: 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein on Beethoven: a Tribute," featuring Bernstein playing sections of 
Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major. 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein on Beethoven: Fidelio," with rehearsal and concert footage of 
Bernstein working with the Vienna State Opera Company. 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein on Beethoven: Ode to Joy From the Ninth Symphony," featuring the 
Vienna State Opera Chorus and the Vienna Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Three movies whose scores he composed are also on home video: 
</P>
<P>
* MGM/UA's "On the Town" (1949), co-starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The 
lyrics are by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. 
</P>
<P>
* MGM/UA's "West Side Story" (1961), featuring Stephen Sondheim's lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
* RCA/Columbia's "On the Waterfront" (1954), the Oscar-winner for best picture.

LEONARD BERNSTEIN REMEMBRANCES; 
MUSIC: MORE LOCAL TRIBUTES FOR THE CONDUCTOR-COMPOSER ARE PLANNED ON SUNDAY. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In addition to the Leonard Bernstein tribute that is part of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic program this weekend, other local orchestras are also planning 
special remembrances. Sunday at Royce Hall, the American Youth Symphony has 
added local composer Leon Levitch's Elegy for Strings - a personal choice from 
conductor Mehli Mehta - to the program to honor Bernstein, who died last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Also, opening the new season of the Glendale Symphony season on Sunday at 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, music director Lalo Schifrin will observe a moment 
of silence to honor his longtime friend and colleague. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, KUSC-FM (91.5) devoted its entire day of live broadcasting, from 6 
a.m. to 10 p.m., to performances - as conductor and pianist - and 
compositions of Bernstein, including an unusual recording from 1956 of him 
discussing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
KKGO-FM (105.1) also devoted a considerable amount air time to Bernstein's work 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure of grief came from the obituary section of the New York Times, 
which includes a section of special classified ads for public condolences at 
$15.85 a line. The outpouring of emotions following Bernstein's death filled 
almost 200 lines (15 inches of small type) and encompassed 14 separate 
tributes. Among the contributors were conductors Zubin Mehta and Kurt Masur, as 
well as Peter Martins of the New York Ballet and Christopher Keene of the New 
York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard Bernstein . . . is now being mourned by the entire world. I personally 
have lost a dear friend." wrote Mehta in his tribute. "I was proud to be 
associated with him at the New York Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic 
Orchestra, both of which he considered family." 
</P>
<P>
"This is perhaps not unusual for a prominent member of the Jewish community 
involved with philanthropic activities," reported Irv Horowitz, the New York 
Times obituary editor. He said the biggest similar reaction he could recall 
came after the recent death of the mother of the New York Times publisher. 
"That was considerably larger," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bernstein family has requested contributions in lieu of flowers be made to 
the Bernstein Education Through the Arts Fund Inc., 25 C.P.W., Suite 1B, New 
York, N.Y. 10023.

CONDUCTOR BERNSTEIN 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I assume that anyone who was ever touched by the genius of Leonard Bernstein 
will have his own memory of the Renaissance man of music, as you aptly 
described him (Part A, Oct. 15). 
</P>
<P>
Mine dates back to October, 1948, when I was serving as an American volunteer 
in the Israeli army during the country's War of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
With a two-day pass in hand, I hitchhiked to Jerusalem, where the Israeli 
equivalent of the USO scrounged up a ticket for the evening's performance of 
the Israel Philharmonic, with Bernstein as the guest conductor. 
</P>
<P>
The audience was a mix of black-tie patrons and soldiers dressed in fatigues. 
Bernstein raised the baton for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, emotional at any 
time, but never more so than for a people engaged in a life-and-death struggle. 
Toward the end of the first movement, machine-gun fire started crackling from 
the old city, held by the Jordanian Legion, and continued intermittently 
through the rest of the symphony. What would have been a distracting 
disturbance at any other time, melded, with the music as entirely appropriate 
to the mood and circumstances of the occasion. Lenny and the orchestra, never 
missed a beat.

A BROADWAY GOODBY TO BERNSTEIN; 
MEMORIAL: LONGTIME FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES LAUGH, CRY, SING AT NEW YORK'S 
MAJESTIC THEATER. 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laughter and tears flowed freely as the Broadway theatrical community said 
goodby Thursday to Leonard Bernstein at the Majestic Theater. Longtime friends 
and colleagues - those who knew him as Lenny - paid tribute to the 
musical-theater dynamo with heartfelt and humorous words, and often in song. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity audience - invited friends, relatives and theatrical 
personalities as well as 850 members of the public who started lining up at 7 
a.m. - heard recollections of an energetic Bernstein who danced until dawn in 
discos as well as a poignant account of his final days. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for "West Side Story," hosted the 75-minute 
tribute to Bernstein, 72, who died Oct. 14. "Wherever Lenny was, was theater; 
his every move was a stage direction," he said, as many in the audience laughed 
knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
Another "West Side Story" collaborator, director-choreographer Jerome Robbins, 
had earned a laugh before he even spoke, thanks to Laurents' introductory 
words: "Fearless as Lenny was, there were two figures he did fear - God and 
Jerome Robbins." 
</P>
<P>
After noting that he wished he were young enough to pay homage to Bernstein by 
performing the sailor's variation he created in the ballet "Fancy Free," 
Robbins, 72, recalled that halcyon 1944 collaboration between the two 
25-year-olds. He also reflected on the joyous nature of their 1957 "West Side 
Story" collaboration, even while the show faced repeated obstacles before 
reaching Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny's music was the lifeblood of that show. His theater scores weren't just 
a collection of songs but were more like a symphonic work," noted Robbins, who 
also collaborated on several other ballet and theater works with Bernstein. He 
concluded in subdued tones, "We have lost a maker and shaker of our century. A 
light went out for me." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Lawrence, the original Maria of "West Side Story," sang a medley of "I 
Feel Pretty" and "Tonight." The "West Side Story" reunion was not as complete 
as had been scheduled; Larry Kert was unable to be there, and Stephen Sondheim 
(who, then a newcomer to Broadway, wrote the lyrics) could not attend due to 
illness in his family. 
</P>
<P>
Original cast members from Bernstein shows sang numbers they had helped launch 
into history. Nancy Walker sang her sassy "I Can Cook Too" from "On the Town." 
Her fellow cast members, Betty Comden and Adolph Green (who also teamed with 
Bernstein as the show's creators), after fondly recalling their 50-year 
friendship with Bernstein, poignantly sang the show's bittersweet finale, "Some 
Other Time." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Cook, the original Cunegonde in Bernstein's "Candide" (1956), displayed 
her still-gleaming voice in "A Simple Song" from Bernstein's 1971 "Mass." 
"Candide" itself was represented by "Glitter and Be Gay," the coloratura aria 
Cook made famous, as performed by Constance Haumann. 
</P>
<P>
Winging in from the West Coast (as was Walker) was Lauren Bacall, who teamed up 
with Phyllis Newman for a sly rendition of "Ohio" from Bernstein's "Wonderful 
Town." Kurt Ollmann, familiar from Bernstein's 1985 "West Side Story" 
recording, sang "Take Care of This House" from Bernstein's last (1976), 
unsuccessful, Broadway show, "1600 Pennsylvania Ave." - a work the composer 
often spoke of wanting to revise.

Bernstein's son, Alexander, delivered a funny, knowing, affectionate talk about 
his father's unappreciated skills as an actor, singer and dancer as only a 
family member could know them. Michael Wager, a very close friend of 
Bernstein's who was with him at the end, spoke movingly of how difficult it was 
for Bernstein to continue when illness had robbed him of his creative energy.

Marilyn Horne closed the program with "Somewhere," the emotional anthem from 
"West Side Story," after which Laurents directed the audience's attention to 
the large photo that hung over the stage: an exuberant 39-year-old Bernstein, 
nearly levitating outside the theater where "West Side Story" had opened in 
Washington.

Since "Lenny didn't like silence," Laurents asked instead for a final round of 
applause for the man who inspired and moved so many people for so many years. 
The audience responded with a sustained standing ovation.
