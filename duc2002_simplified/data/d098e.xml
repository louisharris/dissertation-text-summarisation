NASA, Scientists Eagerly Await Second Launch Attempt
</HL>

<P>
Two weeks after a failed launch
attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the
most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space
Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.
</P>
<P>
The countdown began Saturday afternoon for a launch set for 8:31
a.m. EDT Tuesday. If the launch goes on schedule and all else goes
well, the first picture from Hubble could be available next weekend.
``We are as excited, maybe even more. You can cut it with a
knife, incredible,'' said Eric Chaisson, senior scientist at the
Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a
result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the
mission since its original 1983 launch date.
</P>
<P>
As Chaisson remarked last week: ``The universe has been around
for 15 billion years. A couple of weeks is not going to matter.''
``The heavens look the same to me. The secrets are the same,''
Chaisson said.
``There's not a bit of difference,'' agreed Charles Pellerin
Jr., NASA's director of astrophysics. ``I think the main point is
the Hubble Space Telescope still is in perfect condition.''
The $1.5 billion telescope, the most expensive unmanned
spacecraft ever built, rests safely inside Discovery's payload bay
awaiting the Tuesday launch.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Discovery will return to Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., on Sunday, April 29, with an empty payload bay. NASA
said it may release its first telescope image from Hubble _ of an
open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ as early as that
same day.
</P>
<P>
After the early test images are made and other preparatory work
is done, Hubble is expected to start providing significant
scientific data by satellite in a month or two.
</P>
<P>
The observatory is considered the greatest advance in astronomy
since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609. It also is considered
by many at NASA to be the most important shuttle mission to date;
it will be the 35th.
</P>
<P>
The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
who discovered during the 1920s the universe constantly is
expanding. His work gave rise to the theory the universe was
created by a tremendous explosion about 15 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
From its perch far above Earth's obstructing atmosphere, the
telescope will be able to discern objects 50 times fainter and with
10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers are counting on Hubble to unravel some of the
mystery surrounding quasars, pulsars and black holes. By studying
stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to
Earth for 14 billion years, they hope to determine the precise
origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems _ and
life forms _ exist.
``If everything goes well, it's going to knock our socks off,''
Chaisson said.
</P>
<P>
NASA's sole attempt to launch Discovery was halted four minutes
before liftoff April 10 when one of the shuttle's three auxiliary
power units failed. The 88-pound unit was replaced with a new one,
the first time NASA ever had installed such a unit at the launch
pad.
</P>
<P>
The procedure went so smoothly the space agency decided last
week to advance the launch to Tuesday, a day earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries were returned to the
telescope Friday following 130 hours of recharging. The batteries
will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's
power system until its energy-collecting solar panels are deployed
380 miles above Earth, the highest a shuttle has ever gone.
</P>
<P>
Astronaut Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm
to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space on the second day of
the mission. The telescope's aperture door will be opened on the
next to allow the first starlight to strike the mirror.
</P>
<P>
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan,
veteran spacewalkers, will leave the cabin to assist if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle will follow Hubble from 40 miles away in case a problem
develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to Earth.
``You can never eliminate those oddball quirks of fate or
gremlins that may sneak up on any given day,'' Sullivan said. ``But
those are very remote potentials I really suspect we won't
encounter.''
In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of the telescope, $500
million has been spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts
and develop computer software to operate the instrument. The
European Space Agency contributed $250 million to the Hubble
project and will get to use the telescope 15 percent of the time.

Five astronauts boarded Discovery
today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into
orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to
the beginning of time.
``Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of
what the Hubble will be able to accomplish,'' said Lennard Fisk,
head of NASA science activities.
</P>
<P>
Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the
weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the
scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into
the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space
Center.
</P>
<P>
The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give
astronomers ``a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have,'' said
William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
``It's going to change our perspective altogether. I can't say
what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn
many new things.''
Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a
shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper
orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is the 35th
shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro
observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the
second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986
just before the Challenger explosion.
</P>
<P>
Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983,
delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. The
latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit
on the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less
festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of
astronomers gathered with their families.
</P>
<P>
The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will
use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope
into space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn
Sullivan will assist if a problem develops.
</P>
<P>
Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days
until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
</P>
<P>
Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by
satellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA said it
will release its first image _ an open star cluster in the
constellation Carina _ a week after launch.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has
been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software
to operate the instrument. The European Space Agency contributed
$250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.
</P>
<P>
NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and
maintain the telescope in space.
</P>
<P>
During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide
astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more
sensitivity than ground-based observatories. As a result, they will
be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been
traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15
billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery
surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also is
expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
</P>
<P>
The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding. His
work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created
by a tremendous explosion.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled
with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts
receive. It is the skull's third trip into space.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

Jubilant astronomers saw decades of
work take wing Tuesday as the Hubble Space Telescope was boosted
high above Earth to launch ``a great adventure for mankind.''
Charles Robert O'Dell, a Rice University space physicist who has
worked 19 years on Hubble, said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard
the shuttle capped an experience that was ``comparable to raising a
child. I've been with the program since it was a concept.
``There is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and
five of my friends thrust into orbit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Colin Norman, a physics and astronomy professor at Johns Hopkins
University and academic affairs director of the Space Telescope
Science Institute there, called the launch ``the perfect start to a
great adventure for mankind.
``It was incredibly beautiful. The power of the launch was
awesome and the telescope has an awesome power,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
Discovery's liftoff was especially gratifying since it ended
seven years of delays. The $1.5 billion telescope originally was
scheduled for launch in 1983 but remained grounded by technical
problems and the Challenger explosion.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the
Kennedy Space Center, the launch was scrubbed four minutes before
liftoff. Only a few dozen of them returned Tuesday, but they were
just as excited.
``There were times when we were deeply depressed. There were
times when we were elated'' about Hubble's progress, said William
H. Jeffreys, a University of Texas astronomer and Hubble's
astrometry project leader. Jeffreys said. ``This is one of those
times when we are thrilled beyond belief.''
Ed Weiler, NASA program scientist for Hubble, said watching the
liftoff was ``a double whammy'' because ``it was my first shuttle
launch and the launch of the HST. It really gets to you.''

Hubble Out of this World _ At Last
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years late, the Hubble Space
Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of
others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning
of time.
</P>
<P>
Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle
Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first
test radio signal. At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted
in Mission Control in Houston.
``As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect,'' said
astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle. Hawley's job on Wednesday
will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.
</P>
<P>
Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue
sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles
above Earth _ higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle. There
the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation
with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.
``Our window on the universe!'' NASA launch commentator George
Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.
``It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit
instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years,'' said
NASA administrator Richard Truly. ``Hubble's in its element and I'm
delighted.''
The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical
problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment. It
suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was
stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty
hydraulic unit on the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a
month to exercise and keep in readiness. In its first day in space,
that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the
Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of
scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in
astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly
400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked
about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working
station.
``Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that
Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?''' said
Truly, a former shuttle astronaut. ``It doesn't matter what day we
launch Hubble, it matters that we do it right.''
The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the
size of a railroad tank car. When it flies free, it will receive
electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two
wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side.
</P>
<P>
It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who
theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away
a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling. That gave support to the
theory that a massive explosion _ the Big Bang _ created the
universe 10 to 20 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major
questions: How old is the universe? How big is it?
</P>
<P>
The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, the
other 12 inches. Two of the instruments are cameras, two are
spectrometers and one is a photometer. In addition, the fine
pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise
measurement of distances.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with
the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point
it, and _ after a long checkout _ drop it overboard to orbit on its
own.
</P>
<P>
In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from
the shuttle. But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out
and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are
extended to receive light from the sun.
</P>
<P>
Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce
McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially
dressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to
unfurl the arrays manually.
</P>
<P>
Discovery's launch was not without its problems.
</P>
<P>
With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs
the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and
stopped the launch process. The problem was overcome and the
shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at
Edwards Air Force Base in California.
``On the way uphill,'' as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the
shuttle's windshield was splattered with ``several flecks of
things.'' He said the windshield was streaked by the debris and
that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off
during the climb to orbit.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit,
and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative. Neither
problem was considered serious.

<P>
Already they're saying it's the
biggest happening in astronomy since Galileo put his eye to a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
So, step right up folks, and discover the wonders of the
universe. See how big it is. Learn its age. Look at light created
14 billion years ago and arriving at your eye only this instant.
</P>
<P>
Ride along to the beginning of everything, almost, to the Big
Bang of 10 or 20 thousand million years ago. See stars born and see
them die. Watch galaxies form. Follow the flow of gas into the
Milky Way's halo. Peer deep into the universe, past so many stars
in our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetime
to count, to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about 200
billion stars.
</P>
<P>
For scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomes
possible now that the space shuttle Discovery has carried the
Hubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen
before. The telescope, a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck,
has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light.
</P>
<P>
Light, speeding along at 186,000 miles a second, is the
messenger of creation. Tracking the trail of light from today to
the first moments contains all the information we will ever have
about the creation of the universe.
</P>
<P>
The Hubble promises to give science an open window perhaps to
the first echoes of creation. This is a world-class event, even if
astronomy is not your thing.
</P>
<P>
Superlatives?
``In the history of optical astronomy there have been two great
leaps in the resolution of the universe: Galileo's telescope in the
autumn of 1609, and the Hubble Space Telescope in April 1990.'' _
Eric J. Chaisson, a senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
One more?
``No one ever made anything that good,'' James Westphal,
California Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
Another?
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predicts that the
Hubble telescope ``will literally be the dawn of a new era in
astronomy.''
Eras rarely can be proclaimed in advance. But the HST, named
after Edwin Powell Hubble, holds that kind of promise.
</P>
<P>
Hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century who
concluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from Earth
but that the farther away they are, the faster they move. The
theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the
universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is
still rushing from the site of that so-called Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers think the Big Bang occurred 12 billion to 20 billion
years ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incredible
speed and heat. Eventually matter cooled and condensed into
galaxies, stars and planets.
</P>
<P>
There are bigger telescopes than the Hubble, but they are all on
Earth and all subject to a major limitation _ the atmosphere _
which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through. The
problem of skywatching through layers of air has been likened to
birdwatching from the bottom of a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
The Voyager spacecraft, which sent back astonishing views of
Earth's sister planets, had to travel 12 years to get close enough
for pictures as they whizzed past. With the Hubble, says scientist
Edward Weiler, such pictures are possible any time we want.
</P>
<P>
The telescope is 42.5 by 14 feet and consists of a 94.5-inch
primary mirror that gathers incoming light.
``On a clear, dark night you can see a flashlight from two miles
away,'' says Weiler, chief NASA scientist on the Hubble project.
``With a 28-power telescope you can see it on the moon 250,000
miles away. With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia from
Washington.''

Discovery's astronauts overcame
balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free
from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3
minutes at an altitude of 380 miles _ high above the atmosphere,
which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes.
``Discovery, go for Hubble release,'' Mission Control told the
crew at 3:37 p.m. EDT. The event occurred a minute later as the
shuttle slowly and carefully backed away.
</P>
<P>
The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground
controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels
that power the telescope's instruments.
</P>
<P>
The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its
reel. Mission Control ordered space-walking astronauts to be ready
to go out of the cabin to help. But there was a third try and it
was successful.
``We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the
starboard side has been deployed,'' the telescope control center in
Maryland said.
``So we have good news,'' said Dave Drachlis, of the Hubble
control center.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power to
flow into the telescope's batteries, relieving worries that they
would use up their eight-hour charge.
</P>
<P>
Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12{-ton
telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its
instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and
shifted over to the batteries.
``Precisely one day after lifting off from Launch Pad 39B at
Kennedy Space Center, the Hubble Space Telescope is ready to fly on
its own,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. ``The game has
begun. The race is on. The clock is ticking.''
Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put on
spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk
outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the
solar panels failed.
</P>
<P>
Cameras aboard Discovery showed the telescope, being held at the
end of a 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight from its silver surface
and a turning Earth in the background.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver
maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position, with its nose
pointed toward the sun. That was to put the telescope's solar
arrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly start
collecting energy and protect the telescope's fixed star trackers
while the instrument was being held above the payload bay.
</P>
<P>
Discovery is in orbit 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher
than any previous shuttle. The orbit was dictated by the need to
put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
``For those technically inclined this morning, I'd like to pass
on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer (Hawley),
something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away
today,'' Shriver said.
</P>
<P>
The five astronauts' busy day began on a musical note early this
morning as Mission Control played a song called ``Space is Our
World,'' written by members of Discovery's training team and a
Houston-area group, Private Numbers.
</P>
<P>
Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight
Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected
so far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmanned
spacecraft ever built.
``Everything has just being going like clockwork,'' said Ron
Schlagheck, shift director of orbital verifications at Goddard.
``Everybody is in excellent spirits.''
The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problems and the 1986
Challenger accident, has waited seven years to take its place in
space. It finally got a ride into orbit Tuesday morning aboard
Discovery.
</P>
<P>
Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so
distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth. It
is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe,
and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes
and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support
life.
</P>
<P>
The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in
diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. When it is in
orbit, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific
instruments from two winglike solar arrays.
</P>
<P>
It is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whose
discovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave rise
to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a
tremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago.

After years of delay and a
last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the
shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight,
drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.
</P>
<P>
Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of
the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting
one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled.
``The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at
330 nautical miles above the Earth,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey
Carr said.
``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and
we sure hope it does good work,'' Discovery commander Loren J.
</P>
<P>
Shriver said later.
</P>
<P>
The $1.5 billion telescope was released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the
shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one
orbit later than planned. The shuttle then backed away.
``Thank you very much for the ride,'' said Mike Harrington,
director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had
been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the
solar panel. That proved to be unnecessary.
``Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the
way it did,'' Sullivan said. She and McCandless had trained for
nearly five years to make such a rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday Wednesday
as the shuttle passed 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles,
above South America's eastern coast. It started providing power to
the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of
charge.
</P>
<P>
Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more
troublesome. It wouldn't budge when latches were first released,
then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length, and stopped again.
</P>
<P>
A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way.
``Houston, we see motion,'' Commander Loren J. Shriver reported.
</P>
<P>
Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after
7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long
mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12{-ton telescope high
above the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
Hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was
lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own
nickel-hydrogen batteries.
``At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble
is now on its own internal power,'' Carr said. ``The game has
begun. The race is on. The clock is ticking.''
Worries that the telescope's instruments would be starved for
electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out.
</P>
<P>
Television cameras aboard Discovery showed the first array as it
was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting
off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope.
</P>
<P>
Discovery was 380 statute miles above Earth, 70 miles higher
than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was dictated by the need
to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view.
``I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board
astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks
far away today,'' Shriver said of Hawley.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place
in space. The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in
1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it
back.
</P>
<P>
The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power
unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before
April 10's scheduled liftoff.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting
Hubble out of this world and in search of others.
</P>
<P>
The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday,
exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
</P>
<P>
Discovery was following Hubble in case the door does not open
properly. If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be
prepared once again to walk in space.
</P>
<P>
Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said the telescope would
be tested Thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture
door is opened.
``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the
Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the
sensitivity of its five instruments.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.
</P>
<P>
NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope _ of
an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ on Tuesday. Data
will follow in a month or two.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the
time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been
traveling to Earth for 14 billion years. They expect to determine
precisely how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated
at 15 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P.
</P>
<P>
Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was
expanding. He also was responsible for helping to form the Big Bang
theory of creation.

<P>
Ground controllers at the Goddard
Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main
antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying
for more than six hours to lock on.
</P>
<P>
Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md.,
as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was
solved.
``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with
the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna
system,'' said NASA's Dave Drachlis.
</P>
<P>
Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were
working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing
either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications
satellite that acts as a switchboard.
</P>
<P>
In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the
antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2
degrees to 10.8 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit
information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies,
were working well.
</P>
<P>
Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy
certain problems. The outage was not a problem for which space
walkers would have been summoned.
</P>
<P>
The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of
storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing
experiments.
</P>
<P>
Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of
the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and
was not a serious problem. It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and
lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers
attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain
antennas through the TDRS.
``This time it was a pointing problem,'' said Jim Elliott, a
Goddard spokesman. ``It's a new spacecraft and we think
inexperience dealing with it was the cause.''
The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was
released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute
snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud
rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite.
``Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that
song,'' said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. ``There are a
lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and
Hubble had a good night while you were asleep.''
``We appreciate the good words from everybody,'' replied
Discovery Commander Loren Shriver.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery
away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of
maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park''
Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and
we sure hope it does good work,'' Shriver said Wednesday.
``Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work
you've done,'' replied Mission Control. ``Galileo is real proud of
you.''
Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASA's most expensive
unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since
Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope
while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is
operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.
</P>
<P>
The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot
aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
</P>
<P>
Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from
the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
</P>
<P>
Data will follow in a month or two.
</P>
<P>
If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could
return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk
to fix it.
</P>
<P>
Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be
tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door
is opened.
``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the
Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he
said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive
instruments.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist
it from the cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as
expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries,
which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
</P>
<P>
But there was trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge
when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its
39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way out
on the third attempt.
</P>
<P>
By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away
from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance
call.
</P>
<P>
Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
</P>
<P>
The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70
miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was
dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the
beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their
light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope to
determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated
at 15 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but
was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
</P>
<P>
Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to
land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

Ground controllers cheered after
re-establishing contact Thursday with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope through its main antennas.
</P>
<P>
An attempt six hours earlier had failed.
``I'm pretty relieved, I must say,'' said Al Boggess, Hubble
project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
Applause erupted at Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control
Center when the high-speed contact was made Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Controllers sent information to the telescope about its
location, and ``this basically improved the telescope's knowledge
where it was, what its position was,'' said Goddard's Dave
Drachlis. They also widened the radio beam to cover a larger area
around the two high-speed dish antennas.
``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with
the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna
system,'' Drachlis reported.
</P>
<P>
The antennas are the primary communications links for relaying
scientific information to the ground.
</P>
<P>
Controllers' lack of experience with the new satellite was part
of the problem, Boggess said.
``This probably won't be the last time we have a problem,'' he
said. ``We'll keep working at it until we have all these things
that need to be done, done. We'll get them right.''
The problem began Thursday morning when engineers tried pointing
the two high-speed antennas toward two widely-separated TDRS
satellites without success. Two low-speed antennas were working
fine, but Boggess said they would be ``excruciatingly slow'' for
sending data.
</P>
<P>
There had been a communications outage with the telescope
earlier. It lasted only 45 minutes and was due to human error.
</P>
<P>
In addition, one of four ``rate gyros,'' wheels whose spin
maintains the telescope in a stable position, was disconnected by
an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain
immediately. But it was restored later and the stability of the
satellite was unaffected.
</P>
<P>
The problems won't delay the schedule for putting the telescope
into use, said Jean Oliver, Hubble deputy project manager at
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
``Now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what
part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do
differently in the future to make it continue to work,'' Boggess
said. ``Having done it once, we've got confidence we can do it and
that means the mission can proceed.''
Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope
and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door was opened,
set for Friday morning. Its five astronauts spent the day doing
experiments and taking pictures of storms over Texas and other
views of Earth from 380 miles up, the highest a shuttle has ever
flown.
</P>
<P>
When the door covering the telescope aperture is opened,
starlight will strike the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch
mirror for the first time.
</P>
<P>
If signals fail to activate the 10-foot-wide aluminum aperture
door, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan
will go into open space and crank it open Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif. The mission would be extended a day if the space walk
became necessary.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
releases its first image from the telescope, an open star cluster
in the constellation Carina. Scientific data will follow in a month
or two.
</P>
<P>
The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is
named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953. The
Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe
is expanding, a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe
was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space
telescope.

The lens cover on the Hubble Space
Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and
Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are
needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.
``You've been released from Hubble support; it's on its own,''
Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door
opened.
``Thank you, sir, that's great news,'' said Discovery Commander
Loren J. Shriver.
``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here,'' said
Steve Hawley, who had been at the controls when the telescope was
released into its own orbit on Wednesday. ``I'll bet it's just that
way down there, too.''
The successful opening of the lens cover paved the way for the
astronauts to return to Earth on Sunday. They had blasted into
space Tuesday after a two-week delay and dispatched the telescope
from its payload bay Wednesday.
``The Hubble is open for business,'' Mission Control told the
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
The telescope still was having problems, however. When the door
opened, two of its four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped
working and the electronic system went into an automatic ``safe
mode'' in which all motion is stopped.
</P>
<P>
The team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which
guides the telescope, said the door-opening motion jarred the
telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted
properly in shutting down.
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, a step-by-step procedure was begun to bring
the telescope's electronics back on line.
</P>
<P>
Steve Terry, a top Hubble engineering official, said tolerances
for the telescope systems had been set particularly narrow for the
first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions. In
addition to the trouble this morning, there two communications
outages Thursday totaling several hours.
``We're cautious, and that's natural,'' he said. ``We've got a
very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything to
jeopardize the usefulness. ... We'll get to the point where we know
exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits
appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
NASA announced that ``at this time the telescope is safe,
stable.''
The space shuttle Discovery, which carried the telescope to
orbit, was 50 miles behind the telescope, ready to lend a hand if
needed. Later in the day, the ship was to do an engine firing that
would set it on a preliminary path for home.
</P>
<P>
That path would take the Discovery two miles below the telescope.
</P>
<P>
The lens cover, a 10-foot diameter ``aperature door,'' covers
the opening to the telescope's light shield. When it is closed, the
telescope is blind.
</P>
<P>
The lens cover had been closed _ except for a tiny wedge opening
_ ever since the $1.5 billion telescope was dropped overboard by
the Discovery crew on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Now that it is opened, starlight can strike the lens for the
first time and it can go about its business of photographing and
analyzing the universe in ways and with sensitivity never before
possible.
</P>
<P>
The door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets covered on the
outside with solar-reflecting material. The inside is painted black
to absorb stray light.
</P>
<P>
If the door opening command had failed, the five Discovery
astronauts who deployed Hubble were prepared to head back to the
telescope. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan would have performed a space walk to open the door
Saturday if necessary.
</P>
<P>
If it had been needed, the rescue would have delayed the
landing, scheduled for Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., by
a day.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts were awakened at 2:30 a.m. EDT to the mellow
sounds of the Beach Boys' song, ``Kokomo.''
``For Max Q's keyboard, that's the way that song should really
be done,'' Mission Control radioed to mission specialist Steve
Hawley, a member of the all-astronaut band called Max Q. ``Your
next practice is Sunday evening in the gym, don't be late.''
Max Q is a NASA acronym for the point in the shuttle's ascent
when the aerodynamic pressure is at its greatest point.
``That sounds just like the way we do it,'' replied Hawley. ``If
you get us home by Sunday, I'll go to practice.''
In an orbit high enough to avoid Earth's distorting atmosphere,
Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so
distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth. It
is capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times
greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
</P>
<P>
During its 15-year working lifetime, Hubble is expected to help
determine the age and size of the universe. It may solve the
mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars
with planets that could conceivably support life.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, NASA plans to release its first test image from the
telescope, an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
</P>
<P>
Significant data will follow in a month or two.

The Hubble Space Telescope orbited
with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame
communications problems and lifted its lens cover, but its
electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.
</P>
<P>
Those problems, however, were not the immediate concern of
shuttle Discovery's astronauts, who prepared for Sunday's return to
Earth.
``You've been released from Hubble support. It's on its own,''
Mission Control's Story Musgrave told the five crew members.
``That's great news,'' replied Discovery commander Loren J.
</P>
<P>
Shriver.
``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here. I'll bet
it's just that way back down there, too,'' added mission specialist
Steven Hawley. ``Who's buying tonight?''
``We'll buy when you all get back,'' Musgrave replied.
</P>
<P>
Flight director William Reeves said it was too early to cheer.
`We still have an important part of the mission to go,'' Reeves
said. ``We reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on the
ground.''
Discovery is to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif. Landing would have been delayed a day if
astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had to perform
a space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover, or aperture
door.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperture
door opened 380 miles above Earth, but passed 3.7 miles beneath the
telescope later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to
release its first test image from the $1.5 billion telescope on
Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
</P>
<P>
But Steve Terry, director of orbital verifications, said that would
be delayed by problems with Hubble's high-speed antennas.
</P>
<P>
Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
</P>
<P>
Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the
heavens at 10:30 a.m. EDT, nearly four hours later than planned,
exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift
even though the telescope was in an automatic ``safe mode,'' with
all motion stopped because of problems in linking its high-speed
dish antennas with a relay satellite.
</P>
<P>
One of the two antennas apparently had swung too far, and the
telescope shut down, said Jean Oliver, a Hubble deputy project
manager. If future movements of the antenna have to be limited to
avoid the problem, it would have only slight impact on the
telescope's observing time, Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
Terry said the opening of the aperture door could not have been
delayed much longer.
``There has to be a point where you say they have to go their
way and we have to go ours,'' he said of the astronauts.
</P>
<P>
When the door opened, two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing
gyroscopes stopped working; later, engineers got them back on line.
</P>
<P>
The motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros, said Dave
Drachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. That, too,
kept it in the safe mode.
</P>
<P>
Oliver said it would be Saturday morning before the telescope is
brought out of the safe mode. It will take another day to get the
instrument operating normally again, putting controllers at Goddard
several days behind.
``We're trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut any
corners and do anything fast because we feel there's a lot at risk
here and we want to make sure we're doing it properly,'' Oliver
said. ``We've got a long future ahead of us, and we want to make
sure it starts off on the right foot.''
</P>
<P>
NASA said the telescope was safe and in a stable position.
</P>
<P>
Tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly
narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many
malfunctions, Terry said. In addition to that trouble, there were
two communications outages totaling several hours.
``We're cautious, and that's natural,'' Terry said. ``We've got
a very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything
to jeopardize the usefulness. ... We'll get to the point where we
know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits
appropriately.''
Terry said Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the
master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting
communications system is lost for extended periods. The telescope
will share the system, known as Tracking and Data Relay Satellites,
with other space craft.
</P>
<P>
Except for a tiny wedge opening, the lens cover had been closed
and the telescope blind ever since Hubble was released by the
astronauts Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
From its orbit high above Earth's distorting atmosphere, the
telescope will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime
to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the
universe. The universe is believed to have been created about 15
billion years ago in a cosmic explosion.
</P>
<P>
The late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, for whom the telescope is
named, provided the basis for the Big Bang theory of creation. He
discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that
the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away.
</P>
<P>
In honor of the astronomer, Sullivan carried with her into space
an eyepiece from the 100-inch telescope at California's Mount
Wilson Observatory that Hubble used to make his pioneering
observations.
``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical
significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin
Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' she said Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Once back on Earth, the eyepiece will be displayed at the
observatory.

The Hubble Space Telescope was
awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without
the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments
were on hold, unable to begin any observations.
``We are out of the `safe-mode' right now,'' said Steve Terry, a
supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope. He said the
telescope was running on a ``normal control-all mode,'' where its
own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.
</P>
<P>
Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a
return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth
and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight.

Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the
widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected
eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the
birth of the universe.
``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard
of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' said Bolden. ``It makes little
kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to learn how to add
and subtract and study science.''
The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been
in a ``safe mode'' with all motion stopped because of earlier
problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay
satellite. The antennas are the primary links for relaying
scientific data to the ground.
</P>
<P>
Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders
in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and
that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas
are working properly.
``We expect to use that data to investigate what happened,'' he
said. Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its
secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for
scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.
``We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in
effect a standby mode,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands
that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run
a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.
</P>
<P>
It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is
operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup
process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.
``We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful
approach to these problems,'' Olivier said Friday. ``This is not
the time to do anything dumb.''
The telescope problems have put the flight center several days
behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week
were sticking to their schedule.
</P>
<P>
Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close
watch on the weather.
</P>
<P>
Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.
</P>
<P>
Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days
beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.
</P>
<P>
Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT
today by playing the song, ``Cosmos.''
``Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for
today,'' said Commander Loren Shriver.
``The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope,
which is now open for business,'' said Mission Control commentator
James Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and
photography today and pack for the trip home. They also planned to
hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson
Space Center.
</P>
<P>
Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of
tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were
ready for return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close
to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture
door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan
were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in
orbit 380 miles above Earth.
</P>
<P>
But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday
morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to
starlight for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped
working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on
line. The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too,
kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director
of orbital verifications at Goddard.
</P>
<P>
A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at
conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many
malfunctions. There also were two communications outages totaling
several hours.
</P>
<P>
Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of
its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications
system is lost for extended periods, Terry said.
</P>
<P>
NASA had planned to release its first test image from the
telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the
constellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed because
of the antenna problems. Scientific data will follow in a month or
two.
</P>
<P>
The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look
back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion
years ago in a cosmic explosion.
</P>
<P>
Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.
</P>
<P>
He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and
that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving
away.
