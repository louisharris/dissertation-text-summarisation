``The Iraqi government firmly believes and states that Iraq is
pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations
with Kuwait. Furthermore, it is the Kuwaitis themselves who will
determine their own future and Iraqi forces will withdraw as soon
as order has been restored.'' _ Sabah Talat Kadrat, Iraq's deputy
permanent representative to the United Nations.

``The pretext to invade an independent, sovereign state is a
false, flimsy pretext. This kind of pretext, if it's not going to
be deterred in a decisive manner and by this august assembly, all
international relations will be threatened. No country at all will
be safe after this.'' _ Mohammad Abulhasan, Kuwait's ambassador to
the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
THE INVASION: Iraq's troops, led by about 350 tanks, crossed the
border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and
government buildings 40 miles away. Early Friday, the invaders
controlled Kuwait city, the capital. The soldiers were also making
sweeps through the southern oilfields, according to residents and
Lloyds' insurance service in London. Diplomatic sources estimate
more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the
Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion. Kuwait's
Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah fled to safety in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the
Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than
100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border. Kuwait, an oil-rich
city-state, has 1.9 million residents _ 60 percent foreigners _ and
an army of 20,300 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accused
Kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil
prices through overproduction. Kuwait and U.N. diplomats dismissed
Iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
REACTION: The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the
invasion.
</P>
<P>
President Bush denounced it as ``naked agression.'' He froze
Iraq's assets in the United States and blocked almost all Iraqi
imports, including oil. The order also froze Kuwait property under
U.S. jurisdiction _ a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it.
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the nation had asked for American
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon source said a U.S. naval group was diverted toward
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices soared in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion
would reduce the supply of oil.

<TEXT>
<P>
Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and
Kuwait over oil production and their common border.
</P>
<P>
July 17 _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices
down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf are
conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's
economy and undermine its military buildup.
</P>
<P>
July 18 _ Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of
oil from wells along the disputed border with Iraq and of seeking
to wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down
prices.
</P>
<P>
July 20 _ Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of
belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _ including Kuwait _
to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
July 24 _ The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navy
warships and aircraft are holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in
the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles
southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait reinstates a state of
alert it declared July 16 and canceled after three days of tension
between the two oil-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
July 25 _ The Iraqi government in Baghdad says that it will not
be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring
Kuwait, and Saddams summons the U.S. ambassador for talks.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait plan to meet
in Saudi Arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute.
</P>
<P>
July 26 _ OPEC ministers in Geneva agree to halt overproduction
in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil. Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates pledge to abide by the agreement. Analysts say
Saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
July 31 _ Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations meet in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, to negotiate the oil and border dispute. Diplomats say Iraq
has massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border, more than triple the
number originally estimated. That number dwarfs the Kuwaiti army,
which has a total of about 20,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Aug. 1 _ Iraq pulls out of talks on the 2-week-old border, oil
and money dispute with Kuwait shortly before it sends its forces to
invade the oil-rich sheikdom.
</P>
<P>
Aug. 2 _ Iraq's powerful army overruns Kuwait before dawn with
tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and other
government buildings.

In Iran, Saddam is Generalissimo, Foster Child and Frankenstein
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iranian editorial writers are rejoicing
now that the world is waking up to one of their most hated
bogeymen: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
A Monday headline: ``We warned you Frankenstein would torment
his own creators.''
Saddam attacked Iran in September 1980 after a series of border
skirmishes, spawning a war that dragged until an August 1988
cease-fire. The conflict has still not formally ended.
</P>
<P>
Iran's late fundamentalist patriarch, the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, vowed for years to unseat Saddam. Never at a loss for a
vivid phrase, he compared accepting the cease-fire with Saddam to
drinking poison.
</P>
<P>
The status of Great Satan was reserved for the United States,
the all-encompassing public enemy No. 1 for the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Iran frequently accuses both the U.S. and Saddam of trying to
undermine the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Saddam conveniently boasts of having alone staunched the tide of
radical Islam. In fact one of his reasons for invading Kuwait on
Thursday, the Iraqi press noted, was its gall in demanding back
tens of billions of dollars loaned to Iraq during the war Saddam
says he fought for all Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six months, successful U.N.-sponsored efforts
toward face-to-face negotiations between Iraq and Iran robbed
Iranian newspapers and television commentators of a favorite target.
</P>
<P>
Saddam's overthrow of the emir of Kuwait changed all that.
</P>
<P>
Old scores came brimming to the surface. Kuwait, after all,
reflagged tankers in the United States during the Iran-Iraq war,
ushering in the reason for the arrival of the U.S. Navy in the
Persian Gulf in force.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency printed excerpts
Mondya of an editorial from the Ettela'at newspaper that was
headlined: ``Foster child turns rapaciously on nourisher Kuwait.''
It noted that Kuwait had blindly supported Iraq, ``little
knowing that it was feeding a wild beast in her own neighborhood.''
Saddam has also been called generalissimo and The Invader.
</P>
<P>
Under the Frankenstein headline, IRNA said in its own commentary:
``For the time being, tiny Kuwait ... breathes no more. With its
sheikh a stateless person, and its powerful dinar which bankrolled
the Iraqi military mere garbage, Kuwait is a nonentity, swallowed
up by the dangerous pet it reared.''
Despite all the attention to the dangerous pet, the Great Satan
has not been forgotton. According to Iran's pundits, the Great
Satan planned it all. It wanted to get the Navy back in the Persian
Gulf.

78 Foreigners Arrive in Amman from Iraq
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Iraqi airways jet carrying 78 foreigners
and a number of Iraqi citizens arrived today, the first commercial
flight allowed out of Iraq since it invaded Kuwait, a Japanese
Embassy spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The mostly Japanese tourists arrived at Amman airport at 6:15
p.m. (11:15 a.m. EDT) along with 34 members of an Iraqi football
team, said the spokesman on condition of anonymity. It was not
immediately known if there were Americans on board.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plane was due to leave Amman for an undisclosed
destination.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the plane was supposed to land in Vienna, but
it was denied landing rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Monday voted economic sanctions
that ban all trade and military ties with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's information minister, Ibrahim Izzedine, said earlier
today that the U.S. government had asked Jordan to facilitate the
entrance from Iraq of American diplomats and their dependents.
</P>
<P>
Izzedine said the request was made through the U.S. Embassy in
Amman.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Westerners have been stranded in Kuwait and Iraq
since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday. They include more than 350
who were on a British Airways flight that was caught in the unrest
in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A British Airways spokeswoman said today a ``substantial''
number of those passengers arrived safely in Baghdad on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Among the passengers were 28 Americans, who also turned up in a
Baghdad hotel and appear to be fine, a U.S. official said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Kuwaiti businessman said about 1,000 people a day
were fleeing Kuwait through the desert to Saudi Arabia. The
businessman, who arrived in London on a British Airways flight from
Bahrain today, said Kuwaitis and expatriates, including Westerners,
were joining convoys to escape the Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's borders with Iraq had been closed from the Iraqi side
since Thursday morning, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The ``provisional
government of free Kuwait'' set up by Iraq had threatened Sunday to
hold hostage citizens of countries imposing sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. diplomat said Washington had instructed ``American
citizens living in or visiting Iraq and Kuwait to leave when
circumstances permit.''

<P>
Hitting Baghdad where it hurts, more countries have
joined a U.N.-sanctioned boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, countries ranging from powerful Japan to neutral
Switzerland to tiny Cyprus cut off petroleum imports in an effort
to convince the Baghdad government to withdraw its troops that
invaded Kuwait on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey announced it was shut down the twin Iraqi oil pipelines
that run through it to the Mediterranean _ carrying half of
Baghdad's crude output _ and cutting off trade with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad's only other major pipelines exporting crude run through
Saudi Arabia, where the flow has been drastically reduced.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Monday voted to impose broad
economic sanctions against Iraq for invading small oil-rich Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The measure forbids loans to Iraq or Kuwait and prohibits any
activities, including the transfer of money, that would help the
two countries export their goods.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions adopted by the European Economic Community on Saturday
froze Iraqi assets and suspended the purchase of oil from the two
Arab countries. More than 90 percent of imports from Iraq to the
12-nation EEC are petroleum products. The EEC also suspended arms
sales to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, which is not a member of the United Nations, made
the unusual move Tuesday of joining the U.N. sanctions and banned
all trade with Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. In addition,
Switzerland prohibited all payments and other financial transfers
to Iraq and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, Norway and Sweden also announced embargoes on all trade
with both countries.
</P>
<P>
Japan's participation in the U.N. sanctions was seen as
especially key since Tokyo usually has taken a low profile in the
Middle East, which supplies much of its petroleum needs. Japan
imports 99 percent of its oil.
</P>
<P>
China joined the U.N. decision to embargo arms sales to Iraq,
but has been less vocal than other major countries in condemning
the invasion. China sold arms to both Iran and Iraq during their
eight-year war and is a major Iraqi trade partner.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' sacrifice in joining the embargo was to give up 70
percent of its oil imports, government spokesman Akis Fantis said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has sufficient oil supplies to last until the end of August,
he said, but ``we are already in the process of taking steps to
secure alternative sources ...''
The worldwide closing of ranks against Iraqi oil imports is
likely to lead to even higher petroleum prices, which have already
risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact
on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale oil prices soared to five-year highs in New York on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
France will introduce controls Thursday on prices of petroleum
products to prevent refiners from using Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
as an excuse to raise prices, acting Premier Pierre Beregovoy
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Petroleum Association of Japan said he was
unaware of any increase yet in the price of gasoline for consumers.
</P>
<P>
The official, who refused to be further identified, said it would
be at least three months before the sanctions could be expected to
force higher gas prices in Japan.

<P>
Iraq's powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this 
small, oil-rich kingdom. Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and 
government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in 
the capital and were moving south toward the country's oil facilities. He 
appealed for U.S. military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!" a Kuwaiti government official shouted 
in a telephone interview. Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf estimated that 
more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed that it invaded at the 
request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established "the 
provisional government of free Kuwait." Kuwait and U.N. diplomats labeled the 
coup report a farce. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad television said Iraq could withdraw its forces within days or weeks, 
depending on how quickly the situation stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and Iraq, caused by 
Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area. Saddam 
also accused Kuwait of exceeding OPEC production quotas, thus driving down the 
price of oil, a major Iraqi revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000 troops at the 
border. Kuwait's entire armed forces has 20,300 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in modern history that an Arab nation had invaded another 
and taken over its government. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq, battle-hardened after eight years of war 
with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after 
crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn. Witnesses said the bombardment of 
ports and military airports by artillery and the air force was vicious. 
</P>
<P>
The invaders surrounded the palace of Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al 
Sabah. Residents said the palace was seized after about two hours of heavy 
artillery barrages. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Sheik Fahd al Ahmed al Sabah, one of the emir's brothers, was 
killed while trying to defend the palace. 
</P>
<P>
There were about 50 tanks around the palace and the neighboring American 
Embassy, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
The al Sabah family has ruled the city-state for almost 250 years. The Kuwaiti 
ambassador said the leaders were safe in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Operating from an unknown location, al Ahmed's government responded to the 
formation of the provisional government by stating: "Kuwait is Kuwait to its 
people, led by the emir, Sheik Jabbar, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad. God 
preserve them from all harm." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the provisional government announced through Baghdad's official 
Iraqi News Agency that it was dissolving Parliament and would hold "free and 
honest elections" at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's land and sea borders were closed, as was the airport.

IRAQIS SEIZE WESTERNERS; 
HUNDREDS ROUNDED UP DURING SWEEP OF KUWAIT HOTELS; 
U.N. COUNCIL VOTES BROAD SANCTIONS 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq struck back against the West today, rounding up hundreds of foreign 
nationals in Kuwait, as the U.N. Security Council overwhelming approved 
sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq to punish it for invading 
the emirate. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invaders scoured hotels looking for some of the thousands of 
Westerners based in Kuwait or caught by the invasion. More than 1 million 
foreigners live and work in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans were grabbed in the hotels, 
and some were taken to Iraq, the West German and British foreign ministries 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Britain said Baghdad had given no reason for detaining 366 people, most of them 
passengers from a British Airways flight stranded at Kuwait airport by the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions, which included a ban on oil purchases, came on a vote of 13 
to 0, on the 15-member council. Cuba and Yemen abstained on the resolution, 
which was proposed by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-installed Kuwait government had earlier warned foreign countries that 
they should not forget their citizens in Kuwait while heaping on economic 
punishments, and today's roundup appeared to be a reaction against the 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops rolled into its New Jersey-sized neighbor Thursday, conquering the 
capital and moving south toward the Saudi Arabian border. 
</P>
<P>
Persian Gulf oil sources said today that they had seen Saudi troops moving 
north toward the Kuwaiti frontier near the oil port of Khafji, but the Saudis 
denied that they had sent reinforcements to the border. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi authorities today told Turkey's state-run pipeline company that one of 
the twin pipelines that carry Baghdad's oil through Turkey will be closed "for 
reasons of marketing," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
World oil prices soared to their highest level in more than four years today as 
more countries joined the attempt to strangle Baghdad's economy and force it to 
withdraw its invasion troops. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil revenues totaled more than $11 billion last year. It has been 
pressing for higher oil prices to rebuild an economy damaged by the 1980-88 war 
with Iran and settle foreign debts of up to $80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Iraq gave for invading Kuwait was Kuwaiti reluctance to slow 
its flow of oil and push oil prices higher, but it was Iraqi oil that had 
slowed today. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few tankers loading Iraqi oil at Yumurtalik," a senior Turkish 
government official said, referring to the export jetties on the Turkish side 
of the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, President Saddam Hussein ordered drills for millions of people in 
case mass evacuations were needed. 
</P>
<P>
He warned his nation's 17 million people to be on alert for possible U.S. or 
Israeli attacks. The United States has warned Iraq against any attack on Saudi 
Arabia, and President Bush has said all options are open for the United States. 
</P>

Hundreds of Kuwaitis took to the desert to flee into Saudi Arabia, their 
children and a few belongings crammed into four-wheel-drive vehicles.

Invading Iraqis have been permitted to take over the homes and even wear the 
clothes of Kuwaitis who have been killed or have fled their homeland, Kuwait's 
ambassador to the United States charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah said in an interview that he had spoken by 
telephone to several Kuwaitis taking refuge in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, who 
reported that the Iraqis had made it easy for them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the fleeing Kuwaitis apparently are being replaced by Iraqis 
seeking to meld in with the local population, he contended. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trucking them in, busing them in, trying to replace the population, 
to change the makeup of the place," Saud said, adding they were issuing the new 
residents cards that identify them as Kuwaiti citizens. "They are giving them 
Kuwaiti clothes in order to make it appear that these are the people of Kuwait. 
They are taking the houses, robbing the houses." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials who have been detained by the Iraqi military and who have 
refused to cooperate have been executed, Saud claimed, adding: "We have 
eyewitness reports. Some were bused back to Baghdad for further interrogation. 
We don't know what has become of them." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti refugees have also reported that almost all government buildings and 
palaces have been blown up and destroyed, Saud said. 
</P>
<P>
There has been "mass destruction," he said, noting that all official 
installations except the water system and oil equipment are ruined. "Everything 
is gone."
