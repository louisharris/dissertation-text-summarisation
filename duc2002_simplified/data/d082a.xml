Moscow News Paints Sympathetic Portrait of the Sakharovs at Home
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Soviet newspaper has painted a highly
sympathetic portrait of Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner,
countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as
traitors by the state-run media.
</P>
<P>
But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned the
nearly seven years Sakharov spent in forced internal exile for
criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, indicating that
topic is still too sensitive.
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue, the weekly devoted its entire back page to
describing the home life of Sakharov, 66, the 1975 Nobel Peace
Prize winner, and said the words most often heard in his
seventh-floor Moscow apartment are ``help me.''
Sakharov's apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a mecca
for Soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed to
return from exile in the closed city of Gorky in December 1986.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Sakharov, who was one of the creators of his
nation's hydrogen bomb, has vocally supported Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reform campaign, but has called for the liberation
of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Past Soviet reports, published before Gorbachev became Soviet
leader, accused Bonner of marrying Sakharov for his money and said
the couple lived in ``oriental luxury'' amid ``scandals between
spouses.''
Moscow News depicted the couple as living peacefully and
frugally, eating cabbage, beet soup, potatoes, and other simple
fare, and marveled that Sakharov, a member of the prestigious
Academy of Sciences, always does the dishes himself.
</P>
<P>
While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the
author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and
scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News
said.
``Sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed
that he write an apology for all the lies that were published,''
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It reported that when the unidentified author refused, Sakharov
said, ``It's too bad that duels are abolished in our times,'' and
slapped him.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov has been quoted numerous times by Soviet media since
his return from exile, but the article in Moscow News was the
longest devoted to him so far.
</P>
<P>
But most of the newspaper's circulation is among foreign
tourists and readers abroad, so relatively few Soviets would see
the Sakharov article. As well as appearing in Russian, Moscow News
also prints editions in English, French and other languages.

Weekly Prints Sympathetic Portrait of Sakharov, His Wife
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet media once branded Andrei D. Sakharov a
traitor, but a Moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic
portrait of the human rights activist and his wife.
</P>
<P>
This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said that
Sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past
charges leveled at Sakharov and his wife, fellow dissident Yelena
Bonner, by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media.
</P>
<P>
Moscow News also pointedly notes that the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize
winner has praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for social and
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence in
their seventh-floor Moscow apartment, eating cabbage, beet soup,
potatoes and other simple fare, and Sakharov insists on washing the
dishes afterward himself, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said their two-room home was always filled with people
seeking Sakharov's aid, and that the words most often heard there
are: ``Help me.'' But Moscow News asked: ``Can he really do
everything?''
Although the full-page article was the longest on Sakharov to
date in the Soviet press, it made only indirect reference to the
nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the
Kremlin's intervention in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, a brilliant physicist, was allowed to return to Moscow
in December 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city of
Gorky, where he was banished without trial in January 1980.
``In effect, sometimes Sakharov bitterly jokes that he'd like to
return to Gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on
scientific work,'' Moscow News said. ``Of course, concerning Gorky,
that's a bitter joke.''
Since his return to Moscow, Sakharov has been a vocal supporter
of Gorbachev's program for nationwide reforms that includes the
policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected topics.
``He simply believes that something helped change the thoughts
of the majority into state policy,'' Moscow News said.``He calls
perestroika (restructuring) an enormous event for our country and
for the entire world.''
However, Sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improving
the Soviet record on human rights, and during a Jan. 15 meeting in
the Kremlin, he handed Gorbachev a list of 200 people he said were
imprisoned for their views.
</P>
<P>
Moscow News noted that in 1975, in a tract titled ``Knowledge
and the World,'' Sakharov set forth his views on Soviet affairs.
</P>
<P>
Those writings have not been published in the Soviet Union.
``Now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then,
and those ideas that we are putting forward today,'' Moscow News
said.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov called for a ban on nuclear testing long before the
Kremlin. The human rights activist, one of the most prominent
members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the
1970s, sought openness in Soviet society years before ``glasnost''
became Communist Party policy.
</P>
<P>
Much of the Moscow News article seemed designed to undo harm
caused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them.
</P>
<P>
It said one Soviet book accused the Sakharovs of living in
``oriental luxury'' and engaging in ``scandals between spouses.''
Moscow News said Sakharov was stubborn, unassuming, an
undisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man with
his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and
the demands of this life.
</P>
<P>
His strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he do
the dishes after meals, wrote the reporter who visited Sakharov at
his apartment.
``What is that, Andrei Dmitrievich, your hobby?'' asked Moscow
News correspondent Gennady Zhavoronkov.
``Not all guests are able to wash the dishes conscientiously,''
Sakharov replied.

Sakharov's Trip Largely Ignored by Soviet Media
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The visit by human rights activist Andrei D.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state
media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition
to the U.S. ``Star Wars'' program.
</P>
<P>
That report from Radio Moscow, carried on its
international-service news programs Tuesday, apparently was the only
mention made by Soviet media of Sakharov's visit to the United
States, which began Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the comments about the Reagan
administration's space-based anti-missile program at a Boston news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, is scheduled to
spend two weeks visiting relatives in the United States, undergoing
medical tests and promoting a new international organization he
belongs to.
</P>
<P>
A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident
movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal
exile after criticizing the Kremlin's military drive into
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow in
December 1986. Some statements and articles by Sakharov have been
printed in the Soviet media since then, including an article last
week in a magazine that opposed some elements of Gorbachev's
blueprint for political and electoral reforms.
</P>
<P>
Other activities by Sakharov have gone unreported here, including
his delivery to Gorbachev of a list of 200 Soviets reportedly held
in prison, labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of their
political views.
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency reported Wednesday that the
organization Sakharov belongs to _ the International Foundation for
the Survival and Development of Humanity _ held its first session in
Boston the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Tass made no mention of Sakharov in its three-paragragh report,
but said the Soviet delegation to the meeting was headed by Yevgeny
Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

Sakharov Receives Human Rights Award
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrei D. Sakharov, the father of the Soviet
dissident movement, finally received a 1973 human rights award
Thursday night during his first trip to New York City.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov received the Human Rights Award from the International
League for Human Rights at a reception at the home of Ronald Lauder,
the former U.S. ambassador to Austria.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is on his first trip to
the West, less than two years after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
freed him from internal exile in the city of Gorky. The human rights
activist was banished in 1980 to the closed city for opposing the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
About 200 guests, including author Elie Wiesel, Brooklyn District
Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, designer Caroline Roehm and ABC
television's Barbara Walters, attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was closed to the media. Sakharov, wearing a blue
beret and plaid scarf, made no statement as he left the reception
and entered a waiting limousine.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov is the honorary president of the league, which has its
headquarters in the United States and more than 40 affiliate groups
around the world, including the Moscow Human Rights Committee, which
Sakharov and his colleagues founded in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov arrived in the United States on Sunday to visit
relatives and receive medical treatment before going to Washington
for a White House visit and a board meeting of the International
Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, of which he
is a director.

Sakharov Challenges Science Academy Legislative Slate
</HL>

<P>
Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of
Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for
the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace
Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, who
won the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that many
scientists objected to the slate for Sunday's election approved by
the leadership in January.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov and several other well-known proponents of reform are
missing from the list. The official news agency Tass quoted him as
saying, however, that scientists were upset ``not because Sakharov
was not nominated, but because the role of scientific institutions
was ignored.''
He called for reversal of what he called the anti-democratic
decision, which produced a list of what critics describe as
old-guard managers of scientific institutions.
</P>
<P>
A vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a
seat in the new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, but he
decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of
Sciences seat.
</P>
<P>
Under an election law approved in December, 750 seats in the
legislature are reserved for the Communist Party and its affiliates
and for professional, social and trade union organizations. The
other 1,500 will be filled by representatives of the 15 Soviet
republics and their electoral districts.
</P>
<P>
Those in the academy who support Sakharov hope to force a new
round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all
nominees a majority, said Andrei Mironov, a former political
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
That would force the academy to start over and produce a new list
of nominees under terms of the new election law.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five seats were allotted to the academy, but it gave five
to affiliated societies and associations. From 121 nominees, the
academy leadership chose 23 candidates for the remaining 20 seats.
</P>
<P>
Although 60 research institutes nominated Sakharov, he was not
chosen for the final slate. The leadership's decision inspired
widespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academy's
Moscow headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Tass said 1,108 academicians, corresponding members and
representatives of reseach institutes attended the three-day meeting
that began Monday.
``The first three days of this week may become the `hottest'
spring days for Soviet scientists,'' it said, alluding to the
leadership's rejection of such reformers as Sakharov, space
scientist Roald Sagdeev and sociologist Tatyana Zaslavsakaya.
</P>
<P>
The agency acknowledged ``many scientists were unsatisfied'' with
the slate of candidates.
</P>
<P>
Mironov said two other academicians also spoke on Monday in favor
of new nominations. No details of their remarks were available.

Kremlin Eulogizes Onetime Foe as `Man of Honesty and Sincerity'
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov as
a ``man of honesty and sincerity'' who suffered great injustice at
the hands of previous rulers.
</P>
<P>
An obituary signed by Gorbachev, five other members of the
ruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading officials and
scholars was printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 of
the party daily Pravda.
</P>
<P>
Such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and
scientists, and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 Nobel
Peace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a
funeral commission in a black box on its front page.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, 68, died Thursday night in his study, just hours after
urging fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies to
create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its
seven-decade strangehold on political power.
``A distinguished scientist and public figure, a man of honesty
and sincerity has passed away,'' the obituary said. ``Everything
that Andrei Dmitrievich did was dictated by his conscience, his
deep humanitarian convictions.''
The obituary noted Sakharov was exiled in the industrial city of
Gorky about 250 miles east of Moscow from 1980 to 1986.
``Gross injustices were permitted in relation to A.D.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
It was signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo members Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov, Vadim A. Medvedev, Lev N. Zaikov, Alexander N. Yakovlev
and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.
</P>
<P>
However, the signatures of several other Politburo members,
including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservative
Yegor K. Ligachev were missing. Absence of their signatures could
signify that the disagreed with part of the obituary.
</P>
<P>
Ligachev, interviewed by the Tass news agency on Friday, had
said he disagreed with Sakharov but respected him.
</P>
<P>
It was Leonid I. Brezhnev, now blamed by Gorbachev for
permitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system,
who exiled Sakharov for criticizing the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told him
he could return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader told reporters at the Congress of People's
Deputies that Sakharov's death was a ``great loss.''
Even though the two often tangled at the Congress, Gorbachev
said he respected Sakharov. ``He was not some sort of political
intriguer,'' the Soviet president said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he would attend Sakharov's funeral Monday
afternoon in southwest Moscow's Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people gathered outside Sakharov's apartment
building Friday evening, holding candles and wreathing his
photograph in flowers. Memorial services were scheduled Sunday at
the city's main youth center, and on Monday at the Lebedev physics
institute where Sakharov worked and the Academy of Sciences, of
which he was a leading member.
</P>
<P>
The popular nighttime TV program ``Vzglad'' showed a brief
interview with his widow, Yelena Bonner, discussing the funeral
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The obituary also praised Sakharov's vision as a scientist,
which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences
at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the
Soviet hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
But it said that Sakharov realized the danger of the weapon he
had helped create.
``Working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction, A.D.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wide
production and testing, and stubbornly placed before the government
the question of limiting such tests,'' it said.
``But at that time his appeals were not accepted,'' it said.
``He kept these same positions in the future.''

Outpouring of Grief For Sakharov

Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs UPDATING estimate of people viewing body.
Picks up 4th graf, ``My God! ...

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief
Sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of Andrei
D. Sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as
his country's conscience.
</P>
<P>
Crimean Tatars and Jewish refuseniks _ two of the groups
Sakharov helped _ joined rank-and-file Communists, teachers and
engineers in filing past the body of the physicist, Nobel Peace
Prize winner, human rights advocate and legislator.
</P>
<P>
Based on official sources, an estimated 45,000 people filed
through, and the flow of mourners continued into the night. A
friend of the family, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
heard estimates that 70,000 mourners viewed the body before it was
returned to Sakharov's apartment at midnight.
``My God! Forgive us!'' one elderly woman cried out as she saw
Sakharov's body in an open coffin, sloping to the floor of the
beige marble Youth Palace in central Moscow. She apparently meant
to apologize for not recognizing his contributions earlier.
</P>
<P>
A mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at Sakharov's
feet, and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing Sakharov
with his hands over his mouth, deep in thought. An organ and piano
alternated dirges.
</P>
<P>
Sakharov died Thursday alone in his study at the age of 68,
apparently of a heart attack, ending a three-decade fight against
the jailing of innocent people, for free emigration, for
disarmament and other causes.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies, and the
outpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized and
committed to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remote
city of Gorky.
</P>
<P>
There were signs of grief throughout this snowy capital of 9
million people, as though a government leader had died. The huge
line of mourners, sometimes four deep and heavily bundled against
below-zero temperatures, stretched a mile from the palace and
poured continuously out of a subway station.
</P>
<P>
So many people wanted to see Sakharov's body lying in state that
authorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved the
coffin so two rows of mourners could file past.
</P>
<P>
Roald Z. Sagdeyev, a member of the official funeral commission,
said about 3,000 people an hour were arriving initially, but the
official news agency Tass said that rate doubled later, making for
a total of 45,000 by nighttime.
</P>
<P>
Police lined the sidewalks where people waited. Sakharov's widow
Yelena Bonner, pleased authorities were not turning people away,
praised them for being ``very democratic.''
In her first detailed public comments on her husband's death,
Bonner said she hopes he will not be idolized.
``I would not wish a living person _ he has lived an animated,
happy life _ to be turned into an icon, an icon which could be used
by various forces in their interests,'' Bonner said in an interview
broadcast on Soviet TV.
</P>
<P>
She said, however, that she hopes Sakharov's writings, published
abroad long ago, will become widely available in his homeland so
there can be a conversation of ``the people of the future with
Andrei Dmitrievich.''
Mourners carried small portraits of Sakharov and red and white
carnations to place near his coffin. One man, Sergei Kosykh,
brought his 7-year-old daughter along.
``My daughter, who is being brought up with the belief that
there is nobody greater than (Soviet founder Vladimir) Lenin, I
have brought her here today just to show her the person greater
than Lenin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged woman drew from Russian literature to reflect on
Sakharov's contributions.
``He was like the man from one of Maxim Gorky's tales who used
his own bleeding and living heart as a torch to lead people to
light and truth,'' said the woman, a teacher who declined to give
her name.
``Sakharov always was telling the truth and by doing so forced
our leadership to do the same,'' said Boris Sorokin, a 50-year-old
designer.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial shrines sprouted outside Sakharov's southeast Moscow
apartment, where candles flickered alongside his portrait. Outside
the offices of the weekly newspaper Moscow News on Pushkin Square,
a popular gathering place for political activists, portraits and
flowers were displayed.
</P>
<P>
An entry in a notebook for mourners' comments outside Sakharov's
apartment building declared, ``The conscience of the nation has
died.''
Moscow News _ an organ of the official press, which had branded
Sakharov an ``utterly ignorant person'' _ took the rare step Sunday
of publishing a special edition devoted to the activist.
</P>
<P>
Four pages were filled with pictures of him, condolence
telegrams from exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and President
Bush and a text of Sakharov's last public remarks, a speech he
delivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviet
hierarchy was ``leading the country to a catastrophe.''
On Sunday night, Soviet TV's newscast ``Seven Days'' also paid
tribute to Sakharov, leading the program with a 10-minute report on
him.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily Pravda published a poem by Yevgeny
Yevtushenko that read in part:
``History's most peaceful rebel, in dying, did not come down
from the cross, but left a horrifying hole in the moral fabric of
the world.''
On Saturday, Pravda published what amounted to a public apology
to Sakharov.
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders said in
an obituary that Sakharov had been the victim of ``gross
injustices'' and praised him as a ``man of honesty and sincerity.''
Bonner, Sakharov's constant companion and fellow human rights
activist, sat closest to the coffin, clutching a black handbag and
periodically closing her eyes. A son and daughter from his first
marriage and son and daughter of Bonner also attended, along with
four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was expected to pay his last respects Monday, when the
funeral is planned, and on Sunday was represented by Yevgeny M.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, chairman of the funeral commission and a non-voting
member of the country's ruling Politburo.
</P>
<P>
The foreign dignitaries expected to take part in Monday's
ceremonies include Lech Walesa, head of Poland's Solidarity
movement, who will be making his first trip to the Soviet Union,
and former refuseniks Yosef Begun and Vladimir Slepak, who now live
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel's best known Soviet dissident, Natan Sharansky, was
refused a visa when he applied for permission to travel to Moscow,
said Sharansky's spokesman, Avraham Ben-Yaakov. Begun and Slepak
said they would lay a wreath on Sakharov's grave in Sharansky's
name.

<P>
In a major rebuff to the Soviet Union's scientific establishment, Soviet 
physicists Friday nominated Nobel laureate Andrei D. Sakharov to run as a 
candidate in nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for March. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming vote in favor of the 67-year-old human-rights advocate by his 
colleagues at Moscow's leading physics institute came only two days after his 
candidacy was rejected by the governing board of the Academy of Sciences. The 
attempt to prevent Sakharov from running for a revamped Soviet Parliament has 
outraged Soviet intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
During a marathon session that ended late Wednesday, the governing board of the 
Academy of Sciences selected 23 scientists as candidates to fill 25 specially 
reserved seats in the new Congress of People's Deputies. Sakharov and several 
other leading reformers, including the former director of the Soviet space 
institute, Roald Sagdeyev, failed to win nomination.

physicists supported Sakharov's candidacy by a vote of 1,543 to 22. The outcome 
was more an expression of respect for Sakharov as a man who stuck by his 
principles during difficult times than a specific endorsement of all his 
political views. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, however, used the occasion to outline his hopes for a multiparty 
system, public control over the KGB security police, and the convergence of 
communism and capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sakharov has publicly expressed his support for President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, in recent months he seems to have become increasingly concerned 
about the slow and uneven pace of reform. In a question-and-answer session with 
physicists, he described the political situation in the Soviet Union as 
"extremely complicated." 
</P>
<P>
'Far From Delighted' 
</P>
<P>
"I am far from being delighted about all the things that have happened in our 
country over the last year. In many ways, our domestic policies have either 
been indecisive or incorrect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, who acted as an unofficial Kremlin envoy to the troubled 
Transcaucasian region last month, said he was particularly dismayed by a 
government crackdown against leading Armenian nationalists. He called for the 
release from prison of members of the outlawed Karabakh Committee, which has 
been campaigning for the secession of the largely Armenian-inhabited region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner outlined a detailed political program which, 
if implemented, would totally transform the Soviet Union. He called for total 
freedom of movement and association. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sakharov has now been nominated as a candidate from the October 
electoral district of Moscow, it is by no means certain that his name will 
appear on the March 26 ballot. Under the complicated voting procedures, it is 
still possible to strike down his candidacy during the so-called "pre-electoral 
campaign" if more than two candidates have been nominated.

SOVIET UNION NEAR ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE, SAKHAROV WARNS 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MILAN, Italy 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said Sunday that his country is 
on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized 
system are too slow in arriving. 
</P>
<P>
While praising the new course in world affairs taken by the Soviet Union, as 
demonstrated by its withdrawal from Afghanistan, Sakharov told the congress of 
the Italian Socialist Party that some aspects of internal affairs are "deeply 
disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
"We all know about the serious economic situation which can only get worse. The 
budget deficit has reached astronomical proportions of more than 100 billion 
rubles ($160 billion). Economic reforms are proceeding slower and slower and 
people are losing interest in them because they can't buy anything. 
</P>
<P>
"The old centralized system is being dismantled, and that is right. But the 
trouble is that it is not being replaced by anything new. We can say that the 
country is on the brink of an economic catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, who did not mention the name of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
described as "anti-democratic" some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest, 
particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in 
Soviet Georgia earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The physicist also attacked new legislation on personal responsibility now 
under consideration in Moscow. He said the laws could restrict freedom of 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Russian without notes, he said the new laws were supposed to take 
the place of measures used against dissidents like himself in the 1970s and 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov was elected in April to the new Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, 
just two years after he was released from seven years of internal exile.

SAKHAROV PRAISED AS CHAMPION OF FREEDOM 
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World leaders from President Bush to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today 
praised Andrei D. Sakharov as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived his 
Soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root throughout 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old scientist and human rights activist died Thursday of an 
apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Congress stood for a minute of silence for their colleague, once 
considered a national hero for discovering the Soviet hydrogen bomb but later 
reviled by Kremlin leadership for his uncompromising stands for human freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile, called 
Sakharov a "man of conviction and sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great loss," Gorbachev said. "He was a person who had his own ideas, 
his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly. This doesn't mean I 
agreed with him, although on many things we did agree." 
</P>
<P>
One Soviet lawmaker called Sakharov a man "such as maybe appears once in a 
hundred years." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that "all of us are diminished" and that Sakharov "embodied all of 
what is good and decent in the human spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a message of condolence to Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner, said: "All 
of us who knew him will never forget his courage and devotion to freedom. . . . 
Just as he truly enriched all of us with his life, all of us are diminished by 
his untimely death." 
</P>
<P>
Aase Lionaes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that awarded Sakharov 
the Peace Prize in 1975, said he "fell in the struggle for democratic reforms. 
His death represents a great loss, especially at a time with hopes of a 
positive development in the Soviet Union and in all Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Political leaders worldwide commended Sakharov as a man whose causes went 
beyond ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Lech Walesa, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said Sakharov's death was "a 
great loss for reform both in the Soviet Union and everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a remarkable person," said British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher. "He was one of those who would always say the truth must be found and 
was never afraid of stating that and letting everyone know." 
</P>
<P>
"It is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer future of the Soviet 
Union," she told reporters in London. 
</P>
<P>
In Strasbourg, France, the 518-member European Parliament unanimously paid 
tribute to Sakharov, whose name it had given to its Human Rights Prize. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the NATO foreign ministers hailed Sakharov as a pioneer who helped 
change Soviet society. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said, "The 
ministers expressed deeply felt sense of loss at the passing of Andrei 
Sakharov."
