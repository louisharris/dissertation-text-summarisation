FT  18 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bombs rock Bombay in budget aftermath -
RC Murthy on a market which has seen speculation, and savage disappointment
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, was rocked
by two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured. The
market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal.
</P>
<P>
It has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day, and
dealing has moved back to the traditional ring, where it stopped a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Dealers seemed to like this, the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday
and Tuesday. But another bomb blast in Calcutta triggered nervous selling
yesterday, and the index came back by 50.62, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,409.23.
</P>
<P>
All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity
market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with
unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27,
and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the
budget at the end of last month. He postponed corporate tax reforms by a
year, denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group. He did
reduce excise and import duties on a broad front, but left out the cement
and steel sectors, where share prices had been boosted by pre-budget
speculation.
</P>
<P>
To top it all, Dr Singh refused to equate domestic investors with their
overseas counterparts in taxing short-term capital gains. He lowered the tax
to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors
but for local investors it remained at 44.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Taking the tax concessions for granted, traders had driven up share prices
in February to make a kill later. Instead, the budget turned out to be a
nightmare. While industry and business welcomed the statement which, for
once, did not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock
market theorist and academic, said a reduction in import duties would leave
corporate profits ex-growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders
sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless
as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low. Overseas investors fuelled the
downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of Reliance Industries,
arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the
market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (GDRs).
</P>
<P>
The opportunity arose after a change in Indian regulations which allows
international investors to convert GDRs into the underlying stock. At the
current conversion rate of Rs31 per US dollar, the Reliance GDR fetched
Rs170 per share against the BSE quotation of Rs210.
</P>
<P>
The BSE 30-share index plunged by more than one-fifth to 2,287 on March 10,
from 2,893 at the post-budget trading session on February 27. Share prices
rebounded last week, taking the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance,
has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend on the
ability of bulls to maintain their momentum. They are hoping that foreign
portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after
'Black Friday', and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by
international investors.
</P>
<P>
The Indian stock markets have been passing through a series of crises since
December, when activists of the Bhartiya Janta party pulled down the Babri
mosque at Ayodhya, sparking off communal riots.
</P>
<P>
Mr Mark Bulloch of Jardine Fleming takes the domestic political situation in
his stride. 'Nothing dramatic has happened as far as foreign investors are
concerned,' he says. 'They are appraising the political situation.'
In the meantime, there is no compulsion for local investors to sell. In
this, they are more fortunate than they were in previous years, when they
were under pressure to take advantage of a long-term capital gains tax
exemption before the financial year ended in March. The exemption has been
replaced by a flat 20 per cent tax this year which, according to dealers,
puts bulls and bears on an even footing.

FT  17 MAR 93 / Explosion kills 45 in Calcutta
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
INDIA suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed
two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of Calcutta, killing at least
45 people and injuring scores of others.
</P>
<P>
Police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of
Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, causing two blocks of flats to collapse
and trapping up to 70 people in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five
days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a
series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of
Bombay.
</P>
<P>
A militant Sikh group fighting for independence for the Indian state of
Punjab has claimed responsibility for the Bombay blasts, but police are
unconvinced, saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance
with 'local criminals'.
</P>
<P>
In what many interpreted as a reference to Pakistan, with whom India has
fought three wars, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home
(interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi that he suspected 'an
international conspiracy.'
Most of the estimated 125 people living in the Calcutta flats were in their
beds when the blast occurred, setting fire to both buildings, according to
officials in the city's central control room. At least 45 people were dead
on arrival at hospital, they said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government
described as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart. Among the
targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a
shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
</P>
<P>
The attacks in Calcutta and Bombay are a severe setback to attempts to heal
the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep
shock throughout India.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after
the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on
December 6.
</P>
<P>
Some fear the wave of bomb attacks is designed to stir a renewal of communal
strife and undermine efforts by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to
open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Last night national and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt
to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore
rumours after the 'inhuman and criminal blast'.

FT  15 MAR 93 / Bombay stays calm in the face of horror: The city seems
determined to put Friday's outrage behind it
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay
stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken
concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255
people killed and over 1,200 injured.
</P>
<P>
'I'm lucky to be alive,' he said from his hospital bed. 'Who did this? Who
can stop this happening again?'
Across Bombay people were asking themselves the same questions this weekend.
</P>
<P>
They sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred
the city in December and again in January. Those were caused by a
traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem
hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya. The weapons
used were mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles.
</P>
<P>
Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology
terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers,
efficient organisation and money.
</P>
<P>
The only comparable previous incident was the assassination in 1991 of Mr
Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
But that was a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosions in Bombay were
designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital. Bombay accounts for
35 per cent of India's exports. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister,
described the blasts as an attack on India's economy.
</P>
<P>
The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of
Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign
help.
</P>
<P>
But these suggestions were seen in Bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect
attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects -
Moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit India
after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including
700 in Bombay.
</P>
<P>
If Moslems are found to have staged the attacks, the Indian authorities will
certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a Moslem country,
notably Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The implications would be vast. Breaking diplomatic relations would be the
minimum step Delhi could take on a dangerous road.
</P>
<P>
Mr Rao chose his words carefully during his visit to Bombay: 'There is a
definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country. I do
not want to name anybody because it will have ramifications within and
outside the country.'
There is no evidence linking the attacks to Moslem extremists, let alone to
Pakistan. Even if Moslem groups are found to be responsible for the
bombings, they could have been supplied from other Moslem countries. India
would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, such concerns seem remote from the streets on Bombay, where
the atmosphere yesterday was calm. Workmen were clearing away rubble at the
blast sites, including the blackened stock exchange building.
</P>
<P>
Bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them. At the Gymkhana
Club and dozens of other sports grounds, hundreds of men and boys were
playing cricket as they do every Sunday. Others were walking along the
seafront by the arch of the Gateway of India.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange authorities plan to re-start trading as soon as they can
-probably today - using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last
year.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life
and injuries and the damage caused to blasted buildings.
</P>
<P>
They did not expect the same widespread disruption to production as occurred
during the riots.
</P>
<P>
Some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and
the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troops to help
patrol sensitive districts. But much more should go to the people of Bombay,
who, so far at least, have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the
bombers.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Bombay blasts leave 200 dead: Federal troops flown in after
wave of bombings on commercial targets
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last
night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200
people and injuring more than a thousand.
</P>
<P>
The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a systematic attack on India's
commercial heart. All exploded within 90 minutes in the afternoon. Among the
targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a
shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the bombers was unknown, but the attacks were a severe
setback to India's attempts to heal the wounds created by recent
intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after
the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on
December 6.
</P>
<P>
The bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to
undermine efforts by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the
economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.
</P>
<P>
One of the targets was close to the headquarters of Shiv Sena, a Hindu
nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riots, in which
most victims were Moslems.
</P>
<P>
National and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent
a renewed outbreak of violence. Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumours
after the 'inhuman and criminal bomb blasts'.
</P>
<P>
Mr Sharad Pawar, the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief
minister of Maharashtra state, said all roads into Bombay had been blocked
and the army put on alert. He said: 'It is aimed at disrupting the economy
and it appears a conscious effort because only Bombay seems to be the
target.'
Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament
in New Delhi: 'We suspect an international conspiracy.'
The Indian High Commission in London said the attacks were 'part of the
externally supported terrorism which has targeted India for some time'.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian officials stopped short of directly accusing Pakistan, the
country's arch-enemy.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at
the city's better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which
victims were mainly poor.
</P>
<P>
At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people were on the
second-storey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car
park, hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street. Some
victims were crushed in the stampede to escape. Outside, burned bodies lay
among litter from shattered buildings.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Indian stock market denies flouting rules
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock
market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities
watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers'
books.
</P>
<P>
The Sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchange's rules,
including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of
members defaulting through excessive speculative investments.
</P>
<P>
It has also accused the exchange authorities of failing to enforce rules and
of poor administration.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange denied the allegations, saying they were 'baseless, made
out of context and blown out of proportion.'
The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market
where, as measured by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares
have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320
points fall since the government's budget was announced two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday the index closed at 2330. Foreign investors, who are being wooed
by India as a source of much-needed capital, will also be concerned at the
latest allegations of poor management at the exchange.
</P>
<P>
In one of its most damaging passages, the inspectors' report alleges that D
S Prabhoodas, a leading firm headed by Mr Hemendra Kothari, a former BSE
president, and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal, a member of the BSE's governing body,
avoided margin payments totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 4.08m).
</P>
<P>
Mr Kothari said yesterday that most of the transactions covered by the
report were off-exchange deals directly between financial institutions for
which margin payments were not required. Mr M R Mayya, the BSE's executive
director, said BSE rules permitted such bilateral off-exchange transactions.
</P>
<P>
Sebi also accused the exchange of mismanaging the administration of its
building.
</P>
<P>
This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which began
almost as soon as Sebi started operations a year ago. It was established by
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, as a crucial element in financial
reform.
</P>
<P>
Brokers claim the Sebi is heavy-handed and fails to understand their needs.
</P>
<P>
They say rules must be applied flexibly and many firms are extremely small
and unable to carry the cost of extra regulations.
</P>
<P>
But the finance minister is backing Sebi to the hilt and singled it out for
praise in his recent budget speech.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and
others to dodge taxes and also contributed to last year's securities market
scandal in which banks, including the UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lost a
combined gross total of Rs40bn.
