Hurricane Gilbert Heads Toward Dominican Coast
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Gilbert swept
toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted
its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy
rains and high seas.
</P>
<P>
The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustained
winds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph.
``There is no need for alarm,'' Civil Defense Director Eugenio
Cabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closely
follow Gilbert's movement. An estimated 100,000 people live in the
province, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 miles
west of Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and
strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The National
Hurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday at
latitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south of
Ponce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said
Gilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a ``broad area of
cloudiness and heavy weather'' rotating around the center of the
storm.
</P>
<P>
The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastal
flooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to Puerto
Rico's south coast. There were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gusts
Saturday, but they subsided during the night.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical
storm and its remnants pushed inland from the U.S. Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mph
winds and sheets of rain.
</P>
<P>
Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic storm
season, was the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimal
hurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast last
month.

Gilbert Reaches Jamaican Capital With 110 Mph Winds
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Gilbert, packing 110 mph
winds and torrential rain, moved over this capital city today after
skirting Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of casualties. Telephone
communications were affected.
``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``We've
already had reports of 110 mph winds on the eastern tip.
``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that
island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful
hurricane,'' Sheets said.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters say Gilbert was expected to lash Jamaica throughout
the day and was on track to later strike the Cayman Islands, a
small British dependency northwest of Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Havana Radio reported today that 25,000 people were
evacuated from Guantanamo Province on Cuba's southeastern coast as
strong winds fanning out from Gilbert began brushing the island.
</P>
<P>
All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International
Airport, while flights from Grand Cayman, the main island of the
three-island chain, arrived packed with frightened travelers.
``People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on
Grand Cayman) like chickens with their heads cut off,'' said one
vacationer who was returning home to California through Miami.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman Islands, Cuba and
Haiti. Warnings were discontinued for the Dominican Republic.
``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to
monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service
said, adding, ``Little change in strength is expected for the next
several hours as the hurricane moves westward over Jamaica.''
The Associated Press' Caribbean headquarters in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, was unable to get phone calls through to Kingston, where high
winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched the capital
overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering
streets with branches.
</P>
<P>
Most Jamaicans stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation
for the hurricane. Some companies broadcast appeals for technicians
and electricians to report to work.
</P>
<P>
The weather bureau predicted Gilbert's center, 140 miles
southeast of Kingston before dawn, would pass south of Kingston and
hit the southern parish of Clarendon.
</P>
<P>
Flash flood warnings were issued for the parishes of Portland on
the northeast and St. Mary on the north. The north coast tourist
region from Montego Bay on the west and Ocho Rios on the east, far
from the southern impact zone and separated by mountains, was
expected only to receive heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Officials urged residents in the higher risk areas along the
south coast to seek higher ground.
``It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the
Caribbean for a long time,'' said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the
National Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters at the center said the eye of Gilbert was 140 miles
southeast of Kingston at dawn today. Maximum sustained winds were
near 110 mph, with tropical-storm force winds extending up to 250
miles to the north and 100 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica alerted all government
agencies, saying Sunday night: ``Hurricane Gilbert appears to be a
real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and
hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness
in order to minimize the danger.''
Forecasters said the hurricane had been gaining strength as it
passed over the ocean after it dumped 5 to 10 inches of rain on the
Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of Hispaniola.
``We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to be
a major threat to the United States,'' said Martin Nelson, another
meteorologist at the center. ``It's moving at about 17 mph to the
west and normally hurricanes take a northward turn after they pass
central Cuba.''
Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency said a state of alert
was declared at midday in the Cuban provinces of Guantanamo,
Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Granma.
</P>
<P>
In the report from Havana received in Mexico City, Prensa Latina
said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on
national radio and television recommending emergency measures and
providing information on the storm.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused
flooding in the Dominican Republic on Sunday night as the
hurricane's center passed just south of the Barahona peninsula,
then less than 100 miles from neighboring Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The storm ripped the roofs off houses and flooded coastal areas
of southwestern Puerto Rico after reaching hurricane strength off
the island's southeast Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Flights were canceled Sunday in the Dominican Republic, where
civil defense director Eugenio Cabral reported some flooding in
parts of the capital of Santo Domingo and power outages there and
in other southern areas.

Hurricane Hits Jamaica With 115 mph Winds; Communications
Disrupted
</HL>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston
on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs
off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.
</P>
<P>
No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of
750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane
around noon.
</P>
<P>
For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing
branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through
the air.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston's
airport and aircraft parked on its fields.
</P>
<P>
The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across the
city. Skies brightened, the winds died down and people waited for
an hour before the second blow of the hurricane arrived.
</P>
<P>
All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Flights from the Cayman Islands, reportedly next in the path of
the hurricane, arrived in Miami packed with travelers cutting short
their vacations. ``People were running around in the main lobby of
our hotel (on Grand Cayman Island) like chickens with their heads
cut off,'' said one man.
</P>
<P>
A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was moving
west at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. It said
Jamaica would receive up to 10 inches of rain that would cause
flash floods and mud slides.
``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that
island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful
hurricane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico,
Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane warnings were issued
Monday for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the Cayman
Islands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched Kingston
overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering
streets with branches.
</P>
<P>
Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home, boarding up
windows in preparation for the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
The popular north coast resort area, on the other side of the
mountains, was expected to receive heavy rain but not as much
damage from the hurricane as the south coast, where officials urged
residents to seek higher ground.
</P>
<P>
Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were
evacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation's
southeastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush the
island.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various
precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ken Ross, a spokesman, said the Navy station at Guantanamo
reported that as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, the brunt of the storm appeared
to be passing southeastern Cuba. ``They have reported maximum winds
of 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots,'' said Ross. ``But there are
no reports of injuries or damage.''
The spokesman said earlier in the day, Guantanamo had moved to
``Condition Two,'' meaning electrical power usage was cut back to
only essential uses and ``all non-essential personnel sent to their
barracks.''
The storm also skirted Puerto Rico without causing any damage to
military facilities, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
Sheets said Gilbert was expected next to sweep over the Cayman
Islands, on its westward track, and in two to three days veer
northwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Residents of the
neighboring Caymans, a British dependency to the northwest, were
urged to ``rush all preparatory actions.''
The National Weather Service warned that the Caymans could
expect high waters and large waves ``which may undermine buildings
along the beaches.''
``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to
monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service
advised.
</P>
<P>
Forecaster Hal Gerrish on Sunday described Gilbert ``certainly
one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long
time.''

<P>
Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest
storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and
leveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off
the Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
Looters roamed the streets of Cancun, stealing from stores whose
windows were blown away. Huge waves battered the beach resorts and
thousands were evacuated. Despite the intensity of the onslaught
and the ensuing heavy flooding, officials reported only two minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica and five in the Dominican
Republic before moving west to Mexico. Prime Minister Edward Seaga
of Jamaica said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000
of Jamaica's 500,000 homes when it throttled the island Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier that 500,000 of the
nation's 2.3 million people were homeless.
</P>
<P>
In Cancun, amateur radio operators said an oil tanker from the
fleet of the government oil monopoly Pemex, the Lazaro Cardenas,
had run aground on the beach in the Cancun hotel zone. Pemex
officials however said all their vessels were secure.
</P>
<P>
Army officials in Mexico City said about 35,000 people were
evacuated from Cancun, but Cancun Mayor Jose Sanchez Zapata said
about 11,000 fled.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 people on the northeast Yucatan coast were
evacuated, the Yucatan state government said.
</P>
<P>
The eye of the storm passed over Cozumel and Cancun with howling
winds clocked at 160 mph at about 8 a.m. EDT. The winds bent and
toppled utility poles and uprooted slum dwellings.
</P>
<P>
Ham radio operators around Cancun said Gilbert knocked down a
radio and television communications tower, uprooted trees and blew
the roofs off buildings.
</P>
<P>
Floods prevented officials from reaching the hotel zone in
Cancun and there were no relief efforts under way by late
Wednesday. Shelters had little or no food, water or blankets and
power was out.
``We can't do it yet. The wind would blow them away,'' said an
army official at city hall who declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
Bands of 25-30 youths roamed the streets of Cancun Wednesday,
looting stores with shattered windows, said Alfredo Moro Sanchez,
investigative coordinator of the Quintana Roo state judicial police.
</P>
<P>
He said he asked for army troops to halt the looting but none
had arrived by late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 150 tourists took refuge at the Cancun city hall.
</P>
<P>
Honeymooner Sheila Fournier of Long Island said she and her
husband, Pete, had been evacuated from the Villas Playa Hotel.
``It had an ocean-front view _ which is now washed away,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
Officials were checking low-lying areas of Cancun for stranded
residents. There was heavy damage visible to the humble wood and
thatch homes typical of the Yucatan.
``There were some people who did not want to leave yesterday,''
the army official said. ``It was something new. They didn't know
what a cyclone was.''
At midnight EDT Gilbert was centered near latitude 21.5 north,
longitude 90.2 west and approaching the north coast of Yucatan,
about 60 miles east-northeast of the provincial capital, Merida,
the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said. The
storm was about 550 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, the
center said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was moving west-northwest at 15 mph and winds had
decreased to 125 mph. The Mexican National Weather Service reported
winds gusting as high as 218 mph earlier Wednesday with sustained
winds of 179 mph.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm,
the strongest ad deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have
maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause
catastrophic damage.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday night the National Hurricane Center downgraded it
to a Category 4, but center director Bob Sheets said:``There's no
question it'll strengthen again once it comes off the Yucatan
Peninsula and gets back in open water.''
As Gilbert moved away from the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday
night, the hurricane formed a double eye, two concentric circles of
thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has
crossed land and is moving over the water again.
</P>
<P>
One eye was about eight miles wide, and the second about 25
miles wide, said hurricane center meteorologist Jesse Moore. ``This
is one of the features that we expected to see as the hurricane
moved back over the water, and we do expect intensification,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the
1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille
that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256 people.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the
Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The peninsula ports of Campeche, Celestum, Progreso, Sinzal,
Ucaltepen, Tel-Chac, Cancun, Puerto Morelos, and Ciudad del Carmen
were closed, the government news agency Notimex said. Airports in
the region were closed.
``The sound of the wind outside is horrible,'' said receptionist
Pablo Torres at Cancun's Hotel Carrillos as the storm approached.
</P>
<P>
The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane watch was in
effect on the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur and along
the coast of northeast Mexico from Tampico north.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City, the National Civil Defense System said it lost
telephone contact with Cancun and Cozumel at about 8 a.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
Public buildings in Cancun were used as shelters, said Cecila
Lavalle, a spokesman for Quintana Roo state government in Chetumal,
155 miles southeast of Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
Jennie Valdez, a U.S. consular representative in Cancun, said
she did not know how many tourists were in Cancun, but government
figures estimate 40,000 to 65,000 monthly visitors.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane warnings were in effect for the entire Yucatan
Peninsula and widespread evacuations were reported.
</P>
<P>
Winds destroyed at least 100 homes in slums of Valladolid, a
town of about 45,000 about 100 miles from Cozumel, Alberto Pol, a
judicial police officer, said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
The National Hurricane Center said Gilbert was the most intense
storm on record in terms of barometric pressure. It was measured at
26.31 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935
hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western
Hemisphere,'' said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Gilbert pounded the Dominican
Republic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
Seaga said Jamaica would need $8 billion in aid. Officials in
the Dominican Republic, sideswiped Sunday by the storm, reported
five dead.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert also buffeted the Cayman Islands, but no deaths were
reported.

Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low
pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of
Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that
baffles forecasters.
``It's a matter of getting everything together in the right
place in the right time,'' Gil Clark of the National Hurricane
Center said Thursday. ``It doesn't happen very often. How it
develops, we don't know.''
Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a
dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.
``We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer. About one of
six develop,'' said Clark.
</P>
<P>
By Sept. 8, the system became a depression. It reached tropical
storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.
</P>
<P>
When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named
tropical storm. It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds
hit 74 mph.
</P>
<P>
Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems
didn't ``is a mystery more or less,'' said University of Miami
meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.
``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails,
wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop,'' he said
Thursday. ``That's something meteorologists would like to know more
about.''
But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once
development begins. And they know that development is sparked when
winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.
``If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in
the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this
convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' Bleck
said.
``If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the clouds
occasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergence
pattern. That strengthens it,'' he said, adding that storms can
begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a vortex is created.
``Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning.
</P>
<P>
That's what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, those
winter storms,'' Bleck said.
</P>
<P>
Hurricanes ``are useful to the climate machine. Their primary
role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,''
he said. ``The sun puts energy into the water, the top of the
oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere. That has to be
distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere.''
When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados,
warm Atlantic waters nurtured it.
``This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best for
development,'' Clark said. ``If you get a storm in this area in
September, when the water's warmest, it can just explode. This is
where Camille formed and exploded,'' referring to the 1969 storm
that slammed into the Gulf Coast.
``It is an exciting thing to watch. If you're on the beach
watching the storm surge, it's a different story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on
record in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inches
Tuesday night. That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricane
that devastated the Florida Keys.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dominican Republic, all domestic flights and flights to and from Puerto Rico and Miami were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean island they share, and headed west. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still gaining strength. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time," said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m. EDT, the center of the hurricane was about 100 miles south of the Dominican Republic and 425 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
The hurricane was moving west at about 15 mph and was expected to continue this motion for the next 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the hurricane's track would take it about 50 miles south of southwestern Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
The hurricane center said small craft in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should remain in port until conditions improve. 
</P>
<P>
The forecasters said the Dominican Republic would get as much as 10 inches of rain yesterday, with similar amounts falling in Haiti last night and tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane warnings were issued for the south coast of Haiti and Cuba by their respective governments. 
</P>
<P>
In Jamaica, the government issued a hurricane watch for the entire island. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
In Puerto Rico, besides tearing off several roofs, the storm caused coastal flooding and brought down power lines and trees along roads and highways in the west and southwestern regions. 
</P>
<P>
Three people were injured in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, when a tree fell on their vehicle as they traveled along Route 97, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Four policemen stationed on Mona Island, between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, were stranded as a result of the weather.
